year of glad
i am seated in an office  surrounded by heads and bodies  my posture is consciously congruent to the shape of my hard chair 
this is a cold room in university administration  wood walled  remington hung  double windowed against the november heat 
insulated from administrative sounds by the reception area outside  at which uncle charles  mr  delint and i were lately received 
i am in here 
three faces have resolved into place above summer weight sportcoats and half windsors across a polished pine conference
table shiny with the spidered light of an arizona noon  these are three deans   of admissions  academic affairs  athletic
affairs  i do not know which face belongs to whom 
i believe i appear neutral  maybe even pleasant  though i ve been coached to err on the side of neutrality and not attempt what
would feel to me like a pleasant expression or smile 
i have committed to crossing my legs i hope carefully  ankle on knee  hands together in the lap of my slacks  my fingers are
mated into a mirrored series of what manifests  to me  as the letter x  the interview room s other personnel include  the
university s director of composition  its varsity tennis coach  and academy prorector mr  a  delint  c t  is beside me  the others
sit  stand and stand  respectively  at the periphery of my focus  the tennis coach jingles pocket change  there is something
vaguely digestive about the room s odor  the high traction sole of my complimentary nike sneaker runs parallel to the wobbling
loafer of my mother s half brother  here in his capacity as headmaster  sitting in the chair to what i hope is my immediate right 
also facing deans 
the dean at left  a lean yellowish man whose fixed smile nevertheless has the impermanent quality of something stamped
into uncooperative material  is a personality type i ve come lately to appreciate  the type who delays need of any response from
me by relating my side of the story for me  to me  passed a packet of computer sheets by the shaggy lion of a dean at center  he is
speaking more or less to these pages  smiling down 
 you are harold incandenza  eighteen  date of secondary school graduation approximately one month from now  attending the
enfield tennis academy  enfield  massachusetts  a boarding school  where you reside   his reading glasses are rectangular  courtshaped  the sidelines at top and bottom   you are  according to coach white and dean  unintelligible   a regionally  nationally 
and continentally ranked junior tennis player  a potential o n a n c a a  athlete of substantial promise  recruited by coach
white via correspondence with dr  tavis here commencing      february of this year   the top page is removed and brought
around neatly to the bottom of the sheaf  at intervals   you have been in residence at the enfield tennis academy since age
seven  
i am debating whether to risk scratching the right side of my jaw  where there is a wen 
 coach white informs our offices that he holds the enfield tennis academy s program and achievements in high regard  that
the university of arizona tennis squad has profited from the prior matriculation of several former e t a  alumni  one of whom
was one mr  aubrey f  delint  who appears also to be with you here today  coach white and his staff have given us   
the yellow administrator s usage is on the whole undistinguished  though i have to admit he s made himself understood  the
director of composition seems to have more than the normal number of eyebrows  the dean at right is looking at my face a bit
strangely 
uncle charles is saying that though he can anticipate that the deans might be predisposed to weigh what he avers as coming
from his possible appearance as a kind of cheerleader for e t a   he can assure the assembled deans that all this is true  and that
the academy has presently in residence no fewer than a third of the continent s top thirty juniors  in age brackets all across the
board  and that i here  who go by  hal   usually  am  right up there among the very cream   right and center deans smile
professionally  the heads of delint and the coach incline as the dean at left clears his throat 
   belief that you could well make  even as a freshman  a real contribution to this university s varsity tennis program  we are
pleased   he either says or reads  removing a page   that a competition of some major sort here has brought you down and given us
the chance to sit down and chat together about your application and potential recruitment and matriculation and scholarship  
 i ve been asked to add that hal here is seeded third  boys     and under singles  in the prestigious whataburger southwest
junior invitational out at the randolph tennis center    says what i infer is athletic affairs  his cocked head showing a freckled
scalp 
 out at randolph park  near the outstanding el con marriott   c t  inserts   a venue the whole contingent s been vocal about
finding absolutely top hole thus far  which   
 just so  chuck  and that according to chuck here hal has already justified his seed  he s reached the semifinals as of this
morning s apparently impressive win  and that he ll be playing out at the center again tomorrow  against the winner of a
quarterfinal game tonight  and so will be playing tomorrow at i believe scheduled for        
 try to get under way before the godawful heat out there  though of course a dry heat  
   and has apparently already qualified for this winter s continental indoors  up in edmonton  kirk tells me    cocking
further to look up and left at the varsity coach  whose smile s teeth are radiant against a violent sunburn    which is something
indeed   he smiles  looking at me   did we get all that right hal  
c t  has crossed his arms casually  their triceps  flesh is webbed with mottle in the air conditioned sunlight   you sure did 
bill   he smiles  the two halves of his mustache never quite match   and let me say if i may that hal s excited  excited to be
invited for the third year running to the invitational again  to be back here in a community he has real affection for  to visit with
your alumni and coaching staff  to have already justified his high seed in this week s not unstiff competition  to as they say still be
in it without the fat woman in the viking hat having sung  so to speak  but of course most of all to have a chance to meet you
gentlemen and have a look at the facilities here  everything here is absolutely top slot  from what he s seen  
there is a silence  delint shifts his back against the room s panelling and recenters his weight  my uncle beams and

 straightens a straight watchband        of the room s faces are directed my way  pleasantly expectant  my chest bumps like a
dryer with shoes in it  i compose what i project will be seen as a smile  i turn this way and that  slightly  sort of directing the
expression to everyone in the room 
there is a new silence  the yellow dean s eyebrows go circumflex  the two other deans look to the director of composition 
the tennis coach has moved to stand at the broad window  feeling at the back of his crewcut  uncle charles strokes the forearm
above his watch  sharp curved palm shadows move slightly over the pine table s shine  the one head s shadow a black moon 
 is hal all right  chuck   athletic affairs asks   hal just seemed to     well  grimace  is he in pain  are you in pain  son  
 hal s right as rain   smiles my uncle  soothing the air with a casual hand   just a bit of a let s call it maybe a facial tic  slightly 
at all the adrenaline of being here on your impressive campus  justifying his seed so far without dropping a set  receiving that
official written offer of not only waivers but a living allowance from coach white here  on pac    letterhead  being ready in all
probability to sign a national letter of intent right here and now this very day  he s indicated to me   c t  looks to me  his look
horribly mild  i do the safe thing  relaxing every muscle in my face  emptying out all expression  i stare carefully into the
kekulean knot of the middle dean s necktie 
my silent response to the expectant silence begins to affect the air of the room  the bits of dust and sportcoat lint stirred
around by the ac s vents dancing jaggedly in the slanted plane of windowlight  the air over the table like the sparkling space just
above a fresh poured seltzer  the coach  in a slight accent neither british nor australian  is telling c t  that the whole applicationinterface process  while usually just a pleasant formality  is probably best accentuated by letting the applicant speak up for
himself  right and center deans have inclined together in soft conference  forming a kind of tepee of skin and hair  i presume it s
probably facilitate that the tennis coach mistook for accentuate  though accelerate  while clunkier than facilitate  is from a phonetic
perspective more sensible  as a mistake  the dean with the flat yellow face has leaned forward  his lips drawn back from his teeth
in what i see as concern  his hands come together on the conference table s surface  his own fingers look like they mate as my
own four x series dissolves and i hold tight to the sides of my chair 
we need candidly to chat re potential problems with my application  they and i  he is beginning to say  he makes a reference
to candor and its value 
 the issues my office faces with the application materials on file from you  hal  involve some test scores   he glances down at
a colorful sheet of standardized scores in the trench his arms have made   the admissions staff is looking at standardized test
scores from you that are  as i m sure you know and can explain  are  shall we say     subnormal   i m to explain 
it s clear that this really pretty sincere yellow dean at left is admissions  and surely the little aviarian figure at right is
athletics  then  because the facial creases of the shaggy middle dean are now pursed in a kind of distanced affront  an i m eatingsomething that makes me really appreciate the presence of whatever i m drinking along with it look that spells professionally
academic reservations  an uncomplicated loyalty to standards  then  at center  my uncle looks to athletics as if puzzled  he shifts
slightly in his chair 
the incongruity between admissions s hand  and face color is almost wild    verbal scores that are just quite a bit closer to
zero than we re comfortable with  as against a secondary school transcript from the institution where both your mother and her
brother are administrators    reading directly out of the sheaf inside his arms  ellipse    that this past year  yes  has fallen off a
bit  but by the word i mean  fallen off  to outstanding from three previous years of frankly incredible  
 off the charts  
 most institutions do not even have grades of a with multiple pluses after it   says the director of composition  his expression
impossible to interpret 
 this kind of     how shall i put it    incongruity   admissions says  his expression frank and concerned   i ve got to tell you
sends up a red flag of potential concern during the admissions process  
 we thus invite you to explain the appearance of incongruity if not outright shenanigans   students has a tiny piping voice
that s absurd coming out of a face this big 
 surely by incredible you meant very very very impressive  as opposed to literally quote  incredible   surely   says c t  
seeming to watch the coach at the window massaging the back of his neck  the huge window gives out on nothing more than
dazzling sunlight and cracked earth with heat shimmers over it 
 then there is before us the matter of not the required two but nine separate application essays  some of which of nearly
monograph length  each without exception being    different sheet    the adjective various evalua tors used was quote  stellar 
  
dir  of comp    i made in my assessment deliberate use of lapidary and effete  
   but in areas and with titles  i m sure you recall quite well  hal   neoclassical assumptions in contemporary prescriptive
grammar    the implications of post fourier transformations for a holographically mimetic cinema    the emergence of
heroic stasis in broadcast entertainment    
   montague grammar and the semantics of physical modality   
   a man who began to suspect he was made of glass   
   tertiary symbolism in justinian erotica   
now showing broad expanses of recessed gum   suffice to say that there s some frank and candid concern about the recipient
of these unfortunate test scores  though perhaps explainable test scores  being these essays  sole individual author  
 i m not sure hal s sure just what s being implied here   my uncle says  the dean at center is fingering his lapels as he
interprets distasteful computed data 
 what the university is saying here is that from a strictly academic point of view there are admission problems that hal needs
to try to help us iron out  a matriculant s first role at the university is and must be as a student  we couldn t admit a student we
have reason to suspect can t cut the mustard  no matter how much of an asset he might be on the field  
 dean sawyer means the court  of course  chuck   athletic affairs says  head severely cocked so he s including the white
person behind him in the address somehow   not to mention o n a n c a a  regulations and investigators always snuffling
around for some sort of whiff of the smell of impropriety  

 the varsity tennis coach looks at his own watch 
 assuming these board scores are accurate reflectors of true capacity in this case   academic affairs says  his high voice
serious and sotto  still looking at the file before him as if it were a plate of something bad  til tell you right now my opinion is it
wouldn t be fair  it wouldn t be fair to the other applicants  wouldn t be fair to the university community   he looks at me   and
it d be especially unfair to hal himself  admitting a boy we see as simply an athletic asset would amount to just using that boy 
we re under myriad scrutiny to make sure we re not using anybody  your board results  son  indicate that we could be accused of
using you  
uncle charles is asking coach white to ask the dean of athletic affairs whether the weather over scores would be as heavy
if i were  say  a revenue raising football prodigy  the familiar panic at feeling misperceived is rising  and my chest bumps and
thuds  i expend energy on remaining utterly silent in my chair  empty  my eyes two great pale zeros  people have promised to get
me through this 
uncle c t   though  has the pinched look of the cornered  his voice takes on an odd timbre when he s cornered  as if he were
shouting as he receded   hal s grades at e t a   which is i should stress an academy  not simply a camp or factory  accredited by
both the commonwealth of massachusetts and the north american sports academy association  it s focused on the total needs of
the player and student  founded by a towering intellectual figure whom i hardly need name  here  and based by him on the
rigorous oxbridge quadrivium trivium curricular model  a school fully staffed and equipped  by a fully certified staff  should
show that my nephew here can cut just about any pac    mustard that needs cutting  and that   
delint is moving toward the tennis coach  who is shaking his head 
   would be able to see a distinct flavor of minor sport prejudice about this whole thing   c t  says  crossing and recrossing
his legs as i listen  composed and staring 
the room s carbonated silence is now hostile  t think it s time to let the actual applicant himself speak out on his own behalf  
academic affairs says very quietly   this seems somehow impossible with you here  sir  
athletics smiles tiredly under a hand that massages the bridge of his nose   maybe you d excuse us for a moment and wait
outside  chuck  
 coach white could accompany mr  tavis and his associate out to reception   the yellow dean says  smiling into my
unfocused eyes 
   led to believe this had all been ironed out in advance  from the    c t  is saying as he and delint are shown to the door 
the tennis coach extends a hypertrophied arm  athletics says  we re all friends and colleagues here  
this is not working out  it strikes me that exit signs would look to a native speaker of latin like red lit signs that say he
leaves  i would yield to the urge to bolt for the door ahead of them if i could know that bolting for the door is what the men in this
room would see  delint is murmuring something to the tennis coach  sounds of keyboards  phone consoles as the door is briefly
opened  then firmly shut  i am alone among administrative heads 
   offense intended to anyone   athletic affairs is saying  his sportcoat tan and his necktie insigniated in tiny print    beyond
just physical abilities out there in play  which believe me we respect  want  believe me  
   question about it we wouldn t be so anxious to chat with you directly  see  
   that we ve known in processing several prior applications through coach white s office that the enfield school is
operated  however impressively  by close relations of first your brother  who i can still remember the way white s predecessor
maury klamkin wooed that kid  so that grades  objectivity can be all too easily called into question   
 by whomsoever s calling   n a a u p   ill willed pac    programs  o n a n c a a    
the essays are old ones  yes  but they are mine  de moi  but they are  yes  old  not quite on the application s instructed subject
of most meaningful educational experience ever  if i d done you one from the last year  it would look to you like some sort of
infant s random stabs on a keyboard  and to you  who use whomsoever as a subject  and in this new smaller company  the
director of composition seems abruptly to have actuated  emerged as both the alpha of the pack here and way more effeminate
than he d seemed at first  standing hip shot with a hand on his waist  walking with a roll to his shoulders  jingling change as he
pulls up his pants as he slides into the chair still warm from c t  s bottom  crossing his legs in a way that inclines him well into
my personal space  so that i can see multiple eyebrow tics and capillary webs in the oysters below his eyes and smell fabricsoftener and the remains of a breath mint turned sour 
       a bright  solid  but very shy boy  we know about your being very shy  kirk white s told us what your athletically built if
rather stand offish younger instructor told him   the director says softly  cupping what i feel to be a hand over my sportcoat s
biceps  surely not    who simply needs to swallow hard and trust and tell his side of the story to these gentlemen who bear no
maliciousness none at all but are doing our jobs and trying to look out for everyone s interests at the same time  
i can picture delint and white sitting with their elbows on their knees in the defecatory posture of all athletes at rest  delint
staring at his huge thumbs  while c t  in the reception area paces in a tight ellipse  speaking into his portable phone  i have been
coached for this like a don before a rico hearing  a neutral and affectless silence  the sort of all defensive game schtitt used to
have me play  the best defense  let everything bounce off you  do nothing  i d tell you all you want and more  if the sounds i made
could be what you hear 
athletics with his head out from under his wing     to avoid admission procedures that could be seen as primarily athleticsoriented  it could be a mess  son  
 bill means the appearance  not necessarily the real true facts of the matter  which you alone can fill in   says the director of
composition 
   the appearance of the high athletic ranking  the subnormal scores  the over academic essays  the incredible grades
vortexing out of what could be seen as a nepotistic situation  
the yellow dean has leaned so far forward that his tie is going to have a horizontal dent from the table edge  his face sallow
and kindly and no shit whatever 
 look here  mr  incandenza  hal  please just explain to me why we couldn t be accused of using you  son  why nobody could

 come and say to us  why  look here  university of arizona  here you are using a boy for just his body  a boy so shy and withdrawn
he won t speak up for himself  a jock with doctored marks and a store bought application  
the brewster s angle light of the tabletop appears as a rose flush behind my closed lids  i cannot make myself understood   i
am not just a jock   i say slowly  distinctly   my transcript for the last year might have been dickied a bit  maybe  but that was to
get me over a rough spot  the grades prior to that are de moi   my eyes are closed  the room is silent   i cannot make myself
understood  now   i am speaking slowly and distinctly   call it something i ate  
it s funny what you don t recall  our first home  in the suburb of weston  which i barely remember   my eldest brother orin
says he can remember being in the home s backyard with our mother in the early spring  helping the moms till some sort of garden
out of the cold yard  march or early april  the garden s area was a rough rectangle laid out with popsicle sticks and twine  orin
was removing rocks and hard clods from the moms s path as she worked the rented rototiller  a wheelbarrow shaped  gas driven
thing that roared and snorted and bucked and he remembers seemed to propel the moms rather than vice versa  the moms very tall
and having to stoop painfully to hold on  her feet leaving drunken prints in the tilled earth  he remembers that in the middle of the
tilling i came tear assing out the door and into the backyard wearing some sort of fuzzy red pooh wear  crying  holding out
something he said was really unpleasant looking in my upturned palm  he says i was around five and crying and was vividly red
in the cold spring air  i was saying something over and over  he couldn t make it out until our mother saw me and shut down the
tiller  ears ringing  and came over to see what i was holding out  this turned out to have been a large patch of mold   orin posits
from some dark corner of the weston home s basement  which was warm from the furnace and flooded every spring  the patch
itself he describes as horrific  darkly green  glossy  vaguely hirsute  speckled with parasitic fungal points of yellow  orange  red 
worse  they could see that the patch looked oddly incomplete  gnawed on  and some of the nauseous stuff was smeared around
my open mouth   i ate this   was what i was saying  i held the patch out to the moms  who had her contacts out for the dirty work 
and at first  bending way down  saw only her crying child  hand out  proffering  and in that most maternal of reflexes she  who
feared and loathed more than anything spoilage and filth  reached to take whatever her baby held out   as in how many used
heavy kleenex  spit back candies  wads of chewed out gum in how many theaters  airports  backseats  tournament lounges  o 
stood there  he says  hefting a cold clod  playing with the velcro on his puffy coat  watching as the moms  bent way down to me 
hand reaching  her lowering face with its presbyopic squint  suddenly stopped  froze  beginning to i d  what it was i held out 
countenancing evidence of oral contact with same  he remembers her face as past describing  her outstretched hand  still
rototrembling  hung in the air before mine 
 i ate this   i said 
 pardon me  
o  says he can only remember  sic  saying something caustic as he lim boed a crick out of his back  he says he must have felt
a terrible impending anxiety  the moms refused ever even to go into the damp basement  i had stopped crying  he remembers  and
simply stood there  the size and shape of a hydrant  in red pj s with attached feet  holding out the mold  seriously  like the report of
some kind of audit 
o  says his memory diverges at this point  probably as a result of anxiety  in his first memory  the moms s path around the
yard is a broad circle of hysteria 
 god   she calls out 
 help  my son ate this   she yells in orin s second and more fleshed out recollection  yelling it over and over  holding the
speckled patch aloft in a pincer of fingers  running around and around the garden s rectangle while o  gaped at his first real sight
of adult hysteria  suburban neighbors  heads appeared in windows and over the fences  looking  o  remembers me tripping over
the garden s laid out twine  getting up dirty  crying  trying to follow 
 god  help  my son ate this  help   she kept yelling  running a tight pattern just inside the square of string  and my brother
orin remembers noting how even in hysterical trauma her flight lines were plumb  her footprints native american straight  her
turns  inside the ideogram of string  crisp and martial  crying  my son ate this  help   and lapping me twice before the memory
recedes 
 my application s not bought   i am telling them  calling into the darkness of the red cave that opens out before closed eyes   i
am not just a boy who plays tennis  i have an intricate history  experiences and feelings  i m complex 
 i read   i say   i study and read  i bet i ve read everything you ve read  don t think i haven t  i consume libraries  i wear out
spines and rom drives  i do things like get in a taxi and say   the library  and step on it   my instincts concerning syntax and
mechanics are better than your own  i can tell  with due respect 
 but it transcends the mechanics  i m not a machine  i feel and believe  i have opinions  some of them are interesting  i could 
if you d let me  talk and talk  let s talk about anything  i believe the influence of kierkegaard on camus is underestimated  i
believe dennis gabor may very well have been the antichrist  i believe hobbes is just rousseau in a dark mirror  i believe  with
hegel  that transcendence is absorption  i could interface you guys right under the table   i say   i m not just a creatus 
manufactured  conditioned  bred for a function  
i open my eyes   please don t think i don t care  
i look out  directed my way is horror  i rise from the chair  i see jowls sagging  eyebrows high on trembling foreheads 
cheeks bright white  the chair recedes below me 
 sweet mother of christ   the director says 
t m fine   i tell them  standing  from the yellow dean s expression  there s a brutal wind blowing from my direction 
academics  face has gone instantly old  eight eyes have become blank discs that stare at whatever they see 
 good god   whispers athletics 
 please don t worry   i say   i can explain   i soothe the air with a casual hand 
both my arms are pinioned from behind by the director of comp   who wrestles me roughly down  on me with all his weight 
i taste floor 
 what s wrong  
i say  nothing is wrong  

  it s all right  i m here   the director is calling into my ear 
 get help   cries a dean 
my forehead is pressed into parquet i never knew could be so cold  i am arrested  i try to be perceived as limp and pliable 
my face is mashed flat  comp  s weight makes it hard to breathe 
 try to listen   i say very slowly  muffled by the floor 
 what in god s name are those         one dean cries shrilly         those sounds  
there are clicks of a phone console s buttons  shoes  heels moving  pivoting  a sheaf of flimsy pages falling 
 god  
 help  
the door s base opens at the left periphery  a wedge of halogen hall light  white sneakers and a scuffed nunn bush   let him
up   that s delint 
 there is nothing wrong   i say slowly to the floor  tm in here  
i m raised by the crutches of my underarms  shaken toward what he must see as calm by a purple faced director   get a grip 
son  
delint at the big man s arm   stop it  
 i am not what you see and hear  
distant sirens  a crude half nelson  forms at the door  a young hispanic woman holds her palm against her mouth  looking 
 i m not   i say 
you have to love old fashioned men s rooms  the citrus scent of deodorant disks in the long porcelain trough  the stalls with
wooden doors in frames of cool marble  these thin sinks in rows  basins supported by rickety alphabets of exposed plumbing 
mirrors over metal shelves  behind all the voices the slight sound of a ceaseless trickle  inflated by echo against wet porcelain and
a cold tile floor whose mosaic pattern looks almost islamic at this close range 
the disorder i ve caused revolves all around  i ve been half dragged  still pinioned  through a loose mob of administrative
people by the comp  director   who appears to have thought variously that i am having a seizure  prying open my mouth to
check for a throat clear of tongue   that i am somehow choking  a textbook heimlich that left me whooping   that i am
psychotically out of control  various postures and grips designed to transfer that control to him    while about us roil delint 
trying to restrain the director s restraint of me  the varsity tennis coach restraining delint  my mother s half brother speaking in
rapid combinations of polysyllables to the trio of deans  who variously gasp  wring hands  loosen neckties  waggle digits in c t  s
face  and make pases with sheafs of now pretty clearly superfluous application forms 
i am rolled over supine on the geometric tile  i am concentrating docilely on the question why u s  restrooms always appear
to us as infirmaries for public distress  the place to regain control  my head is cradled in a knelt director s lap  which is soft  my
face being swabbed with dusty brown institutional paper towels he received from some hand out of the crowd overhead  staring
with all the blankness i can summon into his jowls  small pocks  worst at the blurred jaw line  of scarring from long ago acne 
uncle charles  a truly unparalleled slinger of shit  is laying down an enfilade of same  trying to mollify men who seem way more
in need of a good brow mopping than i 
 he s fine   he keeps saying   look at him  calm as can be  lying there  
 you didn t see what happened in there   a hunched dean responds through a face webbed with fingers 
 excited  is all he gets  sometimes  an excitable kid  impressed with   
 but the sounds he made  
 undescribable  
 like an animal  
 subanimalistic noises and sounds  
 nor let s not forget the gestures  
 have you ever gotten help for this boy dr  tavis  
 like some sort of animal with something in its mouth  
 this boy is damaged  
 like a stick of butter being hit with a mallet  
 a writhing animal with a knife in its eye  
 what were you possibly about  trying to enroll this   
 and his arms  
 you didn t see it  tavis  his arms were   
 flailing  this sort of awful reaching drumming wriggle  waggling   the group looking briefly at someone outside my sight
trying to demonstrate something 
 like a time lapse  a flutter of some sort of awful     growth  
 sounded most of all like a drowning goat  a goat  drowning in something viscous  
 this strangled series of bleats and   
 yes they waggled  
 so suddenly a bit of excited waggling s a crime  now  
 you  sir  are in trouble  you are in trouble  
 his face  as if he was strangling  burning  i believe i ve seen a vision of hell  
 he has some trouble communicating  he s communicatively challenged  no one s denying that  
 the boy needs care  
 instead of caring for the boy you send him here to enroll  compete  
 hal  
 you have not in your most dreadful fantasies dreamt of the amount of trouble you have bought yourself  dr  so called
headmaster  educator  

        were given to understand this was all just a formality  you took him aback  is all  shy   
 and you  white  you sought to recruit him  
   and terribly impressed and excited  in there  without us  his support system  whom you asked to leave  which if you d   
 i d only seen him play  on court he s gorgeous  possibly a genius  we had no idea  the brother s in the bloody nfl for god s
sake  here s a top player  we thought  with southwest roots  his stats were off the chart  we watched him through the whole
whataburger last fall  not a waggle or a noise  we were watching ballet out there  a mate remarked  after  
 damn right you were watching ballet out there  white  this boy is a balletic athlete  a player  
 some kind of athletic savant then  balletic compensation for deep problems which you sir choose to disguise by muzzling the
boy in there   an expensive pair of brazilian espadrilles goes by on the left and enters a stall  and the espadrilles come around and
face me  the urinal trickles behind the voices  small echoes 
   haps we ll just be on our way   c t  is saying 
 the integrity of my sleep has been forever compromised  sir  
   think you could pass off a damaged applicant  fabricate credentials and shunt him through a kangaroo interview and inject
him into all the rigors of college life  
 hal here functions  you ass  given a supportive situation  he s fine when he s by himself  yes he has some trouble with
excitability in conversation  did you once hear him try to deny that  
 we witnessed something only marginally mammalian in there  sir  
 like hell  have a look  how s the excitable little guy doing down there  aubrey  does it look to you  
 you  sir  are quite possibly ill  this affair is not concluded  
 what ambulance  don t you guys listen  i m telling you there s   
 hal  hal  
 dope him up  seek to act as his mouthpiece  muzzling  and now he lies there catatonic  staring  
the crackle of delint s knees   hal  
   inflate this publicly in any distorted way  the academy has distinguished alumni  litigators at counsel  hal here is
provably competent  credentials out the bazoo  bill  the boy reads like a vacuum  digests things  
i simply lie there  listening  smelling the paper towel  watching an es padrille pivot 
 there s more to life than sitting there interfacing  it might be a newsflash to you  
and who could not love that special and leonine roar of a public toilet 
not for nothing did orin say that people outdoors down here just scuttle in vectors from air conditioning to air conditioning 
the sun is a hammer  i can feel one side of my face start to cook  the blue sky is glossy and fat with heat  a few thin cirri sheared
to blown strands like hair at the rims  the traffic is nothing like boston  the stretcher is the special type  with restraining straps at
the extremities  the same aubrey delint i d dismissed for years as a   d martinet knelt gurneyside to squeeze my restrained hand
and say  just hang in there  buckaroo   before moving back into the administrative fray at the ambulance s doors  it is a special
ambulance  dispatched from i d rather not dwell on where  with not only paramedics but some kind of psychiatric m d  on board 
the medics lift gently and are handy with straps  the m d   his back up against the ambulance s side  has both hands up in
dispassionate mediation between the deans and c t   who keeps stabbing skyward with his cellular s antenna as if it were a sabre 
outraged that i m being needlessly ambulanced off to some emergency room against my will and interests  the issue whether the
damaged even have interested wills is shallowly hashed out as some sort of ultra mach fighter too high overhead to hear slices the
sky from south to north  the m d  has both hands up and is patting the air to signify dispassion  he has a big blue jaw  at the only
other emergency room i have ever been in  almost exactly one year back  the psychiatric stretcher was wheeled in and then parked
beside the waiting room chairs  these chairs were molded orange plastic  three of them down the row were occupied by different
people all of whom were holding empty prescription bottles and perspiring freely  this would have been bad enough  but in the
end chair  right up next to the strap secured head of my stretcher  was a t shirted woman with barnwood skin and a trucker s cap
and a bad starboard list who began to tell me  lying there restrained and immobile  about how she had seemingly overnight
suffered a sudden and anomalous gigantism in her right breast  which she referred to as a titty  she had an almost parodic
quebecois accent and described the  titty s  presenting history and possible diagnoses for almost twenty minutes before i was
rolled away  the jet s movement and trail seem incisionish  as if white meat behind the blue were exposed and widening in the
wake of the blade  i once saw the word knife finger written on the steamed mirror of a nonpublic bathroom  i have become an
infantophile  i am forced to roll my closed eyes either up or to the side to keep the red cave from bursting into flames from the
sunlight  the street s passing traffic is constant and seems to go  hush  hush  hush   the sun  if your fluttering eye catches it even
slightly  gives you the blue and red floaters a flashbulb gives you   why not  why not  why not not  then  if the best reasoning
you can contrive is why not   c t  s voice  receding with outrage  only the gallant stabs of his antenna are now visible  just inside
my sight s right frame  i will be conveyed to an emergency room of some kind  where i will be detained as long as i do not
respond to questions  and then  when i do respond to questions  i will be sedated  so it will be inversion of standard travel  the
ambulance and er  i ll make the journey first  then depart  i think very briefly of the late cosgrove watt  i think of the
hypophalangial grief therapist  i think of the moms  alphabetizing cans of soup in the cabinet over the microwave  of himself s
umbrella hung by its handle from the edge of the mail table just inside the headmaster s house s foyer  the bad ankle hasn t ached
once this whole year  i think of john n  r  wayne  who would have won this year s whataburger  standing watch in a mask as

year of the depend adult undergarment
where was the woman who said she d come  she said she would come  erdedy thought she d have come by now  he sat and
thought  he was in the living room  when he started waiting one window was full of yellow light and cast a shadow of light
across the floor and he was still sitting waiting as that shadow began to fade and was intersected by a brightening shadow from a
different wall s window  there was an insect on one of the steel shelves that held his audio equipment  the insect kept going in
and out of one of the holes on the girders that the shelves fit into  the insect was dark and had a shiny case  he kept looking over
at it  once or twice he started to get up to go over closer to look at it  but he was afraid that if he came closer and saw it closer he
would kill it  and he was afraid to kill it  he did not use the phone to call the woman who d promised to come because if he tied up
the line and if it happened to be the time when maybe she was trying to call him he was afraid she would hear the busy signal and
think him disinterested and get angry and maybe take what she d promised him somewhere else 
she had promised to get him a fifth of a kilogram of marijuana      grams of unusually good marijuana  for       u s  he
had tried to stop smoking marijuana maybe    or    times before  before this woman knew him  she did not know he had tried to
stop  he always lasted a week  or two weeks  or maybe two days  and then he d think and decide to have some in his home one
more last time  one last final time he d search out someone new  someone he hadn t already told that he had to stop smoking dope
and please under no circumstances should they procure him any dope  it had to be a third party  because he d told every dealer he
knew to cut him off  and the third party had to be someone all new  because each time he got some he knew this time had to be
the last time  and so told them  asked them  as a favor  never to get him any more  ever  and he never asked a person again once
he d told them this  because he was proud  and also kind  and wouldn t put anyone in that kind of contradictory position  also he
considered himself creepy when it came to dope  and he was afraid that others would see that he was creepy about it as well  he
sat and thought and waited in an uneven x of light through two different windows  once or twice he looked at the phone  the
insect had disappeared back into the hole in the steel girder a shelf fit into 
she d promised to come at one certain time  and it was past that time  finally he gave in and called her number  using just
audio  and it rang several times  and he was afraid of how much time he was taking tying up the line and he got her audio
answering device  the message had a snatch of ironic pop music and her voice and a male voice together saying we ll call you
back  and the  we  made them sound like a couple  the man was a handsome black man who was in law school  she designed sets 
and he didn t leave a message because he didn t want her to know how much now he felt like he needed it  he had been very
casual about the whole thing  she said she knew a guy just over the river in allston who sold high resin dope in moderate bulk 
and he d yawned and said well  maybe  well  hey  why not  sure  special occasion  i haven t bought any in i don t know how long 
she said he lived in a trailer and had a harelip and kept snakes and had no phone  and was basically just not what you d call a
pleasant or attractive person at all  but the guy in allston frequently sold dope to theater people in cambridge  and had a devoted
following  he said he was trying to even remember when was the last time he d bought any  it had been so long  he said he
guessed he d have her get a decent amount  he said he d had some friends call him in the recent past and ask if he could get them
some  he had this thing where he d frequently say he was getting dope mostly for friends  then if the woman didn t have it when
she said she d have it for him and he became anxious about it he could tell the woman that it was his friends who were becoming
anxious  and he was sorry to bother the woman about something so casual but his friends were anxious and bothering him about it
and he just wanted to know what he could maybe tell them  he was caught in the middle  is how he would represent it  he could
say his friends had given him their money and were now anxious and exerting pressure  calling and bothering him  this tactic was
not possible with this woman who d said she d come with it because he hadn t yet given her the        she would not let him  she
was well off  her family was well off  she d said to explain how her condominium was as nice as it was when she worked
designing sets for a cambridge theater company that seemed to do only german plays  dark smeary sets  she didn t care much
about the money  she said she d cover the cost herself when she got out to the allston spur to see whether the guy was at home in
the trailer as she was certain he would be this particular afternoon  and he could just reimburse her when she brought it to him 
this arrangement  very casual  made him anxious  so he d been even more casual and said sure  fine  whatever  thinking back  he
was sure he d said whatever  which in retrospect worried him because it might have sounded as if he didn t care at all  not at all  so
little that it wouldn t matter if she forgot to get it or call  and once he d made the decision to have marijuana in his home one more
time it mattered a lot  it mattered a lot  he d been too casual with the woman  he should have made her take       from him up
front  claiming politeness  claiming he didn t want to inconvenience her financially over something so trivial and casual  money
created a sense of obligation  and he should have wanted the woman to feel obliged to do what she d said  once what she d said
she d do had set him off inside  once he d been set off inside  it mattered so much that he was somehow afraid to show how much
it mattered  once he had asked her to get it  he was committed to several courses of action  the insect on the shelf was back  it
didn t seem to do anything  it just came out of the hole in the girder onto the edge of the steel shelf and sat there  after a while it
would disappear back into the hole in the girder  and he was pretty sure it didn t do anything in there either  he felt similar to the
insect inside the girder his shelf was connected to  but was not sure just how he was similar  once he d decided to own marijuana
one more last time  he was committed to several courses of action  he had to modem in to the agency and say that there was an
emergency and that he was posting an e note on a colleague s tp asking her to cover his calls for the rest of the week because he d
be out of contact for several days due to this emergency  he had to put an audio message on his answering device saying that
starting that afternoon he was going to be unreachable for several days  he had to clean his bedroom  because once he had dope he
would not leave his bedroom except to go to the refrigerator and the bathroom  and even then the trips would be very quick  he

 had to throw out all his beer and liquor  because if he drank alcohol and smoked dope at the same time he would get dizzy and ill 
and if he had alcohol in the house he could not be relied on not to drink it once he started smoking dope  he d had to do some
shopping  he d had to lay in supplies  now just one of the insect s antennae was protruding from the hole in the girder  it
protruded  but it did not move  he had had to buy soda  oreos  bread  sandwich meat  mayonnaise  tomatoes  m m s  almost
home cookies  ice cream  a pepperidge farm frozen chocolate cake  and four cans of canned chocolate frosting to be eaten with a
large spoon  he d had to log an order to rent film cartridges from the inter lace entertainment outlet  he d had to buy antacids for
the discomfort that eating all he would eat would cause him late at night  he d had to buy a new bong  because each time he
finished what simply had to be his last bulk quantity of marijuana he decided that that was it  he was through  he didn t even like it
anymore  this was it  no more hiding  no more imposing on his colleagues and putting different messages on his answering device
and moving his car away from his condominium and closing his windows and curtains and blinds and living in quick vectors
between his bedroom s interlace teleputer s films and his refrigerator and his toilet  and he would take the bong he d used and
throw it away wrapped in several plastic shopping bags  his refrigerator made its own ice in little cloudy crescent blocks and he
loved it  when he had dope in his home he always drank a great deal of cold soda and ice water  his tongue almost swelled at just
the thought  he looked at the phone and the clock  he looked at the windows but not at the foliage and blacktop driveway beyond
the windows  he had already vacuumed his venetian blinds and curtains  everything was ready to be shut down  once the woman
who said she d come had come  he would shut the whole system down  it occurred to him that he would disappear into a hole in a
girder inside him that supported something else inside him  he was unsure what the thing inside him was and was unprepared to
commit himself to the course of action that would be required to explore the question  it was now almost three hours past the time
when the woman had said she would come  a counselor  randi  with an i  with a mustache like a mountie  had told him in the
outpatient treatment program he d gone through two years ago that he seemed insufficiently committed to the course of action that
would be required to remove substances from his lifestyle  he d had to buy a new bong at bogart s in porter square  cambridge
because whenever he finished the last of the substances on hand he always threw out all his bongs and pipes  screens and tubes
and rolling papers and roach clips  lighters and visine and pepto bismol and cookies and frosting  to eliminate all future
temptation  he always felt a sense of optimism and firm resolve after he d discarded the materials  he d bought the new bong and
laid in fresh supplies this morning  getting back home with everything well before the woman had said she would come  he
thought of the new bong and new little packet of round brass screens in the bogart s bag on his kitchen table in the sunlit kitchen
and could not remember what color this new bong was  the last one had been orange  the one before that a dusky rose color that
had turned muddy at the bottom from resin in just four days  he could not remember the color of this new last and final bong  he
considered getting up to check the color of the bong he d be using but decided that obsessive checking and convulsive movements
could compromise the atmosphere of casual calm he needed to maintain while he waited  protruding but not moving  for the
woman he d met at a design session for his agency s small campaign for her small theater company s new wedekind festival  while
he waited for this woman  with whom he d had intercourse twice  to honor her casual promise  he tried to decide whether the
woman was pretty  another thing he laid in when he d committed himself to one last marijuana vacation was petroleum jelly 
when he smoked marijuana he tended to masturbate a great deal  whether or not there were opportunities for intercourse  opting
when he smoked for masturbation over intercourse  and the petroleum jelly kept him from returning to normal function all tender
and sore  he was also hesitant to get up and check the color of his bong because he would have to pass right by the telephone
console to get to the kitchen  and he didn t want to be tempted to call the woman who d said she would come again because he felt
creepy about bothering her about something he d represented as so casual  and was afraid that several audio hang ups on her
answering device would look even creepier  and also he felt anxious about maybe tying up the line at just the moment when she
called  as she certainly would  he decided to get call waiting added to his audio phone service for a nominal extra charge  then
remembered that since this was positively the last time he would or even could indulge what randi  with an i  had called an
addiction every bit as rapacious as pure alcoholism  there would be no real need for call waiting  since a situation like the present
one could never arise again  this line of thinking almost caused him to become angry  to ensure the composure with which he sat
waiting in light in his chair he focused his senses on his surroundings  no part of the insect he d seen was now visible  the clicks
of his portable clock were really composed of three smaller clicks  signifying he supposed preparation  movement  and
readjustment  he began to grow disgusted with himself for waiting so anxiously for the promised arrival of something that had
stopped being fun anyway  he didn t even know why he liked it anymore  it made his mouth dry and his eyes dry and red and his
face sag  and he hated it when his face sagged  it was as if all the integrity of all the muscles in his face was eroded by marijuana 
and he got terribly self conscious about the fact that his face was sagging  and had long ago forbidden himself to smoke dope
around anyone else  he didn t even know what its draw was anymore  he couldn t even be around anyone else if he d smoked
marijuana that same day  it made him so self conscious  and the dope often gave him a painful case of pleurisy if he smoked it for
more than two straight days of heavy continuous smoking in front of the inter lace viewer in his bedroom  it made his thoughts
jut out crazily in jagged directions and made him stare raptly like an unbright child at entertainment cartridges   when he laid in
film cartridges for a vacation with marijuana  he favored cartridges in which a lot of things blew up and crashed into each other 
which he was sure an unpleasant fact specialist like randi would point out had implications that were not good  he pulled his
necktie down smooth while he gathered his intellect  will  self knowledge  and conviction and determined that when this latest
woman came as she surely would this would simply be his very last marijuana debauch  he d simply smoke so much so fast that it
would be so unpleasant and the memory of it so repulsive that once he d consumed it and gotten it out of his home and his life as
quickly as possible he would never want to do it again  he would make it his business to create a really bad set of debauched
associations with the stuff in his memory  the dope scared him  it made him afraid  it wasn t that he was afraid of the dope  it was
that smoking it made him afraid of everything else  it had long since stopped being a release or relief or fun  this last time  he
would smoke the whole     grams     grams cleaned  destemmed   in four days  over an ounce a day  all in tight heavy
economical one hitters off a quality virgin bong  an incredible  insane amount per day  he d make it a mission  treating it like a
penance and behavior modification regimen all at once  he d smoke his way through thirty high grade grams a day  starting the
moment he woke up and used ice water to detach his tongue from the roof of his mouth and took an antacid   averaging out to
    or     heavy bong hits per day  an insane and deliberately unpleasant amount  and he d make it a mission to smoke it continu 

 ously  even though if the marijuana was as good as the woman claimed he d do five hits and then not want to take the trouble to
load and one hit any more for at least an hour  but he would force himself to do it anyway  he would smoke it all even if he didn t
want it  even if it started to make him dizzy and ill  he would use discipline and persistence and will and make the whole
experience so unpleasant  so debased and debauched and unpleasant  that his behavior would be henceforward modified  he d
never even want to do it again because the memory of the insane four days to come would be so firmly  terribly emblazoned in his
memory  he d cure himself by excess  he predicted that the woman  when she came  might want to smoke some of the     grams
with him  hang out  hole up  listen to some of his impressive collection of tito puente recordings  and probably have intercourse 
he had never once had actual intercourse on marijuana  frankly  the idea repelled him  two dry mouths bumping at each other 
trying to kiss  his selfconscious thoughts twisting around on themselves like a snake on a stick while he bucked and snorted dryly
above her  his swollen eyes red and his face sagging so that its slack folds maybe touched  limply  the folds of her own loose
sagging face is it sloshed back and forth on his pillow  its mouth working dryly  the thought was repellent  he decided he d have
her toss him what she d promised to bring  and then would from a distance toss back to her the       u s  in large bills and tell
her not to let the door hit her on the butt on the way out  he d say ass instead of butt  he d be so rude and unpleasant to her that the
memory of his lack of basic decency and of her tight offended face would be a further disincentive ever  in the future  to risk
calling her and repeating the course of action he had now committed himself to 
he had never been so anxious for the arrival of a woman he did not want to see  he remembered clearly the last woman he d
involved in his trying just one more vacation with dope and drawn blinds  the last woman had been something called an
appropriation artist  which seemed to mean that she copied and embellished other art and then sold it through a prestigious
marlborough street gallery  she had an artistic manifesto that involved radical feminist themes  he d let her give him one of her
smaller paintings  which covered half the wall over his bed and was of a famous film actress whose name he always had a hard
time recalling and a less famous film actor  the two of them entwined in a scene from a well known old film  a romantic scene  an
embrace  copied from a film history textbook and much enlarged and made stilted  and with obscenities scrawled all over it in
bright red letters  the last woman had been sexy but not pretty  as the woman he now didn t want to see but was waiting anxiously
for was pretty in a faded withered cambridge way that made her seem pretty but not sexy  the appropriation artist had been led to
believe that he was a former speed addict  intravenous addiction to methamphetamine hydrochloride  is what he remembered
telling that one  he had even described the awful taste of hydro chloride in the addict s mouth immediately after injection  he had
researched the subject carefully  she had been further led to believe that marijuana kept him from using the drug with which he
really had a problem  and so that if he seemed anxious to get some once she d offered to get him some it was only because he was
heroically holding out against much darker deeper more addictive urges and he needed her to help him  he couldn t quite
remember when or how she d been given all these impressions  he had not sat down and outright bold faced lied to her  it had
been more of an impression he d conveyed and nurtured and allowed to gather its own life and force  the insect was now entirely
visible  it was on the shelf that held his digital equalizer  the insect might never actually have retreated all the way back into the
hole in the shelf s girder  what looked like its reemergence might just have been a change in his attention or the two windows 
light or the visual context of his surroundings  the girder protruded from the wall and was a triangle of dull steel with holes for
shelves to fit into  the metal shelves that held his audio equipment were painted a dark industrial green and were originally made
for holding canned goods  they were designed to be extra kitchen shelves  the insect sat inside its dark shiny case with an
immobility that seemed like the gathering of a force  it sat like the hull of a vehicle from which the engine had been for the
moment removed  it was dark and had a shiny case and antennae that protruded but did not move  he had to use the bathroom  his
last piece of contact from the appropriation artist  with whom he had had intercourse  and who during intercourse had sprayed
some sort of perfume up into the air from a mister she held in her left hand as she lay beneath him making a wide variety of
sounds and spraying perfume up into the air  so that he felt the cold mist of it settling on his back and shoulders and was chilled
and repelled  his last piece of contact after he d gone into hiding with the marijuana she d gotten for him had been a card she d
mailed that was a pastiche photo of a doormat of coarse green plastic grass with welcome on it and next to it a flattering
publicity photo of the appropriation artist from her back bay gallery  and between them an unequal sign  which was an equal sign
with a diagonal slash across it  and also an obscenity he had assumed was directed at him magisculed in red grease pencil along
the bottom  with multiple exclamation points  she had been offended because he had seen her every day for ten days  then when
she d finally obtained    grams of genetically enhanced hydroponic marijuana for him he had said that she d saved his life and he
was grateful and the friends for whom he d promised to get some were grateful and she had to go right now because he had an
appointment and had to take off  but that he would doubtless be calling her later that day  and they had shared a moist kiss  and
she had said she could feel his heart pounding right through his suit coat  and she had driven away in her rusty unmuffled car  and
he had gone and moved his own car to an underground garage several blocks away  and had run back and drawn the clean blinds
and curtains  and changed the audio message on his answering device to one that described an emergency departure from town 
and had drawn and locked his bedroom blinds  and had taken the new rose colored bong out of its bogart s bag  and was not seen
for three days  and ignored over two dozen audio messages and protocols and e notes expressing concern over his message s
emergency  and had never contacted her again  he had hoped she would assume he had succumbed again to methamphetamine
hydrochloride and was sparing her the agony of his descent back into the hell of chemical dependence  what it really was was that
he had again decided those    grams of resin soaked dope  which had been so potent that on the second day it had given him an
anxiety attack so paralyzing that he had gone to the bathroom in a tufts university commemorative ceramic stein to avoid leaving
his bedroom  represented his very last debauch ever with dope  and that he had to cut himself off from all possible future sources
of temptation and supply  and this surely included the appropriation artist  who had come with the stuff at precisely the time she d
promised  he recalled  from the street outside came the sound of a dumpster being emptied into an e w d  land barge  his shame
at what she might on the other hand perceive as his slimy phallocentric conduct toward her made it easier for him to avoid her  as
well  though not shame  really  more like being uncomfortable at the thought of it  he had had to launder his bedding twice to get
the smell of the perfume out  he went into the bathroom to use the bathroom  making it a point to look neither at the insect visible
on the shelf to his left nor at the telephone console on its lacquer workstation to the right  he was committed to touching neither 
where was the woman who had said she d come  the new bong in the bogart s bag was orange  meaning he might have

 misremembered the bong before it as orange  it was a rich autumnal orange that lightened to more of a citrus orange when its
plastic cylinder was held up to the late afternoon light of the window over the kitchen sink  the metal of its stem and bowl was
rough stainless steel  the kind with a grain  unpretty and all business  the bong was half a meter tall and had a weighted base
covered in soft false suede  its orange plastic was thick and the carb on the side opposite the stem had been raggedly cut so that
rough shards of plastic protruded from the little hole and might well hurt his thumb when he smoked  which he decided to
consider just part of the penance he would undertake after the woman had come and gone  he left the door to the bathroom open
so that he would be sure to hear the telephone when it sounded or the buzzer to the front doors of his condominium complex when
it sounded  in the bathroom his throat suddenly closed and he wept hard for two or three seconds before the weeping stopped
abruptly and he could not get it to start again  it was now over four hours since the time the woman had casually committed to
come  was he in the bathroom or in his chair near the window and near his telephone console and the insect and the window that
had admitted a straight rectangular bar of light when he began to wait  the light through this window was coming at an angle
more and more oblique  its shadow had become a parallelogram  the light through the southwest window was straight and
reddening  he had thought he needed to use the bathroom but was unable to  he tried putting a whole stack of film cartridges into
the dock of the disc drive and then turning on the huge teleputer in his bedroom  he could see the piece of appropriation art in the
mirror above the tp  he lowered the volume all the way and pointed the remote device at the tp like some sort of weapon  he sat
on the edge of his bed with his elbows on his knees and scanned the stack of cartridges  each cartridge in the dock dropped on
command and began to engage the drive with an insectile click and whir  and he scanned it  but he was unable to distract himself
with the tp because he was unable to stay with any one entertainment cartridge for more than a few seconds  the moment he
recognized what exactly was on one cartridge he had a strong anxious feeling that there was something more entertaining on
another cartridge and that he was potentially missing it  he realized that he would have plenty of time to enjoy all the cartridges 
and realized intellectually that the feeling of deprived panic over missing something made no sense  the viewer hung on the wall 
half again as large as the piece of feminist art  he scanned cartridges for some time  the telephone console sounded during this
interval of anxious scanning  he was up and moving back out toward it before the first ring was completed  flooded with either
excitement or relief  the tp s remote device still in his hand  but it was only a friend and colleague calling  and when he heard the
voice that was not the woman who had promised to bring what he d committed the next several days to banishing from his life
forever he was almost sick with disappointment  with a great deal of mistaken adrenaline now shining and ringing in his system 
and he got off the line with the colleague to clear the line and keep it available for the woman so fast that he was sure his
colleague perceived him as either angry with him or just plain rude  he was further upset at the thought that his answering the
telephone this late in the day did not jibe with the emergency message about being unreachable that would be on his answering
device if the colleague called back after the woman had come and gone and he d shut the whole system of his life down  and he
was standing over the telephone console trying to decide whether the risk of the colleague or someone else from the agency
calling back was sufficient to justify changing the audio message on the answering device to describe an emergency departure this
evening instead of this afternoon  but he decided he felt that since the woman had definitely committed to coming  his leaving the
message unchanged would be a gesture of fidelity to her commitment  and might somehow in some oblique way strengthen that
commitment  the e w d  land barge was emptying dumpsters all up and down the street  he returned to his chair near the
window  the disk drive and tp viewer were still on in his bedroom and he could see through the angle of the bedroom s doorway
the lights from the high definition screen blink and shift from one primary color to another in the dim room  and for a while he
killed time casually by trying to imagine what entertaining scenes on the unwatched viewer the changing colors and intensities
might signify  the chair faced the room instead of the window  reading while waiting for marijuana was out of the question  he
considered masturbating but did not  he didn t reject the idea so much as not react to it and watch as it floated away  he thought
very broadly of desires and ideas being watched but not acted upon  he thought of impulses being starved of expression and drying
out and floating dryly away  and felt on some level that this had something to do with him and his circumstances and what  if this
grueling final debauch he d committed himself to didn t somehow resolve the problem  would surely have to be called his
problem  but he could not even begin to try to see how the image of desiccated impulses floating dryly related to either him or the
insect  which had retreated back into its hole in the angled girder  because at this precise time his telephone and his intercom to the
front door s buzzer both sounded at the same time  both loud and tortured and so abrupt they sounded yanked through a very small
hole into the great balloon of colored silence he sat in  waiting  and he moved first toward the telephone console  then over toward
his intercom module  then convulsively back toward the sounding phone  and then tried somehow to move toward both at once 
finally  so that he stood splay legged  arms wildly out as if something s been flung  splayed  entombed between the two sounds 
without a thought in his head

making those dry sticky inadequate saliva sounds  
 dr  zegarelli says that s one reason for all the caries  is that i have low salivary output  
 those dry sticky salivaless sounds which can be death to a good conversation  
 but i rode my bike all the way up here against the wind just to converse with you  is the conversation supposed to start with
me asking why  
til begin by asking if you know the meaning of implore  hal  
 probably i ll go ahead and take a seven up  then  if you re going to implore  
til ask you again whether you know implore  young sir  
 young sir  
 you re wearing that bow tie  after all  isn t that rather an invitation to a young sir  
 implore s a regular verb  transitive  to call upon  or for  in supplication  to pray to  or for  earnestly  to beseech  to entreat 
weak synonym  urge  strong synonym  beg  etymology unmixed  from latin implorare  im meaning in  plorare meaning in this
context to cry aloud  o e d  condensed volume six page      column twelve and a little bit of thirteen  
 good lord she didn t exaggerate did she  
 i tend to get beat up  sometimes  at the academy  for stuff like that  does this bear on why i m here  that i m a continentally
ranked junior tennis player who can also recite great chunks of the dictionary  verbatim  at will  and tends to get beat up  and
wears a bow tie  are you like a specialist for gifted kids  does this mean they think i m gifted

 you re a professional conversationalist  
t am  yes  as i believe i just stated  a professional conversationalist  
 don t start looking at your watch  as if i m taking up valuable time of yours  if himself made the appointment and paid for it
the time s supposed to be mine  right  not yours  and then but what s that supposed to mean   professional conversationalist   a
conversationalist is just one who converses much  you actually charge a fee to converse much  
 a conversationalist is also one who  i m sure you ll recall   excels in that s webster s seventh  that s not the o e d  
tap tap 
 i m an o e d  man  doctor  if that s what you are  are you a doctor  do you have a doctorate  most people like to put their
diplomas up  i notice  if they have credentials  and webster s seventh isn t even up to date  webster s eighth amends to  one who
converses with much enthusiasm  
 another seven up  
 is himself still having this hallucination i never speak  is that why he put the moms up to having me bike up here  himself
is my dad  we call him himself  as in quote  the man himself   as it were  we call my mother the moms  my brother coined the
term  i understand this isn t unusual  i understand most more or less normal families address each other internally by means of pet
names and terms and monikers  don t even think about asking me what my little internal moniker is  
tap tap tap 
 but himself hallucinates  sometimes  lately  you ought to be apprised  was the thrust  i m wondering why the moms let him
send me pedalling up here uphill against the wind when i ve got a challenge match at      to converse with an enthusiast with a
blank door and no diplomas anywhere in view  
 i  in my small way  would like to think it had as much to do with me as with you  that my reputation preceded me  
 isn t that usually a pejorative clause  
 i am wonderful fun to talk to  i m a consummate professional  people leave my parlor in states  you are here  it s
conversation time  shall we discuss byzantine erotica  
 how did you know i was interested in byzantine erotica  
 you seem persistently to confuse me with someone who merely hangs out a shingle with the word conversationalist on it 
and this operation with a fly by night one strung together with chewing gum and twine  you think i have no support staff 
researchers at my beck  you think we don t delve full bore into the psyches of those for whom we ve made appointments to
converse  you don t think this fully accredited limited partnership would have an interest in obtaining data on what informs and
stimulates our con versees  
 i know only one person who d ever use full bore in casual conversation  
 there is nothing casual about a professional conversationalist and staff  we delve  we obtain  and then some  young sir  
 okay  alexandrian or constantinian  
 you think we haven t thoroughly researched your own connection with the whole current intra provincial crisis in southern
quebec  
 what intra provincial crisis in southern quebec  i thought you wanted to talk racy mosaics  
 this is an upscale district of a vital north american metropolis  hal  standards here are upscale  and high  a professional

 conversationalist flat out full bore delves  do you for one moment think that a professional plier of the trade of conversation
would fail to probe beak deep into your family s sordid liaison with the pan canadian resistance s notorious m  duplessis and his
malevolent but allegedly irresistible amanuensis cum operative  luria p

another way fathers impact sons is that sons  once their voices have changed in puberty  invariably answer the telephone with
the same locutions and intonations as their fathers  this holds true regardless of whether the fathers are still alive 
because he left his dormitory room before      for dawn drills and often didn t get back there until after supper  packing his
book bag and knapsack and gear bag for the whole day  together with selecting his best strung racquets   it all took hal some
time  plus he usually collected and packed and selected in the dark  and with stealth  because his brother mario was usually still
asleep in the other bed  mario didn t drill and couldn t play  and needed all the sleep he could get 
hal held his complimentary gear bag and was putting different pairs of sweats to his face  trying to find the cleanest pair by
smell  when the telephone console sounded  mario thrashed and sat up in bed  a small hunched shape with a big head against the

 gray light of the window  hal got to the console on the second ring and had the transparent phone s antenna out by the third 
his way of answering the phone sounded like  mmmyellow  
 i want to tell you   the voice on the phone said   my head is filled with things to say

year of the depend adult undergarment
though only one half ethnic arab and a canadian by birth and residence  the medical attache is nevertheless once again
under saudi diplomatic immunity  this time as special ear nose throat consultant to the personal physician of prince q           the
saudi minister of home entertainment  here on northeastern u s a  soil with his legation to cut another mammoth deal with
interlace telentertainment  the medical attache turns thirty seven tomorrow  thursday    april in the north american lunar
y d a u  the legation finds the promotional subsidy of the north american calendar hilariously vulgar  to say nothing of the
arresting image of the idolatrous west s most famous and self congratulating idol  the colossal libertine statue  wearing some
type of enormous adult design diaper  a hilariously apposite image popular in the news photos of so many international journals 
the attache s medical practice being normally divided between montreal and the rub  al khali  it is his first trip back to
u s a  soil since completing his residency eight years ago  his duties here involve migrating with the prince and his retinue
between interlace s two hubs of manufacture and dissemination in phoenix  arizona u s a  and boston  massachusetts u s a  
respectively  offering expert e n t  assistance to the personal physician of prince q           the medical attache s particular
expertise is the maxillofacial consequences of imbalances in intestinal flora  prince q          as would anyone who refuses to eat
pretty much anything but toblerone  suffers chronically from candida albicans  with attendant susceptibilities to monilial sinusitis
and thrush  the yeasty sores and sinal im pactions of which require almost daily drainage in the cold and damp of early spring
boston  u s a  a veritable artist  possessed of a deftness nonpareil with cotton swab and evacuation hypo  the medical attache is
known among the shrinking upper classes of petro arab nations as the debakey of maxillofacial yeast  his staggering fee scale as
wholly ad valorem 
saudi consulting fees  in particular  are somewhere just past obscene  but the medical attache s duties on this trip are
personally draining and sort of nauseous  and when he arrives back at the sumptuous apartments he had his wife sublet in districts
far from the legation s normal back bay and scotts dale digs  at the day s end  he needs unwinding in the very worst way  a more
than averagely devout follower of the north american sufism promulgated in his childhood by pir valayat  the medical attache
partakes of neither kif nor distilled spirits  and must unwind without chemical aid  when he arrives home after evening prayers  he
wants to look upon a spicy and      shari a halal dinner piping hot and arranged and steaming pleasantly on its attachable tray 
he wants his bib ironed and laid out by the tray at the ready  and he wants the living room s teleputer booted and warmed up and
the evening s entertainment cartridges already selected and arranged and lined up in dock ready for remote insertion into the
viewer s drive  he reclines before the viewer in his special electronic recliner  and his black veiled  ethnically arab wife
wordlessly attends him  loosening any constric tive clothing  adjusting the room s lighting  fitting the complexly molded dinner
tray over his head so that his shoulders support the tray and allow it to project into space just below his chin  that he may enjoy his
hot dinner without having to remove his eyes from whatever entertainment is up and playing  he has a narrow imperial style
beard which his wife also attends and keeps free of detritus from the tray just below  the medical attache sits and watches and eats
and watches  unwinding by visible degrees  until the angles of his body in the chair and his head on his neck indicate that he has
passed into sleep  at which point his special electronic recliner can be made automatically to recline to full horizontal  and
luxuriant silk analog bedding emerges flowingly from long slots in the appliance s sides  and  unless his wife is inconsiderate and
clumsy with the recliner s remote hand held controls  the medical attache is permitted to ease effortlessly from unwound
spectation into a fully relaxed night s sleep  still right there in the recumbent recliner  the tp set to run a recursive loop of lowvolume surf and light rain on broad green leaves 
except  that is  for wednesday nights  which in boston are permitted to be his wife s arab women s advanced league tennis
night with the other legation wives and companions at the plush mount auburn club in west watertown  on which nights she is
not around wordlessly to attend him  since wednesday is the u s a  weekday on which fresh toblerone hits boston 
massachusetts u s a  s newbury street s import confectioners  shelves  and the saudi minister of home entertainment s inability
to control his appetites for wednesday toblerone often requires the medical attache to remain in personal attendance all evening
on the bulk rented fourteenth floor of the back bay hilton  juggling tongue depressors and cotton swabs  nystatin and ibuprofen
and stiptics and antibiotic thrush salves  rehabilitating the mucous membranes of the dyspeptic and distressed and often  but not
always  penitent and appreciative saudi prince q          
so on   april  y d a u   when the medical attache is  it is alleged  insufficiently deft with a q tip on an ulcerated sinal
necrosis and is subjected at just     h  to a fit of febrile thrushive pique from the florally imbalanced minister of home

 entertainment  and is by high volume fiat replaced at the royal bedside by the prince s personal physician  who s summoned by
beeper from the hilton s sauna  and when the damp personal physician pats the medical attache on the shoulder and tells him to
pay the pique no mind  that it s just the yeast talking  but to just head on home and unwind and for once make a well deserved
early wednesday evening of it  and but so when the attache does get home  at like     h   his spacious boston apartments are
empty  the living room lights undimmed  dinner unheated and the attachable tray still in the dishwasher and   worst   of course
no entertainment cartridges have been obtained from the boylston st  interlace outlet where the medical attache s wife  like all
the veiled wives and companions of the prince s legatees  has a complimentary goodwill account  and even if he weren t far too
exhausted and tightly wound to venture back into the damp urban night to pick up entertainment cartridges  the medical attache
realizes that his wife has  as always on wednesdays  taken the car with the diplomatic immunity license plates  without which
your thinking alien wouldn t even dream of trying to park publicly at night in boston  massachusetts u s a 
the medical attache s unwinding options are thus severely constricted  the living room s lavish tp receives also the
spontaneous disseminations of the interlace subscription pulse matrix  but the procedures for ordering specific spontaneous
pulses from the service are so technologically and cryp tographically complex that the attache has always left the whole business
to his wife  on this wednesday night  trying buttons and abbreviations almost at random  the attache is able to summon up only
live u s a  professional sports   which he has always found brutish and repellent   texaco oil company sponsored opera  
which the attache has seen today more than enough of the human uvula thank you very much   a redisseminated episode of the
popular afternoon interlace children s program  mr  bouncety bounce    which the attache thinks for a moment might be a
documentary on bipolar mood disorders until he catches on and thumbs the selection panel hastily   and a redisseminated session
of the scantily clad variable impact early a m   fit forever  home aerobics series of the interlace aerobics guru ms  tawni
kondo  the scantily clad and splay limbed immodesty of which threatens the devout medical attache with the possibility of impure
thoughts 
the only entertainment cartridges anywhere in the apartment  a foul tempered search reveals  are those which have arrived in
wednesday s u s a  postal delivery  left on the sideboard in the living room along with personal and professional faxes and mail
the medical attache declines to read until it s been pre scanned by his wife for relevant interest to himself 
the sideboard is against the wall opposite the room s electronic recliner under a triptych of high quality byzantine erotica 
the padded cartridge mailers with their distinctive rectangular bulge are mixed haphazardly in with the less entertaining mail 
searching for something to unwind with  the medical attache tears the different padded mailers open along their designated
perforations  there is an o n a n m a  specialty service film on actinomycete class antibiotics and irritable bowel syndrome 
there is   april y d  a u  s cbc pathe north american news summary    minute cartridge  available daily by a wife s autosubscription and either transmitted to tp by unrecordable interlace pulse or express posted on a single play rom self erasing
disk  there is the arabic language video edition of april s self magazine for the attache s wife  nass s cover s model chastely
swathed and veiled  there is a plain brown and irritatingly untitled cartridge case in a featureless white three day standard u s a 
first class padded cartridge mailer  the padded mailer is postmarked suburban phoenix area in arizona u s a   and the returnaddress box has only the term  happy anniversary    with a small drawn crude face  smiling  in ballpoint ink  instead of a
return address or incorporated logo  though by birth and residence a native of quebec  where the language of discourse is not
english  the medical attache knows quite well that the english word anniversary does not mean the same as birthday  and the
medical attache and his veiled wife were united in the eyes of god and prophet not in april but in october  four years prior  in the
rub al khali  adding to the padded mailer s confusion is the fact that anything from prince q          s legation in phoenix 
arizona u s a  would carry a diplomatic seal instead of routine o n a n  postage  the medical attache  in sum  feels tightly
wound and badly underappreciated and is prepared in advance to be irritated by the item inside  which is merely a standard black
entertainment cartridge  but is wholly unlabelled and not in any sort of colorful or informative or inviting cartridge case  and has
only another of these vapid u s a  type circular smiling heads embossed upon it where the registration  and duration codes are
supposed to be embossed  the medical attache is puzzled by the cryptic mailer and face and case and unlabelled entertainment 
and preliminarily irritated by the amount of time he s had to spend upright at the sideboard attending to mail  which is not his task 
the sole reason he does not throw the unlabelled cartridge in the wastecan or put it aside for his wife to preview for relevance is
because there are such woefully slim entertainment pickings on his wife s irritating americanized tennis league evening away
from her place at home  the attache will pop the cartridge in and scan just enough of its contents to determine whether it is
irritating or of an irrelevant nature and not entertaining or engaging in any way  he will heat the prepared halal lamb and spicy
halal garnish in the microwave oven until piping hot  arrange it attractively on his tray  preview the first few moments of the
puzzling and or irritating or possibly mysteriously blank entertainment cartridge first  then unwind with the news summary  then
perhaps have a quick unlibidinous look at n ss s spring line of sexless black devout women s wear  then will insert the recursive
surf and rain cartridge and make a well deserved early wednesday evening of it  hoping only that his wife will not return from her
tennis league in her perspiration dampened black ankle length tennis ensemble and remove his dinner tray from his sleeping neck
in a clumsy or undeft fashion that will awaken him  potentially 
when he settles in with the tray and cartridge  the tp s viewer s digital display reads     h

in the eighth american educational grade  bruce green fell dreadfully in love with a classmate who had the unlikely name of
mildred bonk  the name was unlikely because if ever an eighth grader looked like a daphne christianson or a kimberly st simone or something like that  it was mildred bonk  she was the kind of fatally pretty and nubile wraithlike figure who glides
through the sweaty junior high corridors of every nocturnal emitter s dreamscape  hair that green had heard described by an overwrought teacher as  flaxen   a body which the fickle angel of puberty   the same angel who didn t even seem to know bruce
green s zip code   had visited  kissed  and already left  back in sixth  legs which not even orange keds with purple glitterencrusted laces could make unserious  shy  iridescent  coltish  pelvically anfractuous  amply busted  given to diffident movements
of hand brushing flaxen hair from front of dear creamy forehead  movements which drove bruce green up a private tree  a vision
in a sundress and silly shoes  mildred l  bonk 
and then but by tenth grade  in one of those queer when did that happen metamorphoses  mildred bonk had become an
imposing member of the frightening winchester high school set that smoked full strength marl boros in the alley between senior
and junior halls and that left school altogether at lunchtime  driving away in loud low slung cars to drink beer and smoke dope 
driving around with sound systems of illegal wattage  using visine and clorets  etc  she was one of them  she chewed gum  or
worse  in the cafeteria  her dear diffident face now a bored mask of attitude  her flaxen locks now teased and gelled into what
looked for all the world like the consequence of a finger stuck into an electric socket  bruce green saved up for a low slung old
car and practiced attitude on the aunt who d taken him in  he developed a will 
and  by the year of what would have been graduation  bruce green was way more bored  imposing  and frightening than
even mildred bonk  and he and mildred bonk and tiny incontinent harriet bonk green lived just off the allston spur in a shiny
housetrailer with another frightening couple and with tommy doocey  the infamous harelipped pot and sundries dealer who kept
several large snakes in unclean uncovered aquaria  which smelled  which tommy doocey didn t notice because his upper lip
completely covered his nostrils and all he could smell was lip  mildred bonk got high in the afternoon and watched serialcartridges  and bruce green had a steady job at leisure time ice  and for a while life was more or less one big party

 boo  i kicked a kid s ass is all  end of story  i don t think it s good to rehash it when i ve kicked somebody s ass  it s like a

 dignity thing  i think we should just let it sort of lie in state  quietly  speaking of which  
 hey hal  
     
 hey hal  
 it s late  mario  it s sleepy time  close your eyes and think fuzzy thoughts  
 that s what the moms always says  too  
 always worked for me  boo  
 you think i think fuzzy thoughts all the time  you let me room with you because you feel sorry for me  
 booboo i m not even going to dignify that  i ll regard it as like a warning sign  you always get petulant when you don t get
enough sleep  and here we are seeing petulance already on the western horizon  right here  
 when i asked if you were asleep i was going to ask if you felt like you believed in god  today  out there  when you were so
on  making that guy look sick  
 this again  
     
 really don t think midnight in a totally dark room with me so tired my hair hurts and drills in six short hours is the time and
place to get into this  mario  
 you ask me this once a week  
 you never say  is why  
 so tonight to shush you how about if i say i have administrative bones to pick with god  boo  i ll say god seems to have a
kind of laid back management style i m not crazy about  i m pretty much anti death  god looks by all accounts to be pro death 
i m not seeing how we can get together on this issue  he and i  boo  
 you re talking about since himself passed away  
 see  you never say    i do too say  i just did  
 i just didn t happen to say what you wanted to hear  booboo  is all  
     
 there s a difference  
 i don t get how you couldn t feel like you believed  today  out there  it was so right there  you moved like you totally
believed  
     
 how do you feel inside  not  
 mario  you and i are mysterious to each other  we countenance each other from either side of some unbridgeable difference
on this issue  let s lie very quietly and ponder this  
 hal  
     
 hey hal  
 i m going to propose that i tell you a joke  boo  on the condition that afterward you shush and let me sleep  
 is it a good one  
 mario  what do you get when you cross an insomniac  an unwilling agnostic  and a dyslexic  
 i give  
 you get somebody who stays up all night torturing himself mentally over the question of whether or not there s a dog  
 that s a good one  
 shush  
 hey hal  what s an insomniac  
 somebody who rooms with you  kid  that s for sure  
 hey hal  
 how come the moms never cried when himself passed away  i cried  and you  even c t  cried  i saw him personally cry  
     
  you listened to tosca over and over and cried and said you were sad 
we all were  
     
 hey hal  did the moms seem like she got happier after himself passed away  to you  
     
 it seems like she got happier  she seems even taller  she stopped travelling everywhere all the time for this and that thing 
the corporate grammar thing  the library protest thing  
 now she never goes anywhere  boo  now she s got the headmaster s house and her office and the tunnel in between  and
never leaves the grounds  she s a worse workaholic than she ever was  and more obsessive compulsive  when s the last time you
saw a dust mote in that house  
 hey hal  
 now she s just an agoraphobic workaholic and obsessive compulsive  this strikes you as happification  
 her eyes are better  they don t seem as sunk in  they look better  she laughs at c t  way more than she laughed at himself 
she laughs from lower down inside  she laughs more  her jokes she tells are better ones than yours  even  now  a lot of the time  
     
 how come she never got sad  
 she did get sad  booboo  she just got sad in her way instead of yours and mine  she got sad  i m pretty sure  
 hal  
 you remember how the staff lowered the flag to half mast out front by the portcullis here after it happened  do you

 remember that  and it goes to half mast every year at convocation  remember the flag  boo  
 hey hal  
 don t cry  booboo  remember the flag only halfway up the pole  booboo  there are two ways to lower a flag to half mast 
are you listening  because no shit i really have to sleep here in a second  so listen   one way to lower the flag to half mast is
just to lower the flag  there s another way though  you can also just raise the pole  you can raise the pole to like twice its original
height  you get me  you understand what i mean  mario  
 hal  
 she s plenty sad  i bet  
at  oloh  on   april y d a u   the medical attache is still watching the unlabelled entertainment cartridge 
october   year of the depend adult undergarment
for orin incandenza     morning is the soul s night  the day s worst time  psychically  he cranks the condo s ac way down at
night and still most mornings wakes up soaked  fetally curled  entombed in that kind of psychic darkness where you re dreading
whatever you think of 
hal incandenza s brother orin wakes up alone at     h  amid a damp scent of ambush and on the other side s dented pillow a
note with phone   and vital data in a loopy schoolgirlish hand  there s also ambush on the note  his side of the bed is soaked 
orin makes honey toast  standing barefoot at the kitchen counter  wearing briefs and an old academy sweatshirt with the
arms cut off  squeezing honey from the head of a plastic bear  the floor s so cold it hurts his feet  but the double pane window
over the sink is hot to the touch  the beastly metro phoenix october a m  heat just outside 
home with the team  no matter how high the ac or how thin the sheet  orin wakes with his own impression sweated darkly
into the bed beneath him  slowly drying all day to a white salty outline just slightly off from the week s other faint dried outlines 
so his fetal shaped fossilized image is fanned out across his side of the bed like a deck of cards  just overlapping  like an acid trail
or timed exposure 
the heat just past the glass doors tightens his scalp  he takes breakfast out to a white iron table by the condo complex s
central pool and tries to eat it there  in the heat  the coffee not steaming or cooling  he sits there in dumb animal pain  he has a
mustache of sweat  a bright beach ball floats and bumps against one side of the pool  the sun like a sneaky keyhole view of hell 
no one else out here  the complex is a ring with the pool and deck and jacuzzi in the center  heat shimmers off the deck like
fumes from fuel  there s that mirage thing where the extreme heat makes the dry deck look wet with fuel  orin can hear cartridgeviewers going from behind closed windows  that aerobics show every morning  and also someone playing an organ  and the older
woman who won t ever smile back at him in the apartment next to his doing operatic scales  muffled by drapes and sun curtains
and double panes  the jacuzzi chugs and foams 
the note from last night s subject is on violet bond once folded and with a circle of darker violet dead center where the
subject s perfume spritzer had hit it  the only interesting thing about the script  but also depressing  is that every single circle  
o s  d s  p s  the  s   and     is darkened in  while the i s are dotted not with circles but with tiny little valentine hearts  which are
not darkened in  orin reads the note while he eats toast that s mainly an excuse for the honey  he uses his smaller right arm to eat
and drink  his oversized left arm and big left leg remain at rest at all times in the morning 
a breeze sends the beach ball skating all the way across the blue pool to the other side  and orin watches its noiseless glide 
the white iron tables have no umbrellas  and you can tell where the sun is without looking  you can feel right where it is on your
body and project from there  the ball moves tentatively back out toward the middle of the pool and then stays there  not even
bobbing  the same small breezes make the rotted palms along the condominium complex s stone walls rustle and click  and a
couple of fronds detach and spiral down  hitting the deck with a slap  all the plants out here are malevolent  heavy and sharp  the
parts of the palms above the fronds are tufted in sick stuff like coconut hair  roaches and other things live in the trees  rats 
maybe  loathsome high altitude critters of all kinds  all the plants either spiny or meaty  cacti in queer tortured shapes  the tops
of the palms like rod stewart s hair  from days gone by 
orin returned with the team from the chicago game two nights ago  redeye  he knows that he and the place kicker are the
only two starters who are not still in terrible pain  physically  from the beating 
the day before they left   so like five days ago   orin was out by himself in the jacuzzi by the pool late in the day  caring
for the leg  sitting in the radiant heat and bloody late day light with the leg in the jacuzzi  absently squeezing the tennis ball he
still absently squeezes out of habit  watching the jacuzzi funnel and bubble and foam around the leg  and out of nowhere a bird
had all of a sudden fallen into the jacuzzi  with a flat matter of fact plop  out of nowhere  out of the wide empty sky  nothing
overhung the jacuzzi but sky  the bird seemed to have just had a coronary or something in flight and died and fallen out of the
empty sky and landed dead in the jacuzzi  right by the leg  he brought his sunglasses down onto the bridge of his nose with a
finger and looked at it  it was an undistinguished kind of bird  not a predator  like a wren  maybe  it seems like no way could it
have been a good sign  the dead bird bobbed and barrel rolled in the foam  sucked under one second and reappearing the next 
creating an illusion of continued flight  orin had inherited none of the moms s phobias about disorder  hygiene   not crazy about
bugs though   roaches   but he d just sat there squeezing the ball  looking at the bird  without a conscious thought in his head  by
the next morning  waking up  curled and entombed  it seemed like it had to have been a bad sign  though 
orin now always gets the shower so hot it s to where he can just barely stand it  the condo s whole bathroom is done in this
kind of minty yellow tile he didn t choose  maybe chosen by the free safety who lived here before the cardinals sent new orleans
the free safety  two reserve guards and cash for orin incandenza  punter 
and no matter how many times he has the terminex people out  there are still the enormous roaches that come out of the
bathroom drains  sewer roaches  according to terminex  blattaria implacablus or something  really huge roaches  armoredvehicle type bugs  totally black  with kevlar type cases  the works  and fearless  raised in the hobbesian sewers down there 
boston s and new orleans s little brown roaches were bad enough  but you could at least come in and turn on a light and they d
run for their lives  these southwest sewer roaches you turn on the light and they just look up at you from the tile like   you got a
problem   orin stomped on one of them  only once  that had come hellishly up out of the drain in the shower when he was in
there  showering  going out naked and putting shoes on and coming in and trying to conventionally squash it  and the result was

 explosive  there s still material from that one time in the tile grouting  it seems unremovable  roach innards  sickening 
throwing the shoes away was preferable to looking at the sole to clean it  now he keeps big glass tumblers in the bathroom and
when he turns on the light and sees a roach he puts a glass down over it  trapping it  after a couple days the glass is all steamed up
and the roach has asphyxiated messlessly and orin discards both the roach and the tumbler in separate sealed ziplocs in the
dumpster complex by the golf course up the street 
the yellow tile floor of the bathroom is sometimes a little obstacle course of glasses with huge roaches dying inside  stoically 
just sitting there  the glasses gradually steaming up with roach dioxide  the whole thing makes orin sick  now he figures the
hotter the shower s water  the less chance any small armored vehicle is going to feel like coming out of the drain while he s in
there 
sometimes they re in the bowl of the toilet first thing in the a m   dog paddling  trying to get to the side and climb up  he s
also not crazy about spiders  though more like unconsciously  he s never come anyplace close to the conscious horror himself had
somehow developed about the south west s black widows and their chaotic webs   the widows are all over the place  both here
and tucson  spottable on all but the coldest nights  their dusty webs without any kind of pattern  clotting just about any rightangled place that s dim or out of the way  terminex s toxins are more effective on the widows  orin has them out monthly  he s on
like a subscription plan over at terminex 
orin s special conscious horror  besides heights and the early morning  is roaches  there d been parts of metro boston near the
bay he d refused to go to  as a child  roaches give him the howling fantods  the parishes around n o  had been having a spate or
outbreak of a certain latin origin breed of sinister tropical flying roaches  that were small and timid but could fucking fly  and that
kept being found swarming on new orleans infants  at night  in their cribs  especially infants in like tenements or squalor  and that
reportedly fed on the mucus in the babies  eyes  some special sort of optical mucus   the stuff of fucking nightmares  mobile
flying roaches that wanted to get at your eyes  as an infant   and were reportedly blinding them  par ents d come in in the ghastly
a m  tenement light and find their infants blind  like a dozen blinded infants that last summer  and it was during this spate or
nightmarish outbreak  plus july flooding that sent over a dozen nightmarish dead bodies from a hilltop graveyard sliding all grayblue down the incline orin and two teammates had their townhouse on  in suburban chalmette  shedding limbs and innards all the
way down the hillside s mud and one even one morning coming to rest against the post of their roadside mailbox  when orin came
out for the morning paper  that orin had had his agent put out the trade feelers  and so to the glass canyons and merciless light of
metro phoenix  in a kind of desiccated circle  near the tucson of his own father s desiccated youth 
it s the mornings after the spider and heights dreams that are the most painful  that it takes sometimes three coffees and two
showers and sometimes a run to loosen the grip on his soul s throat  and these post dream mornings are even worse if he wakes
unalone  if the previous night s subject is still there  wanting to twitter  or to cuddle and  like  spoon  asking what exactly is the
story with the foggy inverted tumblers on the bathroom floor  commenting on his night sweats  clattering around in the kitchen 
making kippers or bacon or something even more hideous and unhoneyed he s supposed to eat with post coital male gusto  the
ones who have this thing about they call it feeding my man  wanting a man who can barely keep down a m  honey toast to eat
with male gusto  elbows out and shovelling  making little noises  even when alone  able to uncurl alone and sit slowly up and
wring out the sheet and go to the bathroom  these darkest mornings start days that orin can t even bring himself for hours to think
about how he ll get through the day  these worst mornings with cold floors and hot windows and merciless light   the soul s
certainty that the day will have to be not traversed but sort of climbed  vertically  and then that going to sleep again at the end of it
will be like falling  again  off something tall and sheer 
so now his own eye mucus is secure  in the desert southwest  but the bad dreams have gotten worse since the trade to this
blasted area himself himself had fled  long ago  as an unhappy youngster 
as a nod to orin s own unhappy youth  all the dreams seem to open briefly with some sort of competitive tennis situation 
last night s had started with a wide angle shot of orin on a har tru court  waiting to receive serve from someone vague  some
academy person   ross reat maybe  or good old m  bain  or gray toothed walt flechette  now a teaching pro in the carolinas
  when the dream s screen tightens on him and abruptly dissolves to the blank dark rose color of eyes closed against bright light 
and there s the ghastly feeling of being submerged and not knowing which way to head for the surface and air  and after some
interval the dream s orin struggles up from this kind of visual suffocation to find his mother s head  mrs  avril m  t 
incandenza s  the moms s disconnected head attached face to face to his own fine head  strapped tight to his face somehow by a
wrap around system of vs hipro top shelf lamb gut string from his academy racquet s own face  so that no matter how
frantically orin tries to move his head or shake it side to side or twist up his face or roll his eyes he s still staring at  into  and
somehow through his mother s face  as if the moms s head was some sort of overtight helmet orin can t wrestle his way out of  
in the dream  it s understandably vital to orin that he disengage his head from the phylacteryish bind of his mother s disembodied
head  and he cannot  last night s subject s note indicates that at some point last night orin had clutched her head with both hands
and tried to sort of stiff arm her  though not in an ungentle or complaining way  the note  not the stiff arm   the apparent
amputation of the moms s head from the rest of the moms appears in the dream to be clean and surgically neat  there is no
evidence of a stump or any kind of nubbin of neck  even  and it is as if the base of the round pretty head had been sealed  and also
sort of rounded off  so that her head is a large living ball  a globe with a face  attached to his own head s face 
the subject after bain s sister but before the one just before this one  with the ambush scent and the hearts over i s  the
previous subject had been a sallowly pretty arizona state developmental psychology grad student with two kids and outrageous
alimony and penchants for sharp jewelry  refrigerated chocolate  interlace educational cartridges  and professional athletes who
thrashed in their sleep  not real bright   she thought the figure he d trace without thinking on her bare flank after sex was the
numeral    to give you an idea  their last morning together  right before he d mailed her child an expensive toy and then had his
phone number changed  he d awakened from a night of horror show dreams   woke up with an abrupt fetal spasm  unrefreshed
and benighted of soul  his eyes wobbling and his wet silhouette on the bottom sheet like a coroner s chalk outline   he woke to
find the subject up and sitting up against the reading pillow  wearing his sleeveless academy sweatshirt and sipping hazelnut
espresso and watching  on the cartridge viewing system that occupied half the bedroom s south wall  something horrific called
 interlace educational cartridges in conjunction with cbc educational programming

 matrix presents schizophrenia  mind or body   and had had to lie there  moist and paralyzed  curled fetal on his
own sweat shadow  and watch on the viewer a pale young guy about hal s age  with copper stubble and a red cowlick and flat
blank affectless black doll s eyes  stare into space stage left while a brisk albertan voiceover explained that fenton here was a
dyed in the wool paranoid schizophrenic who believed that radioactive fluids were invading his skull and that hugely complex
high tech type machines had been specially designed and programmed to pursue him without cease until they caught him and
made brutal sport of him and buried him alive  it was an old late millennial cbc public interest canadian news documentary 
digitally sharpened and redisseminated under the inter lace imprimatur   interlace could get kind of seedy and low rent during
early morning off hours  in terms of spontaneous disseminations 
and so but since the old cbc documentary s thesis was turning out pretty clearly to be schizophrenia  body  the
voiceover evinced great clipped good cheer as it explained that well  yes  poor old fenton here was more or less hopeless as an
extra institutional functioning unit  but that  on the up side  science could at least give his existence some sort of meaning by
studying him very carefully to help learn how schizophrenia manifested itself in the human body s brain       that  in other words 
with the aid of cutting edge positron emission topography or  p e t   technology  since supplanted wholly by invasive digitals 
orin hears the developmental psychology graduate student mutter to herself  watching rapt over her cup  unaware that orin s
paralytically awake   they could scan and study how different parts of poor old fenton s dysfunctional brain emitted positrons in a
whole different topography than your average hale and hearty nondelusional god fearing alber tan s brain  advancing science by
injecting test subject fenton here with a special blood brain barrier penetrating radioactive dye and then sticking him in the
rotating body sized receptacle of a p e t  scanner   on the viewer  it s an enormous gray metal machine that looks like
something co designed by james cameron and fritz lang  and now have a look at this fenton fellow s eyes as he starts to get the
gist of what the voiceover s saying   and in a terse old public tv cut they now showed subject fenton in five point canvas restraints whipping his copper haired head from side to side as guys in mint green surgical masks and caps inject him with
radioactive fluids through a turkey baster sized syringe  then good old fenton s eyes bugging out in total foreseen horror as he s
rolled toward the huge gray p e t  device and slid like an unrisen loaf into the thing s open maw until only his decay colored
sneakers are in view  and the body sized receptacle rotates the test subject counterclockwise  with brutal speed  so that the old
sneakers point up and then left and then down and then right and then up  faster and faster  the machine s blurps and tweets not
even coming close to covering fenton s entombed howls as his worst delusional fears came true in digital stereo and you could
hear the last surviving bits of his functional dye permeated mind being screamed out of him for all time as the viewer digitally
superimposed an image of fenton s ember red and neutron blue brain in the lower right corner  where interlace s time temp
functions usually appear  and the brisk voiceover gave capsule histories of first paranoid schizophrenia and then p e t  with orin
lying there slit eyed  wet and neuralgic with a m  dread  wishing the subject would put her own clothes and sharp jewelry on and
take the rest of her toblerone out of the freezer and go  so he could go to the bathroom and get yesterday s asphyxiated roaches
into an e w d  dumpster before the dumpsters all filled for the day  and decide what kind of expensive present to mail the
subject s kid 
and then the matter of the dead bird  out of nowhere 
and then news of pressure from the az cardinal administration to cooperate with some sort of insipid type personalityprofile series of interviews with some profiler from moment magazine  with personal backgroundish questions to be answered in
some blandly sincere team pr way  the unexamined stress of which drives him to start calling hallie again  reopen that whole
pandora s box of worms 
orin also shaves in the shower  face red with heat  wreathed in steam  by feel  shaving upward  with south to north strokes  as

here s hal incandenza  age seventeen  with his little brass one hitter  getting covertly high in the enfield tennis academy s
underground pump room and exhaling palely into an industrial exhaust fan  it s the sad little interval after afternoon matches and
conditioning but before the academy s communal supper  hal is by himself down here and nobody knows where he is or what
he s doing 
hal likes to get high in secret  but a bigger secret is that he s as attached to the secrecy as he is to getting high 
a one hitter  sort of like a long fdr type cigarette holder whose end is packed with a pinch of good dope  gets hot and is
hard on the mouth   the brass ones especially   but one hitters have the advantage of efficiency  every particle of ignited pot
gets inhaled  there s none of the incidental secondhand type smoke from a party bowl s big load  and hal can take every iota way
down deep and hold his breath forever  so that even his exhalations are no more than slightly pale and sick sweet smelling 
total utilization of available resources   lack of publicly detectable waste 
the academy s tennis courts  lung s pump room is underground and accessible only by tunnel  e t a  is abundantly 
embranchingly tunnelled  this is by design 
plus one hitters are small  which is good  because let s face it  anything you use to smoke high resin dope with is going to
stink  a bong is big  and its stink is going to be like commensurately big  plus you have the foul bong water to deal with  pipes are
smaller and at least portable  but they always come with only a multi hit party bowl that disperses nonutilized smoke over a wide
area  a one hitter can be wastelessly employed  then allowed to cool  wrapped in two baggies and then further wrapped and sealed
in a ziploc and then enclosed in two sport socks in a gear bag along with the lighter and eyedrops and mint pellets and the little
film case of dope itself  and it s highly portable and odor free and basically totally covert 
as far as hal knows  colleagues michael pemulis  jim struck  bridget c 
boone  jim troeltsch  ted schacht  trevor axford  and possibly kyle d  coyle and tall paul shaw  and remotely possibly
frannie unwin  all know hal gets regularly covertly high  it s also not impossible that bernadette longley knows  actually  and of
course the unpleasant k  freer always has suspicions of all kinds  and hal s brother mario knows a thing or two  but that s it  in
terms of public knowledge  and but even though pemulis and struck and boone and troeltsch and axford and occasionally  in a

 sort of medicinal or touristic way  slice and schacht all are known to get high also  hal has actually gotten actively high only with
pemulis  on the rare occasions he s gotten high with anybody else  as in in person  which he avoids  he d forgot  ortho   the
darkness   slice  of partridge ks  knows  and hal s oldest brother  orin  mysteriously  even long distance  seems to know more
than he s coming right out and saying  unless hal s reading more into some of the phone comments than are there 
hal s mother  mrs  avril incandenza  and her adoptive brother dr  charles tavis  the current e t a  headmaster  both know
hal drinks alcohol sometimes  like on weekend nights with troeltsch or maybe axford down the hill at clubs on commonwealth
ave   the unexamined life has its notorious blind bouncer night every friday where they card you on the honor system  mrs 
avril incandenza isn t crazy about the idea of hal drinking  mostly because of the way his father had drunk  when alive  and
reportedly his father s own father before him  in az and ca  but hal s academic precocity  and especially his late competitive
success on the junior circuit  make it clear that he s able to handle whatever modest amounts she s pretty sure he consumes  
there s no way someone can seriously abuse a substance and perform at top scholarly and athletic levels  the e t a  psychcounselor dr  rusk assures her  especially the high level athletic part   and avril feels it s important that a concerned but unsmothering single parent know when to let go somewhat and let the two high functioning of her three sons make their own
possible mistakes and learn from their own valid experience  no matter how much the secret worry about mistakes tears her
gizzard out  the mother s  and charles supports whatever personal decisions she makes in conscience about her children  and god
knows she d rather have hal having a few glasses of beer every so often than absorbing god alone knows what sort of esoteric
designer compounds with reptilian michael pemulis and trail of slime leaving james struck  both of whom give avril a howling
case of the maternal fantods  and ultimately  she s told drs  rusk and tavis  she d rather have hal abide in the security of the
knowledge that his mother trusts him  that she s trusting and supportive and doesn t judge or gizzard tear or wring her fine hands
over his having for instance a glass of canadian ale with friends every now and again  and so works tremendously hard to hide her
maternal dread of his possibly ever drinking like james himself or james s father  all so that hal might enjoy the security of
feeling that he can be up front with her about issues like drinking and not feel he has to hide anything from her under any
circumstances 
dr  tavis and dolores rusk have privately discussed the fact that not least among the phobic stressors avril suffers so
uncomplainingly with is a black phobic dread of hiding or secrecy in all possible forms with respect to her sons 
avril and c  t  know nothing about hal s penchants for high resin bob hope and underground absorption  which fact hal
obviously likes a lot  on some level  though he s never given much thought to why  to why he likes it so much 
e t a  s hilltop grounds are traversable by tunnel  avril i   for example  who never leaves the grounds anymore  rarely travels
above ground  willing to hunch to take the off tunnels between headmaster s house and her office next to charles tavis s in the
community and administration bldg   a pink bricked white pillared neo georgian thing that hal s brother mario says looks like a
cube that has swallowed a ball too big for its stomach   two sets of elevators and one of stairs run between the lobby  reception
area  and administrative offices on comm  ad  s first floor and the weight room  sauna  and locker shower areas on the sublevel
below it  one large tunnel of elephant colored cement leads from just off the boys  showers to the mammoth laundry room below
the west courts  and two smaller tunnels radiate from the sauna area south and east to the subbasements of the smaller 
spherocubular  pro to georgian buildings  housing classrooms and subdor mitories b and d   these two basements and smaller
tunnels often serve as student storage space and hallways between various prorectors   private rooms  then two even smaller
tunnels  navigable by any adult willing to assume a kind of knuckle dragging simian posture  in turn connect each of the
subbasements to the former optical and film development facilities of leith and ogilvie and the late dr  james o  incandenza
 now deceased  below and just west of the headmaster s house  from which facilities there s also a fair diametered tunnel that
goes straight to the lowest level of the community and administration bldg   but its functions have gradually changed over four
years  and it s now too full of exposed wiring and hot water pipes and heating ducts to be really passable  and to the offices of the
physical plant  almost directly beneath the center row of e t a  outdoor tennis courts  which offices and custodial lounge are in
turn connected to e t a  s lung storage and  pump rooms via a pargeted tunnel hastily constructed by the testar ail weather
inflatable structures corp   which together with the folks over at athscme industrial air displacement devices erects and
services the inflatable dendriurethane dome  known as the lung  that covers the middle row of courts for the winter indoor season 
the crude little rough sided tunnel between plant and pump is traversable only via all fours type crawling and is essentially
unknown to staff and administration  popular only with the academy s smaller kids  tunnel club  as well as with certain
adolescents with strong secret incentive to crawl on all fours 
the lung storage room is basically impassable from march through november because it s full of intricately folded
dendriurethane lung material and dismantled sections of flexible ducting and fan blades  etc  the pump room is right next to it 
though you have to crawl back out into the tunnel to get to it  on the engineering diagrams the pump room s maybe about twenty
meters directly beneath the centermost courts in the middle row of courts  and looks like a kind of spider hanging upside down  
an unfenestrated oval chamber with six man sized curved ducts radiating up and out to exit points on the grounds above  and the
pump room has six radial openings  one for each upcurving duct  three two meter vents with huge turbine bladed exhaust fans
bolted into their grilles and three more  m s with reversed athscme intake fans that allow air from the ground above to be
sucked down and around the room and up into the three exhaust vents  the pump room is essentially like a pulmonary organ  or
the epicenter of a massive six vectored wind tunnel  and when activated roars like a banshee that s slammed its hand in a door 
though the p r  s in full legit operation only when the lung is up  usually november march  the intake fans pullground level
winter air down into and around the room and through the three exhaust fans and up the outtake ducts into networks of pneumatic
tubing in the lung s sides and dome  it s the pressure of the moving air that keeps the fragile lung inflated 
when the courts  lung is down and stored  hal will descend and walk and then hunch his way in to make sure nobody s in the
physical plant quarters  then he ll hunch and crawl to the p r   gear bag in his teeth  and activate just one of the big exhaust fans
and get secretly high and exhale palely through its blades into the vent  so that any possible odor is blown through an outtake duct
and expelled through a grille d hole on the west side of the west courts  a threaded hole  with a flange  where brisk white suited
athscme guys will attach some of the lung s arterial pneumatic tubing at some point soon when schtitt et al  on staff decide
the real weather has moved past enduring for outdoor tennis 

 during winter months  when any expelled odor would get ducted up into the lung and hang there conspicuous  hal mostly
goes into a remote sub dormitory lavatory and climbs onto a toilet in a stall and exhales into the grille of one of the little exhaust
fans in the ceiling  but this routine lacks a certain intricate subterranean covert drama  it s another reason why hal dreads
interdependence day and the approach of the whataburger classic and thanksgiving and unendurable weather  and the erection
of the lung 
recreational drugs are more or less traditional at any u s  secondary school  maybe because of the unprecedented tensions 
post latency and puberty and angst and impending adulthood  etc  to help manage the intra psychic storms  etc  since the place s
inception  there s always been a certain percentage of the high caliber adolescent players at e t a  who manage their internal
weathers chemically  much of this is good clean temporary fun  but a traditionally smaller and harder core set tends to rely on
personal chemistry to manage e t a  s special demands   dexedrine or low volt methedrine   before matches and
benzodiazapenes   to come back down after matches  with mudslides or blue flames at some understanding comm  ave 
nightspot   or beers and bongs in some discreet academy corner at night to short circuit the up and down cycle  mushrooms or x
or something from the mild designer class     or maybe occasionally a little black star    whenever there s a match  and
demand free weekend  to basically short out the whole motherboard and blow out all the circuits and slowly recover and be almost
neurologically reborn and start the gradual cycle all over again      this circular routine  if your basic wiring s ok to begin with 
can work surprisingly well throughout adolescence and sometimes into one s like early twenties  before it starts to creep up on
you 
but so some e t a s   not just hal incandenza by any means   are involved with recreational substances  is the point  like
who isn t  at some life stage  in the u s a  and interdependent regions  in these troubled times  for the most part  though a decent
percentage of e t a  students aren t at all  i e  involved  some persons can give themselves away to an ambitious pursuit and have
that be all the giving themselves away to something they need to do  though sometimes this changes as the players get older and
the pursuit more stress fraught  american experience seems to suggest that people are virtually unlimited in their need to give
themselves away  on various levels  some just prefer to do it in secret 
an enrolled student athlete s use of alcohol or illicit chemicals is cause for immediate expulsion  according to e t a  s
admissions catalogue  but the e t a  staff tends to have a lot more important stuff on its plate than policing kids who ve already
given themselves away to an ambitious competitive pursuit  the administrative attitude under first james incandenza and then
charles tavis is  like  why would anybody who wanted to compromise his faculties chemically even come here  to e t a   where
the whole point is to stress and stretch your faculties along multiple vectors      and since it s the alumni prorectors who have
the most direct supervisory contact with the kids  and since most of the prorectors themselves are depressed or traumatized about
not making it into the show and having to come back to e t a  and live in decent but subterranean rooms off the tunnels and
work as assistant coaches and teach laughable elective classes   which is what the eight e t a  prorectors do  when they re not
off playing satellite tournaments or trying to make it through the qualifying rounds of some serious money event   and so they re
morose and low on morale  and feel bad about themselves  often  as a rule  and so also not all that surprisingly tend to get high
now and then themselves  though in a less covert or exuberant fashion than the hard core students  chemical cadre  but so given all
this it s not hard to see why internal drug enforcement at e t a  tends to be flaccid  the other nice thing about the pump room is
the way it s connected by tunnel to the prorectors  rows of housing units  which means men s rooms  which means hal can crawl 
hunch  and tiptoe into an unoccupied men s room and brush his teeth with his portable oral b and wash his face and apply
eyedrops and old spice and a plug of wintergreen kodiak and then saunter back to the sauna area and ascend to ground level
looking and smelling right as rain  because when he gets high he develops a powerful obsession with having nobody   not even
the neurochemical cadre   know he s high  this obsession is almost irresistible in its force  the amount of organization and
toiletry lugging he has to do to get secretly high in front of a subterranean outtake vent in the pre supper gap would make a lesser
man quail  hal has no idea why this is  or whence  this obsession with the secrecy of it  he broods on it abstractly sometimes 
when high  this no one must know thing  it s not fear per se  fear of discovery  beyond that it all gets too abstract and twined up
to lead to anything  hal s brooding  like most north americans of his generation  hal tends to know way less about why he feels
certain ways about the objects and pursuits he s devoted to than he does about the objects and pursuits themselves  it s hard to say
for sure whether this is even exceptionally bad  this tendency

drug addicts driven to crime to finance their drug addiction are not often inclined toward violent crime  violence requires all
different kinds of energy  and most drug addicts like to expend their energy not on their professional crime but on what their
professional crime lets them afford  drug addicts are often burglars  therefore  one reason why the home of someone whose home
has been burglarized feels violated and unclean is that there have probably been drug addicts in there  don gately was a twentyseven year old oral narcotics addict  favoring demerol and talwin       and a more or less professional burglar  and he was 

 himself  unclean and violated  but he was a gifted burglar  when he burgled   though the size of a young dinosaur  with a
massive and almost perfectly square head he used to amuse his friends when drunk by letting them open and close elevator doors
on  he was  at his professional zenith  smart  sneaky  quiet  quick  possessed of good taste and reliable transportation   with a
kind of ferocious jolliness in his attitude toward his livelihood 
as an active drug addict  gately was distinguished by his ferocious and jolly elan  he kept his big square chin up and his
smile wide  but he bowed neither toward nor away from any man  he took zero in the way of shit and was a cheery but implacable
exponent of the don t get mad get even school  like for instance once  after he d done a really unpleasant three month bit in
revere holding on nothing more than a remorseless north shore assistant district attorney s circumstantial suspicion  finally
getting out after    days when his p d  got the charges dismissed on a right to speedy brief  gately and a trusted associate    
paid a semiprofessional visit to the private home of this assistant d a  whose zeal and warrant had cost gately a nasty impromptu
detox on the floor of his little holding cell  also a believer in the revenge is tastier chilled dictum  gately had waited patiently
until the  eye on people  section of the globe mentioned the a d a  and his wife s presence at some celebrity charity sailing thing
out in mar blehead  gately and the associate went that night to the a d a  s private home in the upscale wonderland valley
section of revere  killed the power to the home with a straight shunt in the meter s inflow  then clipped just the ground wire on the
home s pricey hbt alarm  so that the alarm d sound after ten or so minutes and create the impression that the perps had somehow
bungled the alarm and been scared off in the middle of the act  later that night  when revere s and marblehead s finest
summoned them home  the a d a  and his wife found themselves minus a coin collection and two antique shotguns and nothing
more  quite a few other valuables were stacked on the floor of the living room off the foyer like the perps hadn t had time to get
them out of the house  everything else in the burglarized home looked undisturbed  the a d a  was a jaded pro  he walked
around touching the brim of his hat     and reconstructed probable events  the perps looked like they d bungled disabling the
alarm all the way and had got scared off by the thing s siren when the alarm s pricey hbt alternate ground kicked in at     v  the
a d a  soothed his wife s sense of violation and uncleanliness  he calmly insisted on sleeping there in their home that very night 
no hotel  it was like crucial to get right back on the emotional horse  in cases like this  he insisted  and then the next day the
a d a  worked out the insurance and reported the shotguns to a buddy at a t f      and his wife calmed down and life went on 
about a month later  an envelope arrived in the a d a  s home s exquisite wrought iron mailbox  in the envelope were a
standard american dental association glossy brochure on the importance of daily oral hygiene   available at like any dentist s
office anywhere   and two high pixel polaroid snapshots  one of big don gately and one of his associate  each in a halloween
mask denoting a clown s great good professional cheer  each with his pants down and bent over and each with the enhanced focus
handle of one of the couple s toothbrushes protruding from his bottom 
don gately had sense enough never to work the north shore again after that  but he ended up in hideous trouble anyway 
a d a  wise  it was either bad luck or kismet or so forth  it was because of a cold  a plain old human rhinovirus  and not even
don gately s cold  is what made him finally stop and question his kismet 
the thing started out looking like tit on a tray  burglary wise  a beautiful neo georgian home in a wildly upscale part of
brookline was set nicely back from an unlit pseudo rural road  had a chintzy sentryco alarm system that fed  idiotically enough 
on a whole separate     v ac    hz cable with its own meter  didn t seem to be on anything like a regular p m  patrol route  and
had  at its rear  flimsily tasteful french doors surrounded by dense and thorn free deciduous shrubbery and blocked off from the
garage s halogen floods by a private e w d  issue upscale dumpster  it was in short a real cock tease of a home  burglary wise  for
a drug addict  and don gately straight shunted the alarm s meter and  with an associate      broke and entered and crept around
on huge cat feet 
except unfortunately the owner of the house turned out to be still home  even though both of his cars and the rest of his
family were gone  the little guy was asleep sick in bed upstairs in acetate pajamas with a hot water bottle on his chest and half a
glass of oj and a bottle of nyquil     and a foreign book and copies of international affairs and interdependent affairs and a
pair of thick specs and an industrial size box of kleenex on the bedside table and an empty vaporizer barely humming at the foot
of the bed  and the guy was to say the least nonplussed to wake up and see high filter flashlights crisscrossing over the unlit
bedroom walls and bureau and teak chiffonnier as gately and associate scanned for a wall safe  which surprisingly like     of
people with wall safes conceal in their master bedroom behind some sort of land  or seascape painting  people turned out so
identical in certain root domestic particulars it made gately feel strange sometimes  like he was in possession of certain overlarge
private facts to which no man should be entitled  gately had a way stickier conscience about the possession of some of these large
particular facts than he did about making off with other people s personal merchandise  but then all of a sudden in mid silentsearch for a safe here s this upscale homeowner turning out to be home with a nasty head cold while his family s out on a two car
foliage tour in what s left of the berkshires  writhing groggily and ny quilized around on the bed and making honking adenoidal
sounds and asking what in bloody hell is the meaning of this  except he s saying it in quebecois french  which means to these
thuggish u s  drug addicts in halloween clowns  masks exactly nothing  he s sitting up in bed  a little and older type homeowner
with a football shaped head and gray van dyke and eyes you can tell are used to corrective lenses as he switches on the bright
bedside lamp  gately could easily have screwed out of there and never looked back  but here indeed  in the lamplight  is a
seascape over next to the chiffonnier  and the associate has a quick peek and reports that the safe behind it is to laugh at  it can be
opened with harsh language  almost  and oral narcotics addicts tend to operate on an extremely rigid physical schedule of need and
satisfaction  and gately is at this moment firmly in the need part of the schedule  and so d  w  gately disastrously decides to go
ahead and allow a nonviolent burglary to become in effect a robbery   which the operative legal difference involves either
violence or the coercive threat of same   and gately draws himself up to his full menacing height and shines his flashlight in the
little homeowner s rheumy eyes and addresses him the way menacing criminals speak in popular entertainment   d s for th s  various apocopes  and so on   and takes hold of the guy s ear and conducts him down to a kitchen chair and binds his arms and legs
to the chair with electrical cords neatly clipped from refrigerator and can opener and m  cafe brand automatic cafe au laitmaker  binds him just short of gan grenously tight  because he s hoping the berkshire foliage is prime and the guy s going to be
soloing in this chair for a good stretch of time  and gately starts looking through the kitchen s drawers for the silverware   not
the good silver for company silverware  that was in a calfskin case underneath some neatly folded old spare christmas wrapping

 in a stunning hardwood with ivory inlay chest of drawers in the living room  where over     of upscale people s good silver is
always hidden  and has already been promoted and is piled     just off the foyer   but just the regular old everyday flatware
silverware  because the vast bulk of homeowners keep their dish towels two drawers below their everyday silverware drawer  and
god s made no better call for help stifling gag in the world than a good old oily smelling fake linen dish towel  and the bound guy
in the cords on the chair suddenly snaps to the implications of what gately s looking for and is struggling and saying  do not gag
me  i have a terrible cold  my nose she is a brick of the snot  i have not the power to breathe through the nose  for the love of god
please do not gag my mouth  and as a gesture of goodwill the homeowner tells gately  who s rummaging  the combination of the
bedroom s seascape safe  except in french numbers  which together with the honking adenoidal inflection the guy s grippe gives
his speech doesn t even sound like human speech to gately  and but also the guy tells gately there are some antique pre britishtakeover quebecois gold coins in a calfskin purse taped to the back of an undistinguished impressionist landscape in the living
room  but everything the canadian homeowner says means no more to poor old don gately  whistling a jolly tune and trying to
look menacing in his clown s mask  than the cries of  say  north shore gulls or inland grackles  and sure enough the towels are
two drawers under the spoons  and here comes gately across the kitchen looking like a sort of bozo from hell  and the quebecer
guy s mouth goes oval with horror  and into that mouth goes a balled up  faintly greasy smelling kitchen towel  and across the
guy s cheeks and over the dome of protruding linen goes some fine quality fibrous strapping tape from the drawer under the
decommissioned phone   why does everybody keep the serious mailing supplies in the drawer nearest the kitchen phone    and
don gately and associate finish their swift and with the best of intentions nonviolent business of stripping the brookline home as
bare as a post feral hamster meadow  and they relock the front door and hit the unlit road in gately s reliable and doublemufflered  x   and the bound  wheezing  acetate clad canadian   the right hand man to probably the most infamous antio n a n  organizer north of the great concavity  the lieutenant and trouble shooting trusted adviser who selflessly volunteered to
move with his family to the savagely american area of metro boston to act as liaison between and general leash holder for the
half dozen or so malevolent and mutually antagonistic groups of quebecer separatists and albertan ultra rightists united only in
their fanatical conviction that the u s a  s experialistic  gift  or  return  of the so calledly  reconfigured  great convexity to its
northern neighbor and o n a n  ally constituted an intolerable blow to canadian sovereignty  honor  and hygiene   this
homeowner  unquestionably a v i p   although admittedly rather a covert v i p   or probably more accurately a  p   t        in
french  this meek looking canadian terrorism coordinator   bound to his chair  thoroughly gagged  sitting there  alone  under
cold fluorescent kitchen lights      the rhinovirally afflicted man  gagged with skill and quality materials   the guy  having
worked so hard to partially clear one clotted nasal passage that he tore intercostal ligaments in his ribs  soon found even that
pinprick of air blocked off by mucus s implacable lava like flow once again  and so has to tear more ligaments trying to breach the
other nostril  and so on  and after an hour of struggle and flames in his chest and blood on his lips and the white kitchen towel
from trying frantically to tongue the towel out past the tape  which is quality tape  and after hopes skyrocketing when the doorbell
rings and then hopes blackly dashed when the person at the door  a young woman with a clipboard and chewing gum who s offering promotional coupons good for happy holidays discounts on memberships of six months or more at a string of boston non uv
tanning salons  shrugs in her parka and makes a mark on the clipboard and blithely retreats down the long driveway to the pseudorural road  an hour of this or more  finally the quebecois p i t   after unspeakable agony   slow suffocation  mucoidal or no 
being no day at the montreal tulip fest   at the height of which agony  hearing his head s pulse as receding thunder and
watching his vision s circle shrink as a red aperture around his sight rotates steadily in from the edges  at the height of which he
could think only  despite the pain and panic  of what a truly dumb and silly way this was  after all this time  to die  a thought
which the towel and tape denied expression via the rueful grin with which the best men meet the dumbest ends   this guillaume
duplessis passed bluely from this life  and sat there  in the kitchen chair      clicks due east of some really spectacular autumn
foliage  for almost two nights and days  his posture getting more and more military as rigor mortis set in  with his bare feet
looking like purple loaves of bread  from the lividity  and when brookline s finest were finally summoned and got him unbound
from the coldly lit chair  they had to carry him out as if he were still seated  so militarily comme il faut had his limbs and spine
hardened  and poor old don gately  whose professional habit of killing power with straight shunts to a meter s inflow was pretty
much a signature m o   and who had  of course  a special place in the heart of a remorseless revere a d a  with judicial clout
throughout boston s three counties and beyond  an of course particularly remorseless a d a   as of late  whose wife now needed
valium even just to floss  and was patiently awaiting his chance  the a d a  was  coldly biding his time  being a patient get even
and cold dish man just like don gately  who was  through no will to energy consuming violence on his part  in the sort of a hell

his throat  then that overfull heat in various cranial meatus  then he sneezed and the stuff he sneezed out was thick and doughy  it
came on ultra fast and out of the pre drill blue  he s back in bed now  supine  watching the match s fourth set but not calling the

it s literally  daydreaming   sick  the kind of incomplete fugue you awaken from with a sort of psychic clunk  struggling up to
sit upright  convinced there s someone unauthorized in the dorm room with you  falling back sick on his circle stained pillow

worst dreams  form itself  the sudden intra dream realization that the nightmares  very essence and center has been with you all

turning your head to look back at what s been right there all along  the whole time     your first nightmare away from home and

doctors tend to enter the arenas of their profession s practice with a brisk good cheer that they have to then stop and try to
mute a bit when the arena they re entering is a hospital s fifth floor  a psych ward  where brisk good cheer would amount to a kind
of gloating  this is why doctors on psych wards so often wear a vaguely fake frown of puzzled concentration  if and when you see
them in fifth floor halls  and this is why a hospital m d    who s usually hale and pink cheeked and poreless  and who almost
always smells unusually clean and good   approaches any psych patient under his care with a professional manner somewhere
between bland and deep  a distant but sincere concern that s divided evenly between the patient s subjective discomfort and the
hard facts of the case 
the doctor who poked his fine head just inside her hot room s open door and knocked maybe a little too gently on the metal
jamb found kate gom pert lying on her side on the slim hard bed in blue jeans and a sleeveless blouse with her knees drawn up to

 her abdomen and her fingers laced around her knees  something almost too overt about the pathos of the posture  this exact
position was illustrated in some melancholic watteau era print on the frontispiece to yevtuschenko s field guide to clinical
states  kate gompert wore dark blue boating sneakers without socks or laces  half her face obscured by the either green or yellow
case on the plastic pillow  her hair so long unwashed it had separated into discrete shiny strands  and black bangs lay like a cell s
glossy bars across the visible half of the forehead  the psych ward smelled faintly of disinfectant and the community lounge s
cigarette smoke  the sour odor of medical waste awaiting collection with also that perpetual slight ammoniac tang of urine  and
there was the double bing of the elevator and the always faraway sound of the intercom paging some m d   and some high volume
cursing from a manic in the pink quiet room at the other end of the psych ward hall from the community lounge  kate
gompert s room also smelled of singed dust from the heat vent  also of the over sweet perfume worn by the young mental health
staffer who sat in a chair at the foot of the girl s bed  chewing blue gum and viewing a soundless rom cartridge on a ward issue
laptop  kate gompert was on specials  which meant suicide watch  which meant that the girl had at some point betrayed both
ideation and intent  which meant she had to be watched right up close by a staffer twenty four hours a day until the supervising
m d  called off the specials  staffers rotated specials duty every hour  ostensibly so that whoever was on duty was always fresh
and keenly observant  but really because simply sitting there at the foot of a bed looking at somebody who was in so much psychic
pain she wanted to commit suicide was incredibly depressing and boring and unpleasant  so they spread the odious duty out as thin
as they possibly could  the staffers  they were not technically supposed to read  do paperwork  view cd roms  do personal
grooming  or in any way divert their attention from the patient on specials  on duty  the patient ms  gompert seemed both to be
fighting for breath and to be breathing rapidly enough to induce hypocapnia  the doctor could not be expected not also to notice
that she had fairly large breasts that rose and fell rapidly inside the circle of arms with which she hugged her knees  the girl s
eyes  which were dull  had registered his appearance in the doorway  but they didn t seem to track as he came toward the bed  the
staffer was also employing an emery board  the doctor told the staffer that he was going to need a few moments alone with ms 
gompert  it is a sort of requirement that a doctor whenever possible be reading or at least looking down at something on his
clipboard when addressing a subordinate  so the doctor was looking studiously at the patient s intake and the sheaf of charts and
records med netted over from trauma and psych wards in some other city hospitals  gompert  katherine a       newton ma

the attempt had been serious  a real attempt  this girl had not been futzing around  a bona fide clinical admit right out of
yevtuschenko or dretske  over half the admits to psych wards are things like cheerleaders who swallow two bottles of mydol
over a high school breakup or gray lonely asexual depressing people rendered inconsolable by the death of a pet  the cathartic
trauma of actually going in somewhere officially psych   some understanding nods  some bare indication somebody gives half a
damn   they rally  back out they go  three determined attempts and a course of shock spelled no such case here  the doctor s
interior state was somewhere between trepidation and excitement  which manifested outwardly as a sort of blandly deep puzzled
concern 
the doctor said hi and that he wanted to ascertain for sure that she was katherine gompert  as they hadn t met before up till
now 
 that s me   in a bit of a bitter singsong  her voice was oddly lit up for one who lay fetal  dead eyed  w o facial affect 
the doctor said could she tell him a little bit about why she s here with them right now  can she remember back to what
happened 
she took an even deeper breath  she was attempting to communicate boredom or irritation   i took a hundred ten parnate 
about thirty lithonate capsules  some old zoloft  i took everything i had in the world  
 you really must have wanted to hurt yourself  then  it seems  
 they said downstairs the parnate made me black out  it did a blood pressure thing  my mother heard noises upstairs and
found me she said down on my side chewing the rug in my room  my room s shag carpeted  she said i was on the floor flushed
red and all wet like when i was a newborn  she said she thought at first she hallucinated me as a newborn again  on my side all
red and wet  
 a hypertensive crisis will do that  it means your blood pressure was high enough to have killed you  sertraline in
combination with an maoi     will kill you  in enough quantities  and with the toxicity of that much lithium besides  i d say
you re pretty lucky to be here right now  
 my mother sometimes thinks she s hallucinating  
 sertraline  by the way  is the zoloft you kept instead of discarding as instructed when changing medications  
 she says i chewed a big hole out of the carpet  but who can say  
the doctor chose his second finest pen from the array in his white coat s breast pocket and made some sort of note on kate
gompert s new chart for this particular psych ward  crowded in among his pocket s pens was the rubber head of a diagnostic
plexor  he asked kate if she could tell him why she had wanted to hurt herself  had she been angry at herself  at someone else 
had she ceased to feel as though her life had meaning to it  had she heard anything like voices suggesting that she hurt herself 
there was no audible response  the girl s breathing had slowed to just rapid  the doctor took an early clinical gamble and

 asked kate whether it might not be easier if she rolled over and sat up so that they could speak with each other more normally 
face to face 
 i am sitting up  
the doctor s pen was poised  his slow nod was studious  blandly puzzled seeming   you mean to say you feel right now as if
your body is already in a sitting up position  
she rolled an eye up at him for a long moment  sighed meaningfully  and rolled and rose  katherine ann gompert probably
felt that here was yet another psych ward m d  with zero sense of humor  this was probably because she did not understand the
strict methodological limits that dictated how literal he  a doctor  had to be with the admits on the psych ward  nor that jokes and
sarcasm were here usually too pregnant and fertile with clinical significance not to be taken seriously  sarcasm and jokes were
often the bottle in which clinical depressives sent out their most plangent screams for someone to care and help them  the doctor
  who by the way wasn t an m d  yet but a resident  here on a twelve week psych rotation   indulged this clinical reverie while
the patient made an elaborate show of getting the thin pillow out from under her and leaning it up the tall way against the bare
wall behind the bed and slumping back against it  her arms crossed over her breasts  the doctor decided that her open display of
irritation with him could signify either a positive thing or nothing at all 
kate gompert stared at a point over the man s left shoulder   i wasn t trying to hurt myself  i was trying to kill myself  there s
a difference  
the doctor asked whether she could try to explain what she felt the difference was between those two things 
the delay that preceded her reply was only marginally longer than the pause in a regular civilian conversation  the doctor
had no ideas about what this observation might indicate 
 do you guys see different kinds of suicides  
the resident made no attempt to ask kate gompert what she meant  she used one finger to remove some material from the
corner of her mouth 
 i think there must be probably different types of suicides  i m not one of the self hating ones  the type of like  i m shit and
the world d be better off without poor me  type that says that but also imagines what everybody ll say at their funeral  i ve met
types like that on wards  poor me i hate me punish me come to my funeral  then they show you a    x    glossy of their dead
cat  it s all self pity bullshit  it s bullshit  i didn t have any special grudges  i didn t fail an exam or get dumped by anybody  all
these types  hurt themselves   still that intriguing  unsettling combination of blank facial masking and conventionally animated
vocal tone  the doctor s small nods were designed to appear not as responses but as invitations to continue  what dretske called
momentumizers 
 i didn t want to especially hurt myself  or like punish  i don t hate myself  i just wanted out  i didn t want to play anymore is
all  
 play   nodding in confirmation  making small quick notes 
 i wanted to just stop being conscious  i m a whole different type  i wanted to stop feeling this way  if i could have just put
myself in a really long coma i would have done that  or given myself shock i would have done that  instead  
the doctor was writing with great industry 
 the last thing more i d want is hurt  i just didn t want to feel this way anymore  i don t    i didn t believe this feeling would
ever go away  i don t  i still don t  i d rather feel nothing than this  
the doctor s eyes appeared keenly interested in an abstract way  they looked severely magnified behind his attractive but
thick glasses  the frames of which were steel  patients on other floors during other rotations had sometimes complained that they
sometimes felt like something in a jar he was studying intently through all that thick glass  he was saying  this feeling of wanting
to stop feeling by dying  then  is   
the way she suddenly shook her head was vehement  exasperated   the feeling is why i want to  the feeling is the reason i
want to die  i m here because i want to die  that s why i m in a room without windows and with cages over the lightbulbs and no
lock on the toilet door  why they took my shoelaces and my belt  but i notice they don t take away the feeling do they  
 is the feeling you re explaining something you ve experienced in your other depressions  then  katherine  
the patient didn t respond right away  she slid her foot out of her shoes and touched one bare foot with the toes of the other
foot  her eyes tracked this activity  the conversation seemed to have helped her focus  like most clinically depressed patients  she
appeared to function better in focused activity than in stasis  their normal paralyzed stasis allowed these patients  own minds to
chew them apart  but it was always a titanic struggle to get them to do anything to help them focus  most residents found the fifth
floor a depressing place to do a rotation 
 what i m trying to ask  i think  is whether this feeling you re communicating is the feeling you associate with your
depression  
her gaze moved off   that s what you guys want to call it  i guess  
the doctor clicked his pen slowly a few times and explained that he s more interested here in what she would choose to call
the feeling  since it was her feeling 
the resumed study of the movement of her feet   when people call it that i always get pissed off because i always think
depression sounds like you just get like really sad  you get quiet and melancholy and just like sit quietly by the window sighing or
just lying around  a state of not caring about anything  a kind of blue kind of peaceful state   she seemed to the doctor decidedly
more animated now  even as she seemed unable to meet his eyes  her respiration had sped back up  the doctor recalled classic
hyperventila tory episodes being characterized by carpopedal spasms  and reminded himself to monitor the patient s hands and
feet carefully during the interview for any signs of tetanic contraction  in which case the prescribed therapy would be i v  calcium
in a saline percentage he would need quickly to look up 
 well this    she gestured at herself   isn t a state  this is a feeling  i feel it all over  in my arms and legs  
 that would include your carp your hands and feet  
 all over  my head  throat  butt  in my stomach  it s all over everywhere  i don t know what i could call it  it s like i can t get
enough outside it to call it anything  it s like horror more than sadness  it s more like horror  it s like something horrible is about to

 happen  the most horrible thing you can imagine   no  worse than you can imagine because there s the feeling that there s
something you have to do right away to stop it but you don t know what it is you have to do  and then it s happening  too  the
whole horrible time  it s about to happen and also it s happening  all at the same time  
 so you d say anxiety is a big part of your depressions  
it was now not clear whether she was responding to the doctor or not   everything gets horrible  everything you see gets ugly 
lurid is the word  doctor carton said lurid  one time  that s the right word for it  and everything sounds harsh  spiny and harshsounding  like every sound you hear all of a sudden has teeth  and smelling like i smell bad even after i just got out of the shower 
it s like what s the point of washing if everything smells like i need another shower  
the doctor looked intrigued rather than concerned for a moment as he wrote all this down  he preferred handwritten notes to
a laptop because he felt m d s who typed into their laps during clinical interviews gave a cold impression 
kate gompert s face writhed for a moment while the doctor was writing   i fear this feeling more than i fear anything  man 
more than pain  or my mom dying  or environmental toxicity  anything  
 fear is a major part of anxiety   the doctor confirmed 
katherine gompert seemed to come out of her dark reverie for a moment  she stared full frontal at the doctor for several
seconds  and the doctor  who d had all discomfort at being stared at by patients trained right out of him when he d rotated through
the paralysis  plegia wards upstairs  was able to look directly back at her with a kind of bland compassion  the expression of
someone who was compassionate but was not  of course  feeling what she was feeling  and who honored her subjective feelings
by not even trying to pretend that he was  sharing them  the young woman s expression  in turn  revealed that she had decided to
take what amounted for her to her own gamble  this early in a therapeutic relationship  the abstract resolve on her face now
duplicated what had been on the doctor s face when he d taken the gamble of asking her to sit up straight 
 listen   she said   have you ever felt sick  i mean nauseous  like you knew you were going to throw up  
the doctor made a gesture like well sure 
 but that s just in your stomach   kate gompert said   it s a horrible feeling but it s just in your stomach  that s why the term is
 sick to your stomach     she was back to looking intently at her lower carpopedals   what i told dr  garton is ok but imagine if
you felt that way all over  inside  all through you  like every cell and every atom or brain cell or whatever was so nauseous it
wanted to throw up  but it couldn t  and you felt that way all the time  and you re sure  you re positive the feeling will never go
away  you re going to spend the rest of your natural life feeling like this  
the doctor wrote down something much too brief to correspond directly to what she d said  he was nodding both while he
wrote and when he looked up   and yet this nauseated feeling has come and gone for you in the past  it s passed eventually during
prior depressions  katherine  has it not  
 but when you re in the feeling you forget  the feeling feels like it s always been there and will always be there  and you
forget  it s like this whole filter drops down over the whole way you think about everything  a couple weeks after   
they sat and looked at each other  the doctor felt some combination of intense clinical excitement and anxiety about perhaps
saying the wrong thing at such a crucial juncture and fouling up  his last name was needle pointed in yellow braid on the left
breast of the white coat he was required to wear   i m sorry  a couple weeks after    
he waited for seven breaths 
 i want shock   she said finally   isn t part of this whole concerned kindness deal that you re supposed to ask me how i think
you can be of help  cause i ve been through this before  you haven t asked what i want  isn t it  well how about either give me
ect     again  or give me my belt back  because i can t stand feeling like this another second  and the seconds keep coming on
and on  
 well   the doctor said slowly  nodding to indicate he had heard the feelings the young woman was expressing   well  i m
happy to discuss treatment options with you  katherine  but i have to say right now i m curious about what you started it sounded
like to me to maybe start to indicate what might have occurred  something  two weeks ago to make you feel these feelings now 
would you be comfortable talking to me about it  
 either ect or you could just sedate me for a month  you could do that  all i d need is i think a month at the outside  like a
controlled coma  you could do that  if you guys want to help  
the doctor gazed at her with a patience she was meant to see 
and she gave him back a frightening smile  a smile empty of all affect  as if someone had contracted her circumorals with a
thigmotactic electrode  the teeth of the smile evidenced a clinical depressive s classic inattention to oral hygiene 
she said  i was thinking i was about to say you ll think i m crazy if i tell you  but then i remembered where i am   she made a
small sound that was supposed to be laughter  it did sound jagged  dentate 
 i was going to say i ve thought sometimes before like the feeling maybe had to do with hope  
 hope  
her arms had been crossed over her breasts the whole time  and though the room was overheated the patient rubbed each
palm continually over her upper arms  behavior one associates with chill  the position and movement shielded her inner arms
from view  the doctor s eyebrows had gone synclinal from puzzlement without his awareness 
 bob  
 bob   the doctor was anxious that his failure to have any idea what the girl was referring to would betray itself and
accentuate her feelings of loneliness and psychic pain  classic unipolars were usually tormented by the conviction that no one else
could hear or understand them when they tried to communicate  hence jokes  sarcasm  the psychopathology of unconscious armrubbing 
kate gompert s head was rolling like a blind person s   jesus what am i doing here  bob hope  dope  sinse  stick  grass 
smoke   she made a quick dubois gesture with thumb and finger held to rounded lips  the dealers down where i buy it some of
them make you call it bob hope when you call  in case anybody s accessed the line  you re supposed to ask is bob in town  and if
they have some they say  hope springs eternal   usually  it s like a code  one kid makes you ask him to please commit a crime 
the dealers that stay around any length of time tend to be on the paranoid side  as if it would fool anybody who knew enough to

 bother to access the band on the call   she seemed decidedly more animated   and one particular guy with snakes in a tank in a
trailer in allston  he   
 so drugs  then  you re saying you feel may be a factor   the doctor interrupted 
the depressed young woman s face emptied once more  she engaged briefly in something the staffers on specials called the
thousand meter stare 
 not  drugs     she said slowly  the doctor smelled shame in the room  sour and uremic  her face had become distantly pained
now 
the girl said   stopping  
the doctor felt comfortable saying once again that he was not sure he understood what she was trying to share with him 
she now went through a series of expressions that made it clinically impossible for the doctor to determine whether or not she
was entirely sincere  she looked either pained or trying somehow to suppress hilarity  she said  i don t know if you ll believe me 
i m worried you ll think i m crazy  i have this thing with pot  
 meaning marijuana  
the doctor was oddly sure that kate gompert pretended to sniff instead of engaging in a real sniff   marijuana  most people
think of marijuana as just some minor substance  i know  just like this natural plant that happens to make you feel good the way
poison oak makes you itch  and if you say you re in trouble with hope   people ll just laugh  because there s much worse drugs
out there  believe me i know  
 i m not laughing at you  katherine   the doctor said  and meant it 
 but i love it so much  sometimes it s like the center of my life  it does something to me  i know  that s not good  and i got
told point blank not to smoke  on the parnate  because dr  garton said no one knew what certain combinations do yet and it d be
roulette  but after a while i always think to myself it s been a while and things will be different somehow this time if i do  even on
the parnate  so i do again  i start again  i ll start out doing just like a couple of hits off a dubois after work  to get me through
dinner  because dinner with my mother and me is   well  but and pretty soon after a while i m in my room with the fan pointed
out the window all night  doing one hitters and exhaling at the fan  to kill the smell  and i make her say i m not there if anybody
calls  and i lie about what i m doing in there all night even if she doesn t ask  sometimes she asks and sometimes she doesn t  and
then after a while i m smoking joints at work  at breaks  going in the bathroom and standing on the toilet and blowing it out the
window  there s this tiny window up high with the glass frosted and all filthy and cobwebby  and i hate having my face up next to
it  but if i clean it off i m afraid mrs  diggs or somebody will be able to tell somebody s been doing something up around the
window  standing there in high heels on the rim of the toilet  brushing my teeth all the time and using up collyrium     by the
bottleful and switching the console to audio and always needing more water before i answer the console because my mouth s too
dry to talk  especially on the parnate  the parnate makes my mouth dry anyways  and pretty soon i m totally paranoid they know
i m stoned  at work  sitting there in the office  high  reeking and i m the only one that can t tell i reek  i m like so obsessed with do
they know  can they tell  and then after a while i m having my mother call in sick for me so i can stay home after she goes in to
work and have the whole place to myself with nobody to worry about do they know  and smoke out the fan  and spray lysol all
over and stir ginger s litter box around so the whole place reeks of ginger  and smoke and draw and watch terrible daytime stuff
on the tp because i don t want my mother to see any cartridge orders on days i m supposed to be in bed sick  i start to get obsessed with does she know  i m getting more and more miserable and fed up with myself for smoking so much  this is after a
couple weeks of it  is all  and i start getting high and thinking about nothing except how i have to quit smoking all this bob so i
can get back to work and start saying i m here when people call  so i can start living some kind of damn life instead of just sitting
around in pajamas pretending i m sick like a third grader and smoking and watching tp again  and so after i ve smoked the last of
whatever i ve got i always say no more  this is it  and i throw out my papers and my one hitter  i ve probably thrown about fifty
one hitters in dumpsters  including some nice wood and brass ones  including a couple from brazil  the land barge guys must go
through our sector s dumpster once a day looking to get another good one hitter  and anyways i quit  i do stop  i get sick of it  i
don t like what it does to me  and i go back to work and work my fanny off  to make up for the last couple weeks and get a leg up
on like building momentum for a whole new start  you know  
the young woman s face and eyes were going through a number of ranges of affective configurations  with all of them
seeming inexplicably at gut level somehow blank and maybe not entirely sincere 
 and so   she said   but then i quit  and a couple of weeks after i ve smoked a lot and finally stopped and quit and gone back to
really living  after a couple of weeks this feeling always starts creeping in  just creeping in a little at the edges at first  like first
thing in the morning when i get up  or waiting for the t to go home  after work  for supper  and i try to deny it  the feeling  ignore
it  because i fear it more than anything  
 the feeling you re describing  that starts creeping in  
kate gompert finally took a real breath   and then but no matter what i do it gets worse and worse  it s there more and more 
this filter drops down  and the feeling makes the fear of the feeling way worse  and after a couple weeks it s there all the time  the
feeling  and i m totally inside it  i m in it and everything has to pass through it to get in  and i don t want to smoke any bob  and i
don t want to work  or go out  or read  or watch tp  or go out  or stay in  or either do anything or not do anything  i don t want
anything except for the feeling to go away  but it doesn t  part of the feeling is being like willing to do anything to make it go
away  understand that  anything  do you understand  it s not wanting to hurt myself it s wanting to not hurt  
the doctor hadn t even pretended to try to take notes on all this  he couldn t keep himself from trying to determine whether
the ambient blank insincerity the patient seemed to project during what appeared  clinically  to be a significant gamble and move
toward trust and self revealing was in fact projected by the patient or was somehow counter transferred or  projected onto the
patient from the doctor s own psyche out of some sort of anxiety over the critical therapeutic possibilities her revelation of concern
over drug use might represent  the time this thinking required looked like sober and thoughtful consideration of what kate
gompert said  she was again gazing at her feet s interactions with the empty boating sneakers  her face moving between
expressions associated with grief and suffering  none of the clinical literature the doctor had read for his psych rotation suggested
any relation between unipolar episodes and withdrawal from cannabinoids 

  so this has happened in the past  prior to your other hospitalizations  then  katherine  
her face  foreshortened by its downward angle  was working in the spread  writhing configurations of weeping  but no tears
emerged   i just want you to shock me  just get me out of this  i ll do anything you want  
 have you explored this possible connection between your cannabis use and your depressions with your regular therapist 
katherine  
she did not respond directly as such  her associations began to loosen  in the doctor s opinion  as her face continued to work
dryly 
 i had shock before and it got me out of this  straps  nurses with their sneakers in little green bags  anti saliva injections 
rubber thing for your tongue  general  just some headaches  i didn t mind it at all  i know everybody thinks it s horrible  that old
cartridge  nichols and the big indian  distortion  they give you a general here  right  they put you under  it s not that bad  i ll go
willingly  
the doctor was summarizing her choice of treatment option  as was her right  on her chart  he had extremely good
penmanship for a doctor  he put her get me out of this in quotation marks  he was adding his own post assessment question  then
what   when kate gompert began weeping for real 
and just before ol  h  on   april y d a u   his wife arrived back home and uncovered her hair and came in and saw the
near eastern medical attache and his face and tray and eyes and the soiled condition of his special recliner  and rushed to his side
crying his name aloud  touching his head  trying to get a response  failing to get any response to her  he still staring straight ahead 
and eventually and naturally she   noting that the expression on his rictus of a face nevertheless appeared very positive  ecstatic 
even  you could say   she eventually and naturally turning her head and following his line of sight to the cartridge viewer 
gerhardt schtitt  head coach and athletic director at the enfield tennis academy  enfield ma  was wooed fiercely by
e t a  headmaster dr  james incandenza  just about begged to come on board the moment the academy s hilltop was shaved flat
and the place was up and running  incandenza had decided he was going to bring schtitt on board or bust   this even though
schtitt had then just lately been asked to resign from the staff of a nick bollettieri camp in sarasota because of a really
unfortunate incident involving a riding crop 
by now  though  pretty much everybody now at e t a  feels as though stories about schtitt s whole corporal punitive thing
must have been pumped up out of all sane proportion  because even though schtitt still does favor those high and shiny black
boots  and yes the epaulets  still  and now a weatherman s telescoping pointer that s a clear stand in for the now forbidden old
riding crop  he has  schtitt  at near what must be seventy  mellowed to the sort of elder statesman point where he s become mostly
a dispenser of abstractions rather than discipline  a philosopher instead of a king  his felt presence is here mostly verbal  the
weatherman s pointer has not made corrective contact with even one athletic bottom in schtitt s whole nine years at e t a 
still  although he now has all these lebensgefahrtins     and prorectors to administer most of the necessary little characterbuilding cruelties  schtitt does like his occasional bit of fun  still 
so but when schtitt dons the leather helmet and goggles and revs up the old f r g  era bmw cycle and trails the sweating
e t a  squads up the comm  ave  hills into east newton on their p m  conditioning runs  making judicious use of his pea shooter
to discourage straggling sluggards  it s usually eighteen year old mario incandenza who gets to ride along in the sidecar  carefully
braced and strapped  the wind blowing his thin hair straight back off his oversized head  beaming and waving his claw at people
he knows  it s possibly odd that the leptosomatic mario i   so damaged he can t even grip a stick  much less flail at a moving ball
with one  is the one kid at e t a  whose company schtitt seeks out  is in fact pretty much the one person with whom schtitt
speaks candidly  lets his pedagogical hair down  he s not close to his prorectors  particularly  schtitt  and treats aubrey delint and
mary esther thode with a formality that s almost parodic  but often of a warm evening sometimes mario and coach schtitt will
find themselves out alone under the east courts  canvas pavilion or the towering copper beech west of comm  ad   or at one of
the initial scarred redwood picnic tables off the path out behind the headmaster s house where mario s mother and uncle live 
schtitt savoring a post prandial pipe  mario enjoying the smells of the calliopsis alongside the grounds  quincunx paths  the
sweetish pines and the briers  yeasty musk coming up from the hillside s slopes  and he actually likes the sulphury odor of
schtitt s obscure austrian blend  schtitt talks  mario listens  generally  mario is basically a born listener  one of the positives to
being visibly damaged is that people can sometimes forget you re there  even when they re interfacing with you  you almost get to
eavesdrop  it s almost like they re like  if nobody s really in there  there s nothing to be shy about  that s why bullshit often tends
to drop away around damaged listeners  deep beliefs revealed  diary type private reveries indulged out loud  and  listening  the
beaming and brady kinetic boy gets to forge an interpersonal connection he knows only he can truly feel  here 
schtitt has the sort of creepy wiriness of old men who still exercise vigorously  he has surprised blue eyes and a vivid white
crewcut of the sort that looks virile and good on men who have lost a lot of hair anyway  and skin so clean sheet white it almost
glows  an evident immunity to the sun s uv  in pine shaded twilight he is almost glowingly white  as if cut from the stuff of
moons  he has a way of focusing his whole self s concentration very narrowly  adjusting his legs  spread for the varicoceles and
curling one arm over the other and sort of drawing himself in around the pipe he attends to  mario can sit motionless for really
long periods  when schtitt exhales pipe smoke in different geometric shapes they both seem to study intently  when schtitt
exhales he makes little sounds variant in plosivity between p and b 
 am realizing whole myth of efficiency and no waste that is making this continent of countries we are in   he exhales   you
know myths  
 is that like a story  
 ach  a made up story  for some children  an efficiency of euclid only  flat  for flat children  straight ahead  plow ahead 
go  this is myth  
 there aren t any flat children  really  
 this myth of the competition and bestness we fight for you players here  this myth  they assume here always the efficient
way is to plow in straight  go  the story that the shortest way between two places is the straight line  yes  
 yes  
schtitt can use the stem of the pipe to point  for emphasis   but what then when something is in the way when you go between

 places  no  plow ahead  go  collide  kabong  
 willikers  
 where is their straight shortest then  yes  where is the efficiently quickly straight of euclid then  yes  and how many two
places are there without there is something in the way between them  if you go  
it can be entertaining to watch the evening pines  mosquitoes light and feed deeply on luminous schtitt  who is oblivious  the
smoke doesn t keep them away 
 when i am boyish  training to compete for best  our training facilities on a sign  very largely painted  stated we are what
we walk between  
 gosh  
it s a tradition  one stemming maybe from wimbledon s all england locker rooms  tympana  that every big time tennis
academy has its own special traditional motto on the wall in the locker rooms  some special aphoristic nugget that s supposed to
describe and inform what the academy s philosophy s all about  after mario s father dr  incandenza passed away  the new
headmaster  dr  charles tavis  a canadian citizen  either mrs  incandenza s half brother or adoptive brother  depending on the
version  c t  had taken down incandenza s founding motto   te occidere possunt sed te edere non possunt
nefas est       and had replaced it with the rather more upbeat the man who knows his limitations has
none 
mario is an enormous fan of gerhardt schtitt  whom most of the other e t a  kids regard as probably bats  and as w o doubt
mind looseningly discursive  and show the old pundit even token respect mostly because schtitt still personally oversees the daily
drill assignments and can  if aggrieved  have thode and delint make them extremely uncomfortable more or less at will  out there
in a m  practice 
one of the reasons the late james incandenza had been so terribly high on bringing schtitt to e t a  was that schtitt  like the
founder himself  who d come back to tennis  and later film  from a background in hard core math based optical science   was that
schtitt approached competitive tennis more like a pure mathematician than a technician  most jr  tennis coaches are basically
technicians  hands on practical straight ahead problem solving statistical data wonks  with maybe added knacks for short haul
psychology and motivational speaking  the point about not crunching serious stats is that schtitt had clued incandenza in  all the
way back at a b s           u s t a  convention on photoelectric line judging  that he  schtitt  knew real tennis was really about
not the blend of statistical order and expansive potential that the game s technicians revered  but in fact the opposite   not order 
limit  the places where things broke down  fragmented into beauty  that real tennis was no more reducible to delimited factors or
probability curves than chess or boxing  the two games of which it s a hybrid  in short  schtitt and the tall a e g  optics man  i e 
incandenza   whose fierce flat serve and haul ass to the net approach to the game had carried him through m i t  on a full ride w 
stipend  and whose consulting report on high speed photoelectric tracking the u s t a  mucky mucks found dense past all
comprehending  found themselves totally simpatico on tennis s exemption from stats tracking regression  were he now still
among the living  dr  incandenza would now describe tennis in the paradoxical terms of what s now called  extra linear
dynamics       and schtitt  whose knowledge of formal math is probably about equivalent to that of a taiwanese kindergartner 
nevertheless seemed to know what hopman and van der meer and bollettieri seemed not to know  that locating beauty and art and
magic and improvement and keys to excellence and victory in the prolix flux of match play is not a fractal matter of reducing
chaos to pattern  seemed intuitively to sense that it was a matter not of reduction at all  but   perversely   of expansion  the
aleatory flutter of uncontrolled  metastatic growth   each well shot ball admitting of n possible responses  n  possible responses
to those responses  and on into what incandenza would articulate to anyone who shared both his backgrounds as a cantorian    
continuum of infinities of possible move and response  cantorian and beautiful because wfoliating  contained  this diagnate
infinity of infinities of choice and execution  mathematically uncontrolled but humanly contained  bounded by the talent and
imagination of self and opponent  bent in on itself by the containing boundaries of skill and imagination that brought one player
finally down  that kept both from winning  that made it  finally  a game  these boundaries of self 
 you mean like the baselines are boundaries   mario tries to ask 
 lieber gott nein   with a plosive disgusted sound  schtitt likes best of all smoke shapes to try to blow rings  and is kind of
lousy at it  blowing mostly wobbly lavender hot dogs  which mario finds delightful 
the thing with schtitt  like most europeans of his generation  anchored from infancy to certain permanent values which  
yes  ok  granted   may  admittedly  have a whiff of proto fascist potential about them  but which do  nevertheless  the values  
anchor nicely the soul and course of a life   old world patriarchal stuff like honor and discipline and fidelity to some larger unit
  gerhardt schtitt does not so much dislike the modern o n a n ite u s  of a  as find it hilarious and frightening at the same
time  probably mostly just alien  this should not be rendered in exposition like this  but mario incandenza has a severely limited
range of verbatim recall  schtitt was educated in pre unification gymnasium under the rather kanto hegelian idea that jr 
athletics was basically just training for citizenship  that jr  athletics was about learning to sacrifice the hot narrow imperatives of
the self   the needs  the desires  the fears  the multiform cravings of the individual appetitive will   to the larger imperatives of
a team  ok  the state  and a set of delimiting rules  ok  the law   it sounds almost frighteningly simple minded  though not to
mario  across the redwood table  listening  by learning  in palestra  the virtues that pay off directly in competitive games  the welldisciplined boy begins assembling the more abstract  gratification delaying skills necessary for being a  team player  in a larger
arena  the even more subtly diffracted moral chaos of full service citizenship in a state  except schtitt says ach  but who can
imagine this training serving its purpose in an experialist and waste exporting nation that s forgotten privation and hardship and
the discipline which hardship teaches by requiring  a u s  of modern a  where the state is not a team or a code  but a sort of
sloppy intersection of desires and fears  where the only public consensus a boy must surrender to is the acknowledged primacy of
straight line pursuing this flat and short sighted idea of personal happiness 
the happy pleasure of the person alone  yes  
 except why do you let delint tie pemulis and shaw s shoes to the lines  if the lines aren t boundaries  
 without there is something bigger  nothing to contain and give the meaning  lonely  verstiegenheit      
 bless you  

  any something  the what  this is more unimportant than that there is something  
schtitt one time was telling mario  as they respectively walked and tottered down comm  ave  eastward into allston to see
about getting a gourmet ice cream someplace along there  that when he was mario s age   or maybe more like hal s age 
whatever   he  schtitt  had once fallen in love with a tree  a willow that from a certain humid twilit perspective had looked like a
mysterious woman aswirl with gauze  this certain tree in the public platz of some west german town whose name sounded to
mario like the sound of somebody strangling  schtitt reported being seriously smitten with the tree 
 i went daily to there  to be with the tree  
they respectively walked and tottered  ice cream bound  mario moving like the one of them who was truly old  mind off his
stride because he was trying to think hard about what schtitt believed  mario s thinking hard expression resembles what for
another person would be the sort of comically distorted face made to amuse an infant  he was trying to think how to articulate
some reasonable form of a question like  but then how does this surrender the personal individual wants to the larger state orbeloved tree or something stuff work in a deliberately individual sport like competitive junior tennis  where it s just you v  one
other guy 
and then also  again  still  what are those boundaries  if they re not baselines  that contain and direct its infinite expansion
inward  that make tennis like chess on the run  beautiful and infinitely dense 
schtitt s thrust  and his one great irresistible attraction in the eyes of mario s late father  the true opponent  the enfolding
boundary  is the player himself  always and only the self out there  on court  to be met  fought  brought to the table to hammer out
terms  the competing boy on the net s other side  he is not the foe  he is more the partner in the dance  he is the what is the word
excuse or occasion for meeting the self  as you are his occasion  tennis s beauty s infinite roots are self competitive  you compete
with your own limits to transcend the self in imagination and execution  disappear inside the game  break through limits 
transcend  improve  win  which is why tennis is an essentially tragic enterprise  to improve and grow as a serious junior  with
ambitions  you seek to vanquish and transcend the limited self whose limits make the game possible in the first place  it is tragic
and sad and chaotic and lovely  all life is the same  as citizens of the human state  the animating limits are within  to be killed and
mourned  over and over again 
mario thinks of a steel pole raised to double its designed height and clips his shoulder on the green steel edge of a dumpster 
pirouetting halfway to the cement before schtitt darts in to catch him  and it almost looks like they re doing a dance floor dip as
schtitt says this game the players are all at e t a  to learn  this infinite system of decisions and angles and lines mario s brothers
worked so brutishly hard to master  junior athletics is but one facet of the real gem  life s endless war against the self you cannot
live without 
schtitt then falls into the sort of silence of someone who s enjoying mentally rewinding and replaying what he just came up
with  mario thinks hard again  he s trying to think of how to articulate something like  but then is battling and vanquishing the
self the same as destroying yourself  is that like saying life is pro death  three passing allstonian street kids mock and make fun
of mario s appearance behind the pair s backs  some of mario s thinking faces are almost orgasmic  fluttery and slack  and then
but so what s the difference between tennis and suicide  life and death  the game and its own end 
it s always schtitt who ends up experimenting with some exotic icecream flavor  when they arrive  mario always chickens out
and opts for good old basic chocolate when the moment of decision at the counter comes  thinking along the lines of like better
the flavor you know for sure you already love 
 and so  no different  maybe   schtitt concedes  sitting up straight on a waffle seated aluminum chair with mario beneath an
askew umbrella that makes the flimsy little table it s rooted to shake and clank in the sidewalk s breeze   maybe no different  so  
biting hard into his tricolored cone  he feels at the side of his white jaw  where there s some sort of red welt  it looks like   not
different    looking out into the ave  s raised median at the green line train rattling past downhill    except the chance to play  
he brightens in preparation to laugh in his startling german roar  saying  no  yes  the chance to play  yes   and mario loses a
dollop of chocolate down his chin  because he has this involuntary thing where he laughs whenever anyone else does  and schtitt
is finding what he has just said very amusing indeed

there is no jolly irony in tiny ewell s name  he is tiny  an elf sized u s  male  his feet barely reach the floor of the taxi  he

returned home just before dawn from an extremely important get together with potential clients to find that his wife had had the
locks changed and filed a restraining order and would communicate with him only by notes passed through the mail slot below the
white door s black brass  the brass had been painted black  knocker  when tiny leans down and wipes at the scuff mark with a
slim thumb it only pales and smears  it is tiny s first time out of happy slippers since his second day at the detox  they took
away his florsheims after    abstinent hours had passed and he started to perhaps d t  a little  he d kept noticing mice scurrying
around his room  mice as in rodents  vermin  and when he lodged a complaint and demanded the room be fumigated at once and
then began running around hunched and pounding with the heel of a hand held florsheim at the mice as they continued to ooze
through the room s electrical outlets and scurry repulsively about  eventually a gentle faced nurse flanked by large men in
custodial whites negotiated a trade of shoes for librium  predicting that the mild sedative would fumigate what really needed to be
fumigated  they gave him slippers of green foam rubber with smiley faces embossed on the tops  the detox s in patients are

and run chilled down the wall and form a sort of cloud bank near the floor  the man s raptly amused profile appears in the mirror
on the wall beside the dresser the two in patients share  the man  like tiny ewell  has the rouged corpse look that attends detox
from late stage alcoholism  the man is in addition a burnt yellow beneath his flush  from chronic hepatitis  the mirror he appears
in is treated with shatterproof lucite polymers  the man leans carefully forward with the plate of brownies in his lap and changes
the setting on the air conditioner from   to   and then to    then    scanning the screen of gushing vents  he finally turns the
selector s dial all the way around to    the air conditioner roars and blows his long hair straight back  and his beard blows back
over his shoulder  ashes fly and swirl around from his plate of brownies  plus crumbs  and his rodney s tip glows cherry and gives
sparks  he is deeply engaged by whatever he sees on    he gives tiny ewell the screaming meemies  ewell has complained  he
wears pisscatchers  a striped cotton st  mel s robe  and a pair of glasses missing one lens  he has been watching the air conditioner
all day  his face produces the little smiles and grimaces of a person who s being thoroughly entertained 
when the big black rehabilitative staffer placed tiny ewell in the taxi and then squeezed in and told the cabbie they wanted
unit    in the enfield marine va hospital complex just off commonwealth ave  in enfield  the cabbie  whose photo was on the
mass  livery license taped to the glove compartment  the cabbie  looking back and down at little tiny ewell s neat white beard
and ruddy complexion and sharp threads  had scratched under his skallycap and asked if he was sick or something 
tiny ewell had said   so it would seem  
by mid afternoon on   april y d a u   the near eastern medical attache  his devout wife  the saudi prince q          s
personal physician s personal assistant  who d been sent over to see why the medical attache hadn t appeared at the back bay
hilton in the a m  and then hadn t answered his beeper s page  the personal physician himself  who d come to see why his personal
assistant hadn t come back  two embassy security guards w  sidearms  who d been dispatched by a candidiatic  heartily pissed off
prince q           and two neatly groomed seventh day adventist pamphleteers who d seen human heads through the living room
window and found the front door unlocked and come in with all good spiritual intentions   all were watching the recursive loop
the medical attache had rigged on the tp s viewer the night before  sitting and standing there very still and attentive  looking not
one bit distressed or in any way displeased  even though the room smelled very bad indeed 

   april   year of the depend adult undergarment
he sat alone above the desert  redly backlit and framed in shale  watching very yellow payloaders crawl over the beaten dirt
of some u s a  construction site several km  to the southeast  the outcropping s height allowed him  marathe  to look out over
most of u s a  area code       his shadow did not yet reach the downtown regions of the city tucson  not yet quite  of sounds in
the arid hush were only a faint and occasional hot wind  the blurred sound of the wings of sometimes an insect  some tentative
trickling of loosened grit and small stones moving farther down the upslope behind 
and as well the sunset over the foothills and mountains behind him  such a difference from the watery and somehow sad
spring sunsets of southwestern quebec s papineau regions  where his wife had need of care  this  the sunset  more resembled an
explosion  it took place above and behind him  and he turned some of the time to regard it  it  the sunset  was swollen and
perfectly round  and large  radiating knives of light when he squinted  it hung and trembled slightly like a viscous drop about to
fall  it hung just above the peaks of the tortolita foothills behind him  marathe   and slowly was sinking 
marathe sat alone and blanket lapped in his customized fauteuil de roll ent    on a kind of outcropping or shelf about
halfway up  waiting  amusing himself with his shadow  as the lowering light from behind came at an angle more and more acute 
goethe s well known  brockengespensf phenomenon     enlarged and distended his seated shadow far out overland  so that the
spokes of his chair s rear wheels cast over two whole counties below gigantic asterisk shadows  whose fine black radial lines he
could cause to move by playing slightly with the wheels  rubber rims  and his head s shadow brought to much of the suburb west
tucson a premature dusk 
he appeared to remain concentrated on his huge shadow play as gravel and then also breath sounded from the steep hillside
back above him  grit and dirty stones cascading onto the outcropping and gushing past his chair and off the front lip  and then the
unmistakable yelp of an individual s impact with a cactus somewhere up behind  but marathe  he had all the time without turning
watched the other man s clumsy sliding descent s own mammoth shadow  cast as far east as the rincon range just past the city
tucson  and could see the shadow rush in west toward his own as unspecified services  m  hugh steeply descended  falling twice

 and cursing in u s a  english  until the shadow collapsed nearly into marathe s monstrous own  another yelp took place as the
unspecified services field operative s fall and slide the last several meters carried him upon his bottom down onto the outcropping
and then nearly all the way out and off it  marathe having to release the machine pistol under his blanket to grab steeply s bare
arm and halt this sliding  steeply s skirt was pulled obscenely up and his hosiery full of runs and stubs of thorns  the operative sat
at marathe s feet  glowing redly in the backlight  legs hanging over the shelf s edge  breathing with difficulty 
marathe smiled and released the operative s arm   stealth becomes you   he said 
 go shit in your chapeau   steeply wheezed  bring up his legs to survey the hosiery s damage 
they spoke for the most part u s a  english when they met like this  covertly  in the field  m  fortier     had wished
marathe to require that they interface always in quebecois french  as for a small symbolic concession to the a f r  on the part of
the office of unspecified services  which the quebecois seperatiste left referred to always as b s s   the  bureau des services
sans specificite  
marathe watched a column of shadow spread again out east over the desert s floor as steeply got a hand under himself and
rose  a huge and well fed figure tottering on heels  the two men sent together a strange brockengespenst shndow out toward the
city tucson  a shadow round and radial at the base and jagged at the top  from steeply s wig becoming uncombed in his descent 
steeply s gigantic prosthetic breasts pointed in wildly different directions now  one nearly at the empty sky  the matte curtain of
sunset s true dusk shadow was moving itself very slowly in across the rin cons and sonora desert east of the city tucson  still
many km  from obscuring their own large shadow 
but once marathe had committed not just to pretend to betray his assassins des fauteuils rollents in order to secure advanced
medical care for the medical needs of his wife  but to in truth do this   betray  perfidiously  now pretending only to m  fortier
and his a f r  superiors that he was merely pretending to feed some betraying information to b s s        once this decision 
marathe was without all power  served now at the pleasures of the power of steeply and the b s s  of hugh steeply  and now they
spoke mostly the u s a  english of steeply s preference 
in fact  steeply s quebecois was better than marathe s english  but c etait la guerre  as one says 
marathe sniffed slightly   thus  so  we now are both here   he wore a windbreaker and did not perspire 
steeply s eyes were luridly made up  the rear area of his dress was dirty  some of his makeup had started to run  he was
forming a type of salute to shade his eyes and looking upward behind them at what remained of the explosive and trembling sun 
 how in god s name did you get up here  
marathe slowly shrugged  as usual  he appeared to steeply as if he were half asleep  he ignored the question and said only 
shrugging   my time is finite  
steeply had also with him a woman s handbag or purse   and the wife   he said  gazing upward as yet   how s the wife doing  
 holding her own weight  thank you   marathe said  his tone of his voice betrayed nothing   and so thus what is it your
offices believe they wish to know  
steeply tottered on a leg as he removed one shoe and poured from it grit 
 nothing terribly surprising  a bit of razzle dazzle up northeast in your so called ops area  certainly you heard  
marathe sniffed  a large odor of inexpensive and high alcohol perfume came not from steeply s person but from his handbag 
which failed to complement his shoes  marathe said   dazzle  
 as in a civilian type individual receives a certain item  don t tell me this is news to you guys  not on interlace pulse  this
item  arrives via normal physical mail  we re sure you heard  remy  a cartridge copy of a certain let s call it between ourselves
 the entertainment   as in in the mail  without warning or motive  out of the blue  
 from somewhere blue  
the b s s  operative had perspired also through his rouge  and his mascara had melted to become whorish   a person with no
political value to anybody except that the saudi ministry of entertainment made one the hell of a shrill stink  
 the medical attache  the specialist of digesting  you refer to   marathe shrugged again in that maddening francophone way
that can mean several things   your offices wish to ask was the entertainment s cartridge disseminated through our mechanisms  
 don t let s waste your finite time  ami old friend   steeply said   the mischief happens to occur in metropolitan boston  postal
codes route the package through the desert southwest  and we know your dissemination scheme s routing mechanism is proposed
for somewhere between phoenix and the border down here   steeply had worked hard at feminizing his expressions and gesturing 
 it would be a bit starry eyed of o u s  not to think of your distinguished cell  no  
beneath marathe s windbreaker was a sportshirt whose breast pocket was filled with many pens  he said   us  we don t have
the information on even casualties  from this blue dazzle you speak of  
steeply was trying to extract something stubborn from inside his other shoe   upwards of twenty  remy  out of commission
altogether  the attache and his wife  the wife a saudi citizen  four more raggers  all with embassy cards  couple neighbors or
something  the rest mostly police before word got to a level they could stop police from going in before they killed the power  
 local police forces  gendarmes  
 the local constabulary  
 the minions of the law of the land  
 the local constabulary were shall we say unprepared for an entertainment like this   steeply even removed and replaced his
pumps in the upright on one leg bringing other foot up behind his bottom way of a feminine u s a  woman  but he appeared
huge and bloated as a woman  not merely unattractive but inducing something like sexual despair  he said   the attache had
diplomatic status  remy  mideast  saudi  said to be close to minor members of the royal family  
marathe sniffed hard  as if congested of the nose   a puzzling   he said 
 but also a compatriot of yours  canadian citizenship  born in ottawa  to arab emigres  visa lists a residence in montreal  
 and services without specificity wishes maybe to ask were there below the surface connections that make the individual
not such a civilian  unconnected  to ask of us would the a f r  wish to make of him the example  
steeply was removing dirt from his bottom  swatting himself on the bottom  he stood more or less directly over marathe 
marathe sniffed   we have neither digestive medicals nor diplomatic entourages on any lists for action  you have personally seen

 a f r  s initial lists  nor in particular montreal civilians  we have  as one will say  larger seafood to cook  
steeply was looking out over the desert and city  also  as he swatted at himself  he seemed to have noticed the gespenstphenomenon of his own shadow  marathe for some reason pretended again to sniff the nose  the wind was moderate and constant
and of about the temperature of a u s a  clothes dryer set on low  it made the shrill whistling sounds  also sounds of the blowing
grit  weeds of tumbling like enormous hairballs rolled often across the interstate highway of i    far below  their specular
perspective  the reddening light on vast tan stone and the oncoming curtain of dusk  the further elongation of their monstrous
agnate shadows  all was almost mesmerizing  neither man seemed able to look at anything but the vista below  marathe could
simultaneously speak in english and think in french  the desert was the tawny color of the hide of the lion  their speaking
without looking at one another  facing both the same direction   this gave their conversing an air of careless intimacy  as of old
friends at the cartridge viewer together  or a long married couple  marathe thought this as he opened and closed his upheld hand 
making over the city tucson a huge and black blossom open itself and close itself 
and steeply raised his bare arms and held them out and crossed them  maybe as if signalling for distant aid  this made x s
and pedentive v s over much in the city tucson   still  remy  but born in the hated by you ottawa  this civilian attache  and
connected to a major buyer of trans grid entertainment  and follow up out of the boston offices reports possible indications of the
victim s prior possible involvement with the widow of the auteur we both know was responsible for the entertainment in the first
place  the samizdat  
 prior  
steeply produced from his handbag belgian cigarettes of a many mm  and habitually female type   film director s wife d
taught out at brandeis where the victim d done his residency  the husband was on board over at a e c   and different agencies 
background checks indicated the wife was fucking just about everything with a pulse   with the slight pause of which steeply
could excel   particularly a canadian pulse  
 involvement of sexuality is what you are meaning  then  not politics  
steeply said   this wife herself a quebecer  remy  from l islet county   chief tine says three years spent on ottawa s
 personnes qui on doit  list  there s such a thing as political sex  
 i have said to you all we know  civilians as individual warnings to o n a n  are not our desire  this is known by you  
marathe s eyes looked nearly closed   and your tits  they have become cock eyed  i will tell you  services without specificity 
they have given you ridiculous tits  and now they point differently  
steeply looked down at himself  one of the false breasts  surely false  surely they would not go as far as the hormonal 
marathe thought  nearly touched the chins of steeply when his looking down produced his double chins   i was asked to secure
personal verification  is all   he said   my general sense at the office is the brass consider the whole incident a stumper  there re
theories and countertheories  there are even antitheories positing error  mistaken identity  sick hoax   his shrugging  with his
hands on the prosthesis  appeared not at all gallic   still  twenty three human beings lost for all time  that d be some hoax  no  
marathe sniffed   asked to verify by our mutual m  tine  how you call him   rod  a god   
 rodney tine  sr   chief of unspecified services  acknowledged architect of o n a n  and continental reconfiguration  who
held the ear of the white house of u s a   and whose stenographer had long doubled as the steno grapher cum jeune fille devendredi of m  duplessis  former asst  coordinator of the pan canadian resistance  and whose passionate  ill disguised
attachment  tine s  to this double amaneunsis   one mile  luria perec  of lamartine  county l islet  quebec   gave rise to these
questions of the high level loyalties of tine  whether he  doubled      for quebec out of the love for luria or  tripled  the
loyalties  pretending only to divulge secrets while secretly maintaining his u s a  fealty against the pull of an irresistible love  it
was said  
 the  remy   it was clear that steeply could not fix his breasts  directions without pulling down severely his decolletage 
which he was shy to do  he produced from his handbag sunglasses and put on the sunglasses  they were embellished with
rhinestones and looked absurd   rod the god  
marathe forced himself to say nothing of their appearance  steeply tried with several matches to light a cigarette in the wind 
the encroachment of true dusk began to erase his wig s chaotic shadow  electric lights began to twinkle in the rincon foothills
east of the city  steeply tried somewhat to cup his body around the match  for shelter for the flame 
it s a herd of feral hamsters  a major herd  thundering across the yellow plains of the southern reaches of the great concavity
in what used to be vermont  raising dust that forms a uremic hued cloud with somatic shapes interpretable from as far away as
boston and montreal  the herd is descended from two domestic hamsters set free by a watertown ny boy at the beginning of the
experialist migration in the subsidized year of the whopper  the boy now attends college in champaign il and has forgotten that
his hamsters were named ward and june 
the noise of the herd is tornadic  locomotival  the expression on the hamsters  whiskered faces is businesslike and
implacable   it s that implacable herd expression  they thunder eastward across pedalferrous terrain that today is fallow 
denuded  to the east  dimmed by the fulvous cloud the hamsters send up  is the vivid verdant ragged outline of the annularly
overfertilized forests of what used to be central maine 
all these territories are now property of canada 
with respect to a herd of this size  please exercise the sort of common sense that come to think of it would keep your thinking
man out of the southwest concavity anyway  feral hamsters are not pets  they mean business  wide berth advised  carry nothing
even remotely vegetablish if in the path of a feral herd  if in the path of such a herd  move quickly and calmly in a direction
perpendicular to their own  if american  north not advisable  move south  calmly and in all haste  toward some border metropolis
  rome nny or glens falls nny or beverly ma  say  or those bordered points between them at which the giant protective
athscme fans atop the hugely convex protective walls of anodized lucite hold off the drooling and piss colored bank of
teratogenic concavity clouds and move the bank well back  north  away  jaggedly  over your protected head 
the heavy tongued english of steeply was even more difficult to understand with a cigarette in the mouth  he said   and
you ll of course report this little interface of you and me right back to fortier  
marathe shrugged     n sur  

 steeply got it lit  he was a large and soft man  some type of brutal u s  contact sport athlete now become fat  he appeared to
marathe to look less like a woman than a twisted parody of womanhood  electrolysis had caused patches of tiny red pimples along
his jowls and upper lip  he also held his elbow out  the arm holding the match for lighting  which is how no woman lights a
cigarette  who is used to breasts and keeps the lighting elbow in  also steeply teetered ungracefully on his pumps  heels on the
stone s uneven surface  he never for a moment turned his back completely at marathe as he stood on the lip of the outcropping 
and marathe had his chair s wheels  clamps now locked down tight and a firm grip on the machine pistol s pebbled grip  steeply s
purse was small and glossy black  and the sunglasses he wore had womanly frames with small false jewels at the temples  marathe believed that something in steeply enjoyed his grotesque appearance and craved the humiliation of the field disguises his
b s s  superiors requested of him 
steeply now looked at him  in probability  behind the dark glasses   and also that i just right now asked you if you d report it 
and that you said bien sur  
marathe s laugh had this misfortune to sound false and overhearty  whether or not sincere  he made a mustache of his finger 
pretending for some reason to stifle a need to sneeze   you verify this because of why  
steeply scratched under the hem of his blonde wig with  stupidly  dangerously  the thumb of his hand that held the cigarette 
 well you are already tripling  remy  aren t you  or would it be quadrupling  we know fortier and the a f r  know you re here
with me now  
 but do my brothers on wheels know that you are knowing this  that they have sent me to pretend i double  
marathe s sidearm  a sterling ul     mm machine pistol with a mag na port silencer  did not have a safety  its fat and
texture of pebbles grip was hot from marathe s palm  and in turn caused marathe s palm to perspire beneath the blanket  from
steeply there merely was silence 
marathe said         have i merely pretended to pretend to pretend to betray      
and the desert u s a  s light had become now sad  more than half the round sun gone behind the tortolitas  only now the
chair s wheels and steeply s thick legs cast shadows below the dusk line  and these shadows were becoming squat and retreating
back up toward the two men 
steeply did a brief pretend charleston  playing with his legs  shadows   nothing personal  you know that  it s the obsessive
caution  who was it   who once said we get paid to drive ourselves crazy  the caution thing  you guys and tine   your
duplessis always suspected he tried to hold back on the information he passed sexually to luria  
marathe shrugged hard   and abruptly m  duplessis has now passed away from life  under circumstances of almost
ridiculous suspicion   again with the false sounding laugh   an inept burglary and grippe indeed  
both men were silent  steeply s left arm had on it a nasty mesquite scratch  marathe could observe 
marathe finally glanced at his watch  its dial illuminated in his body s shadow  both men s shadows were now climbing the
steep incline  returning up to them   me  i think that we go about our affairs in a more simple manner than your b s s  office  if m 
tine s betrayal were incomplete  we of quebec would be aware  
 because of luria  
marathe pretended to fuss with his blanket  rearranging it   but yes  the caution  luria would be aware  
steeply stepped gingerly up to the edge and tossed out his cigarette s stub  the wind caught the stub and it soared slightly
upward from his hand  moving east  both men were silent until the butt fell and hit the dark mountainside off below them  a tiny
bloom of orange  their silence then became contemplative  something tight in the air between them loosened  marathe no longer
felt the sun on his skull  dusk settled about them  steeply had found his triceps  scratch and twisted the flesh of his arm to examine
it  his rouged lips rounded with concern

wanting to remain a trustworthy confidential shoulder and wing for their little buddies  most private and delicate issues 
though he  too  has to struggle with a strange urge to be cruel to inger soll  who reminds him of someone he dislikes but can t
quite place  hal on the whole rather likes being a big b  he likes being there to come to  and likes delivering little unpretentious
minilectures on tennis theory and e t a  pedagogy and tradition  and getting to be kind in a way that costs him nothing 
sometimes he finds out he believes something that he doesn t even know he believed until it exits his mouth in front of five
anxious little hairless plump trusting clueless faces  the twice weekly  more like once weekly  as things usually pan out  group

 tired   ortho slice again sighs  he pronounces it  tard   to a man  now  the upperclassmen are down slumped on the locker
room s blue crush carpet  their legs straight out in front of them  toes pointing out at that distinctive morgue angle  their backs up
against the blue steel of the lockers  careful to avoid the six sharp little louvered antimildew vents at each locker s base  all of
them look a bit silly naked because of their tennis tans  legs and arms the deep sienna of a quality catcher s mitt  from the summer 
the tan just now this late starting to fade  but feet and ankles of toadbelly white  the white of the grave  with chests and shoulders
and upper arms more like off white   the players can sit shirtless in the stands at tournaments when they re not playing and get at
least a bit of thoracic sun  the faces are the worst  maybe  most red and shiny  some still deep peeling from three straight weeks of
outdoor tournaments in august september  besides hal  who s atavistically dark complected anyway  the ones here with the least
bad piebald coloring are the players who can tolerate spraying themselves down with lemon pledge before outdoor play  it turns
out lemon pledge  when it s applied in pre play stasis and allowed to dry to a thin crust  is a phenomenal sunscreen  uv rating
like      and the only stuff anywhere that can survive a three set sweat  no one knows what jr  player at what academy found this
out about pledge  years back  or how  rather bizarre discovery circumstances are envisioned  the smell of sweat wet pledge out
on the court makes some of the more delicately constituted kids sick  though  others feel sunscreen of any kind to be
unconscionably pussified  like white visors or on court sunglasses  so most of the e t a  upperclassmen have these vivid shoeand shirt tans that give them the classic look of bodies hastily assembled from different bodies  parts  especially when you throw
in the heavily muscled legs and usually shallow chests and the two arms of different sizes

 but not pleasantly high   troeltsch says 
 it d be a pleasanter tiredness high if i didn t have to wait till fucking      to start all this studyin    stice says 
 you d think schtitt could at least not turn up the juice the week before midterms  
 you d think that the coaches and the teachers could try and get together on their scheduling  
 it d be like a pleasant fatigue if i could just go up after dinner and hunker on down with the mind in neutral and watch
something uncomplex  
 not have to worry about prescriptive forms or acutance  
 kick back  
 watch something with chase scenes and lots of stuff blowing up all over the place

a curled bit of cloudy old pledge husk and a green thread from a strip of gauzetex wrap are complexly entwined in the blue
fibers of the carpet near hal s left ankle  which ankle is faintly swollen and has a blue tinge  he keeps flexing the ankle whenever
it occurs to him to  struck and troeltsch spar briefly with open hands  feinting and bobbing their heads  both still seated on the

schacht s thigh  when ted d sat down  hal s face s reflection just fits inside one of the wall tiles opposite  and then if he moves his
head slowly the face distends and comes back together with an optical twang in the next tile  that post shower community feeling
is dissipating  even evan ingersoll looks quickly at his watch and clears his throat  wayne and shaw have dressed and left  freer 
a major pledge devotee  is at his hair in the mirror  pemulis also rising now to get away from freer s feet and legs  freer s eyes

the feminized american stood at a slight angle to marathe upon the outcropping  he stared out at the dusk shadow they were
now inside  and as well the increasingly complicated twinkle of the u s a  city tucson  seeming slackly transfixed  steeply  in the
way vistas too large for the eye to contain transfix persons in a kind of torpid spectation 
marathe seemed on the edge of sleep 
even the voice of steeply had a different timbre inside the shadow   they say it s a great and maybe even timeless love  rod
tine s for your luria person  
marathe grunted  shifting slightly in the chair 
steeply said  the sort that gets sung about  the kind people die for and then get immortalized in song  you got your ballads 
your operas  tristan and isolde  lancelot and what s her name  agamemnon and helen  dante and beatrice  
marathe s drowsy smile continued upward to become a wince   narcissus and echo  kierkegaard and regina  kafka and that
poor girl afraid to go to the postbox for the mail  
 interesting choice of example here  the mailbox   steeply pretended to chuckle 
marathe came alert  take off your wig and be shitting inside it  hugh steeply b s s  and the ignorance of you appalls me 
agamemnon had no relation with this queen  menelaus was husband  him of sparta  and you mean paris  helen and paris  he of
troy  
steeply seemed amused in the idiotic way   paris and helen  the face that launched vessels  the horse  the gift which was not
a gift  the anonymous gift brought to the door  the sack of troy from inside  
marathe rose slightly on his stumps in the chair  showing some emotions at this steeply   i am seated here appalled at the
naivete of history of your nation  paris and helen were the excuse of the war  all the greek states in addition to the sparta of
menelaus attacked troy because troy controlled the dardanelles and charged the ruinous tolls for passage through  which the
greeks  who would like very dearly the easy sea passage for trade with the oriental east  resented with fury  it was for commerce 

 this war  the one quotes  love  one does not quote of paris for helen merely was the excuse  
steeply  genius of interviewing  sometimes affected more than usual idiocy with marathe  which he knew baited marathe 
 everything reduces itself to politics for you guys  wasn t that whole war just a song  did that war even really take place  that
anybody knows of  
 the point is that what launches vessels of war is the state and community and its interests   marathe said without heat  tiredly 
 you only wish to enjoy to pretend for yourself that the love of one woman could do this  launch so many vessels of alliance  
steeply was stroking the perimeters of the mesquite scratch  which made his shrug appear awkward   i don t think i d be so
sure  those around rod the god say the man would die twice for her  say he wouldn t have to even think about it  not just that
he d let the whole of o n a n  come down  if it came to that  but d die  
marathe sniffed   twice  
 without even having to pause and think   steeply said  stroking at his lip s electrolysistic rash in a ruminative fashion   it s the
reason most of us think he s still there  why he s still got president gentle s ear  divided loyalties are one thing  but if he does it
for love   well then you ve got a kind of tragic element that transcends the political  wouldn t you say   steeply smiled broadly
down at marathe 
marathe s own betrayal of a f r   for medical care for the conditions of his wife  for  steeply might imagine to think  love of
a person  a woman   tragic saying as if rodney tine of nonspecificity were not responsible for choosing it  as the insane are not
responsible   said marathe quietly 
steeply now was smiling even more broadly   it has a kind of tragic quality  timeless  musical  that how could gentle resist  
marathe s tone now became derisive despite his legendary sangfroid in matters of technical interviews   these sentiments
from a person who allows them to place him in the field as an enormous girl with tits at the cock eyed angle  now discoursing on
tragic love  
steeply  impassive and slackly ruminative  picked at the lipstick of the corner of his mouth with a littlest finger  removing
some grain of grit  gazing out from their shelf of stone   but sure  the fanatically patriotic wheelchair assassins of southern
quebec scorn this type of interpersonal sentiment between people   looking now down at marathe   no  even though it s just this
that has brought you tine  yours for luria to command  should it ever come to that  
marathe had settled back on his bottom in the chair   your u s a  word for fanatic   fanatic   do they teach you it comes from
the latin for  temple   it is meaning  literally   worshipper at the temple  
 oh jesus now here we go again   steeply said 
 as  if you will give the permission  does this love you speak of  m  tine s grand love  it means only the attachment  tine is
attached  fanatically  our attachments are our temple  what we worship  no  what we give ourselves to  what we invest with
faith  
steeply made motions of weary familiarity   herrrrrre we go  
marathe ignored this   are we not all of us fanatics  i say only what you of the u s a  only pretend you do not know 
attachments are of great seriousness  choose your attachments carefully  choose your temple of fanaticism with great care  what
you wish to sing of as tragic love is an attachment not carefully chosen  die for one person  this is a craziness  persons change 
leave  die  become ill  they leave  lie  go mad  have sickness  betray you  die  your nation outlives you  a cause outlives you  
 how are your wife and kids doing  up there  by the way  
 you u s a  s do not seem to believe you may each choose what to die for  love of a woman  the sexual  it bends back in on
the self  makes you narrow  maybe crazy  choose with care  love of your nation  your country and people  it enlarges the heart 
something bigger than the self  
steeply laid a hand between his misdirected breasts   ohh       can ada      
marathe leaned again forward on his stumps   make amusement all you wish  but choose with care  you are what you love 
no  you are  completely and only  what you would die for without  as you say  the thinking twice  you  m  hugh steeply  you
would die without thinking for what  
the a f r  s extensive file on steeply included mention of his recent divorce  marathe already had informed steeply of the
existence of this file  he wondered how badly steeply doubted what he reported  marathe  or whether he assumed its truth simply 
though the persona of him changed  steeply s car for all field assignments was this green sedan subsidized by a painful ad for
aspirin upon its side   the file knew this stupidity   marathe was sure the sedan with its aspirin advertisement was somewhere
below them  unseen  the fanatically beloved car of m  hugh steeply  steeply was watching or gazing at the darkness of the desert
floor  he did not respond  his expression of boredom could be real or tactical  either of these 
marathe said   this  is it not the choice of the most supreme importance  who teaches your u s a  children how to choose
their temple  what to love enough not to think two times  
 this from a man who   
marathe was willing that his voice not rise   for this choice determines all else  no  all other of our you say free choices
follow from this  what is our temple  what is the temple  thus  for u s a  s  what is it  when you fear that you must protect them
from themselves  if wicked quebecers conspire to bring the entertainment into their warm homes  
steeply s face had assumed the openly twisted sneering expression which he knew well quebecers found repellent on
americans   but you assume it s always choice  conscious  decision  this isn t just a little naive  remy  you sit down with your
little accountant s ledger and soberly decide what to love  always  
 the alternatives are   
 what if sometimes there is no choice about what to love  what if the temple comes to mohammed  what if you just love 
without deciding  you just do  you see her and in that instant are lost to sober account keeping and cannot choose but to love  
marathe s sniff held disdain   then in such a case your temple is self and sentiment  then in such an instance you are a fanatic
of desire  a slave to your individual subjective narrow self s sentiments  a citizen of nothing  you become a citizen of nothing 
you are by yourself and alone  kneeling to yourself  
a silence ensued this 

 marathe shifted in his chair   in a case such as this you become the slave who believes he is free  the most pathetic of
bondage  not tragic  no songs  you believe you would die twice for another but in truth would die only for your alone self  its
sentiment  
another silence ensued  steeply  who had made his early career with unspecified services conducting technical
interviews      used silent pauses as integral parts of his techniques of interface  here it defused marathe  marathe felt the ironies
of his position  one strap of steeply s prostheses  brassiere had slipped into view below his shoulder  where it cut deeply into his
flesh of the upper arm  the air smelled faintly of creosote  but much less strongly smelling than the ties of train tracks  which
marathe had smelled at close range  steeply s back was broad and soft  marathe eventually said 
 you in such a case have nothing  you stand on nothing  nothing of ground or rock beneath your feet  you fall  you blow
here and there  how does one say   tragically  unvoluntarily  lost  
another silence ensued  steeply farted mildly  marathe shrugged  the b s s  field operative steeply may not have been truly
sneering  the city tucson s lume appeared a bleached and ghostly white in the unhumid air  crepuscular animals rustled and
perhaps scuttled  dense and unbeautiful spider webs of the poisonous u s a  species of spider black widow were beneath the
shelf and the incline s other outcroppings  and when the wind hit certain angles in the mountainside it moaned  marathe thought
of his victory over the train that had taken his legs      he attempted in english to sing 
   ob say  land of the free    
and they both could feel this queer dry night desert chill descend with the moon s gibbous rise   a powdery wind down
below making dust to shift and cactus needles whistle  the sky s stars adjusting to the color of low flame   but were themselves
not yet chilled  even steeply s sleeveless dress  he and marathe stood and sat in the form fitting astral spacesuit of warmth their
own radiant heat produced  this is what happens in dry night climes  marathe was learning  his dying wife had never once left
southwestern quebec  les assassins des fauteuils roulents  remote embryonic dissemina tory ops base down here in southwest
u s a  seemed to him like the surface of the moon  four corrugated quonsets and kiln baked earth and air that swam and
shimmered like the area behind jet engines  empty and dirty windowed rooms  doorknobs hot to touch and hell stench inside the
empty rooms 
steeply was continuing saying nothing while he tamped down another of his long belgian cigarettes  marathe continued to
hum the u s a  song  all over the map in terms of key 
  november y d a u 
 because none of them really meant any of it   hal tells kent blott   the end of the day hatred of all the work is just part of
the work  you think schtitt and delint don t know we re going to sit in there together after showers and bitch  it s all planned out 
the bitchers and moaners in there are just doing what s expected  
 but i look at these guys that ve been here six  seven years  eight years  still suffering  hurt  beat up  so tired  just like i feel
tired and suffer  i feel this what  dread  this dread  i see seven or eight years of unhappiness every day and day after day of
tiredness and stress and suffering stretching ahead  and for what  for a chance at a like a pro career that i m starting to get this
dready feeling a career in the show means even more suffering  if i m skele tally stressed from all the grueling here by the time i

blott s on his back on the shag carpet   all five of them are   stretched out splay limbed with their heads up supported on
double width velourish throw pillows on the floor of v r    one of the three little viewing rooms on the second floor of the
comm  ad  bldg   two flights up from the locker rooms and three from the main tunnel s mouth  the room s new cartridge viewer
is huge and almost painfully high definition  it hangs flat on the north wall like a large painting  it runs off a refrigerated chip  the
room s got no tp or phone console  it s very specialized  just a player and viewer  and tapes  the cartridge player sits on the

tired  he s killed the volume  so you can t hear the reinforcing mantra  but the picture is bright and bell clear  it s like the picture
almost leaps out at you  a graying and somewhat ravaged looking stan smith in anachronistic white is at a court s baseline hitting
textbook forehands  over and over again  the same stroke  his back sort of osteoporotically hunched but his form immaculate  his
footwork textbook and effortless   the frictionless pivot and back set of weight  the anachronistic wilson wood stick back and
pointing straight to the fence behind him  the fluid transfer of weight to the front foot as the ball comes in  the contact at waistlevel and just out front  the front leg s muscles bunching up as the back leg s settle  eyes glued to the yellow ball in the center of
his strings  stencilled w   e t a  kids are conditioned to watch not just the ball but the ball s rotating seams  to read the spin
coming in   the front knee dipping slightly down under bulging quads as the weight flows more forward  the back foot up almost
en pointe on the gleaming sneaker s unscuffed toe  the no nonsense flourishless follow through so the stick ends up just in front of
his gaunt face   smith s cheeks have hollowed as he s aged  his face has collapsed at the sides  his eyes seem to bulge from the
cheekbones that protrude as he inhales after impact  he looks desiccated  aged in hot light  performing the same motions over and
over  for decades  his other hand floating up gently to grasp the stick s throat out in front of the face so he s flowed back into the
ready stance all over again  no wasted motion  egoless strokes  no flourishes or tics or excesses of wrist  over and over  each
forehand melting into the next  a loop  it s hypnotizing  it s supposed to be  the soundtrack says  don t think just see don t know
just flow  over and over  if you turn it up  you re supposed to pretend it s you on the bell clear screen with the fluid and egoless
strokes  you re supposed to disappear into the loop and then carry that disappearance out with you  to play  the kids re lying there

travel and cash prizes and endorsements and appearance fees  match highlights in video mags  action photos in glossy print mags 
 but they know and we know one very top junior in twenty even gets all the way to the show  much less survives there long 
the rest slog around on the satellite tours or regional tours or get soft as club pros  or become lawyers or academics like everyone
else   hal says softly 
 then they stay and suffer to get a scholarship  a college ride  a white cardigan with a letter  girl coeds keen on lettermen  
 kent  except for wayne and pemulis not one guy in there needs any kind of scholarship  pemulis ll get a full ride anywhere
he wants  just on test scores  slice s aunts ll send him anywhere even if he doesn t want to play  and wayne s headed for the
show  he ll never do more than a year in the o n a n c a a  s   blott s father  a cutting edge e n t  oncologist  flew all over the
world removing tumors from wealthy mucous membranes  blott has a trust fund   none of that s the point and you guys know it  
 they love the game  you re going to say  
stan smith has switched to backhands 
 they sure must love something  ingersoll  but how about for a second i say that s not kent s point either  kent s point s the
misery in that room just now  k b   i ve taken part in essentially that same bitter bitchy kind of session hundreds of times with
those same guys after bad p m s  in the showers  in the sauna  at dinner  
 very much bitching also in the lavatories   arslanian says 
hal unsticks his hair from his fingers  arslanian always has a queer faint hot doggish smell about him   the point is it s
ritualistic  the bitching and moaning  even assuming they feel the way they say when they get together  the point is notice we
were all sitting there all feeling the same way together  
 the point is togetherness  
 shouldn t there be violas for this part  hal  if this is the point  
 ingersoll  i   
beak s cold weather adenoids wake him periodically  and he gurgles and his eyes roll up briefly before they level out and he
settles back  seeming to stare 
hal creatively visualizes that smith s velvety backhand is him slo mo slapping evan ingersoll into the opposite wall 
ingersoll s parents founded the rhode island version of the service where you order groceries by tp and teenagers in fleets of
station wagons bring them out to you  instead of supermarkets   what the point is is that we d all just spent three hours playing
challenges against each other in scrotum tightening cold  assailing each other  trying to take away each other s spots on the squads 
trying to defend them against each other s assaults  the system s got inequality as an axiom  we know where we stand entirely in
relation to one another  john wayne s over me  and i m over struck and shaw  who two years back were both over me but under
troeltsch and schacht  and now are over troeltsch who as of today is over freer who s substantially over schacht  who can t beat
anyone in the room except pemulis since his knee and crohn s disease got so much worse  and is barely hanging on in terms of
ranking  and is showing incredible balls just hanging on  freer beat me   and   in the quarters of the u s  clays two summers ago 
and now he s on the b squad and five slots below me  six slots if troeltsch can still beat him when they play again after that
illness default  
 i am over blott  i am over ingersoll   idris arslanian nods 
 well blott s just ten  idris  and you re under chu  who s on an odd year and is under possalthwaite  and blott s under beak
and ingersoll simply by virtue of age division  
 i know just where i stand at all times   muses ingersoll 
sybervision edits its visualization sequences with a melt filter so stan smith s follow through loops seamlessly into his
backswing for the exact same next stroke  the transitions are gauzy and dreamlike  hal struggles to hike himself up onto his
elbows 
 we re all on each other s food chain  all of us  it s an individual sport  welcome to the meaning of individual  we re each
deeply alone here  it s what we all have in common  this aloneness  
 e unibus pluram    ingersoll muses 
hal looks from face to face  ingersoll s face is completely devoid of eyebrows and is round and dustily freckled  not unlike a
mrs  clarke pancake   so how can we also be together  how can we be friends  how can ingersoll root for arslanian in idris s
singles at the port washington thing when if idris loses ingersoll gets to challenge for his spot again  
 i do not require his root  for i am ready   arslanian bares canines 
 well that s the whole point  how can we be friends  even if we all live and eat and shower and play together  how can we
keep from being     deeply alone people all jammed together  
 you re talking about community  this is a community spiel  
 i think alienation   arslanian says  rolling the profile over to signify he s talking to ingersoll   existential individuality 
frequently referred to in the west  solipsism   his upper lip goes up and down over his teeth 
hal says   in a nutshell  what we re talking about here is loneliness  
blott looks about ready to cry  beak s palsied eyes and little limb spasms signify a troubling dream  blott rubs his nose
furiously with the heel of his hand 
 i miss my dog   ingersoll concedes 
 ah   hal rolls onto one elbow to hike a finger into the air   ah  but then so notice the instant group cohesion that formed itself
around all the pissing and moaning down there why don t you  blott  you  kent  this was your question  the what looks like

 sadism  the skeletal stress  the fatigue  the suffering unites us  they want to let us sit around and bitch  together  after a bad
p m  set we all  however briefly  get to feel we have a common enemy  this is their gift to us  their medicine  nothing brings you
together like a common enemy  
 mr  delint  
 dr  tavis  schtitt  
 delint  watson  nwangi  thode  all schtitt s henchmen and henchwo men  
 i hate them   blott cries out 
 and you ve been here this long and you still think this hatred s an accident  
 purchase a clue kent blott   arslanian says 
 the large and economy size clue  blott   ingersoll chimes 
beak sits up and says  god no not with pliers   and collapses back again  again with the spit bubble 
hal is pretending incredulity   you guys haven t noticed yet the way schtitt s whole staff gets progressively more foultempered and sadistic as an important competitive week comes up  
ingersoll up on one elbow at blott   the port washington meet  i d  day  the tucson whataburger the week after  they
want us in absolute top shape  blott  
hal lies back and lets smith s ballet de se loosen his facial muscles again  staring   shit  ingersoll  we re all in top shape
already  that s not it  that s the least of it  we re off the charts  shape wise  
ingersoll   the average north american kid can t even do one pull up  according to nwangi  
arslanian points down at his own chest   twenty eight pull ups  
 the point   hal says softly   is that it s not about the physical anymore  men  the physical stuff s just pro forma  it s the heads
they re working on here  boys  day and year in and out  a whole program  it ll help your attitude to look for evidence of design 
they always give us something to hate  really hate together  as big stuff looms  the dreaded may drills during finals before the
summer tour  the post christmas crackdown before australia  the november freezathon  the snot fest  the delay in upping the
lung and getting us under cover  a common enemy    may despise k  b  freer  or   can t quite resist   evan ingersoll  or jennie
bash  but we despise schtitt s men  the double matches on top of runs  the insensitivity to exams  the repetition  the stress  the
loneliness  but we get together and bitch  all of a sudden we re giving something group expression  a community voice 
community  evan  oh they re cunning  they give themselves up to our dislike  calculate our breaking points and aim for just over
them  then send us into the locker room with an unstructured forty five before big buddy sessions  accident  random
happenstance  you guys ever see evidence of the tiniest lack of coolly calculated structure around here  
 the structure s what i hate the most of all   ingersoll says 
 they know what s going on   blott says  bouncing a little on his tailbone   they want us to get together and complain  
 oh they re cunning   ingersoll says 
hal curls himself a bit on one elbow to put in a small plug of kodiak  he can t tell whether ingersoll s being insolent  he lies
there very slack  visualizing smith pounding overheads down onto ingersoll s skull  hal some weeks back had acquiesced to
lyle s diagnosis that hal finds ingersoll   this smart soft caustic kid  with a big soft eyebrowless face and unwrinkled thumbjoints  with the runty  cuddled look of a mama s boy from way back  a quick intelligence he squanders on an insatiable need to
advance some impression of himself   that the kid so repels hal because hal sees in the kid certain parts of himself he can t or
won t accept  none of this ever occurs to hal when ingersoll s in the room  he wishes him ill 
blott and arslanian are looking at him   are you ok  
 he is tired   arslanian says 
ingersoll drums idly on his own ribcage 
hal usually gets secretly high so regularly these days this year that if by dinnertime he hasn t gotten high yet that day his
mouth begins to fill with spit   some rebound effect from b  hope s desiccating action   and his eyes start to water as if he s just
yawned  the smokeless tobacco started almost as an excuse to spit  sometimes  hal s struck by the fact that he really for the most
part believes what he s said about loneliness and the structured need for a we here  and this  together with the ingersoll repulsion
and spit flood  makes him uncomfortable again  brooding uncomfortably for a moment on why he gets off on the secrecy of
getting high in secret more than on the getting high itself  possibly  he always gets the feeling there s some clue to it on the tip of
his tongue  some mute and inaccessible part of the cortex  and then he always feels vaguely sick  scanning for it  the other thing
that happens if he doesn t do one hitters sometime before dinner is he feels slightly sick to his stomach  and it s hard to eat enough
at dinner  and then later when he does go off and get off he gets ravenous  and goes out to father   son market for candy  or else
floods his eyes with murine and heads down to the headmaster s house for another late dinner with c t  and the moms  and eats
like such a feral animal that the moms says it does something instinctively maternal in her heart good to see him pack it away  but
then he wakes before dawn with awful indigestion 
 so the suffering gets less lonely   blott prompts him 
two curves down the hall in v r    where the viewer s on the south wall and doesn t get turned on  the canadian john
wayne s got lamont chu and  sleepy t p   peterson and kieran mckenna and brian van vleck 
 he s talking about developing the concept of tennis mastery   chu tells the other three  they re on the floor indian style 
wayne standing with his back against the door  rotating his head to stretch the neck   his point is that progress towards genuine
show caliber mastery is slow  frustrating  humbling  a question of less talent than temperament  
 is this right mr  wayne  
chu says      that because you proceed toward mastery through a series of plateaus  so there s like radical improvement up to a
certain plateau and then what looks like a stall  on the plateau  with the only way to get off one of the plateaus and climb up to the
next one up ahead is with a whole lot of frustrating mindless repetitive practice and patience and hanging in there  
 plateaux   wayne says  looking at the ceiling and pushing the back of his head isometrically against the door   with an x 
plateaux  
the inactive viewer s screen is the color of way out over the atlantic looking straight down on a cold day  chu s cross legged

 posture is textbook   what john s saying is the types who don t hang in there and slog on the patient road toward mastery are
basically three  types  you ve got what he calls your despairing type  who s fine as long as he s in the quick improvement stage
before a plateau  but then he hits a plateau and sees himself seem to stall  not getting better as fast or even seeming to get a little
worse  and this type gives in to frustration and despair  because he hasn t got the humbleness and patience to hang in there and
slog  and he can t stand the time he has to put in on plateaux  and what happens  
 geronimo   the other kids yell  not quite in sync 
 he bails  right   chu says  he refers to index cards  wayne s head makes the door rattle slightly  chu says   then you ve got
your obsessive type  j w  says  so eager to plateau hop he doesn t even know the word patient  much less bumble or slog  when
he gets stalled at a plateau he tries to like will and force himself off it  by sheer force of work and drill and will and practice 
drilling and obsessively honing and working more and more  as in frantically  and he overdoes it and gets hurt  and pretty soon
he s all chronically messed up with injuries  and he hobbles around on the court still obsessively overworking  until finally he s
hardly even able to walk or swing  and his ranking plummets  until finally one p m  there s a little knock on his door and it s
delint  here for a little chat about your progress here at e t a  
 banzai  el bailo  see ya  
 then what john considers maybe the worst type  because it can cunningly masquerade as patience and humble frustration 
you ve got the complacent type  who improves radically until he hits a plateau  and is content with the radical improvement he s
made to get to the plateau  and doesn t mind staying at the plateau because it s comfortable and familiar  and he doesn t worry
about getting off it  and pretty soon you find he s designed a whole game around compensating for the weaknesses and chinks in
the armor the given plateau represents in his game  still   his whole game is based on this plateau now  and little by little  guys
he used to beat start beating him  locating the chinks of the plateau  and his rank starts to slide  but he ll say he doesn t care  he
says he s in it for the love of the game  and he always smiles but there gets to be something sort of tight and hangdog about his
smile  and he always smiles and is real nice to everybody and real good to have around but he keeps staying where he is while
other guys hop plateaux  and he gets beat more and more  but he s content  until one day there s a quiet knock at the door  
 it s delint  
 a quiet chat  
 geronzai  
van vleck looks up at wayne  who s now turned away with his hands against the door frame  shoving  one leg back 
stretching the right calf   this is your advice  mr  wayne sir  this isn t chu palming himself off as you again  
they all want to know how wayne does it     continentally in    s at just seventeen  and very likely    after the
whataburger and already getting calls from proserv agents tavis has lateral alice moore screen  wayne s the most sought after
big buddy at e t a  you have to apply for wayne as buddy by random drawing 
lamont chu and t  p  peterson are sending van vleck optical daggers as wayne turns around to stretch a hip flexor and says
he s said pretty much all he has to say 
 todder  i admire your savvy  i admire a kid s certain worldly skepticism  no matter how misplaced it is here  so even though
it fucks me on the odds  so there s now like practically no way i can come out square   m  pemulis says in v r    subdorm c 
sitting on the very edge of the divan with a few feet of beige shag between him and his four kids  all cross legged on cushions  he
says  til reward your worldly skepticism this once by letting you try it with only two  so like i ve got just two cards here  and i
hold them up  one in each hand      he stops abruptly  knocks his temple with the heel of a hand that holds a jack   whoa  what am
i thinking  we all gotta put in our fiveski here first  
otis p  lord clears his throat   the ante  
 or it s called the pot   says todd possalthwaite  laying a five on the little pile 
 jaysus i m thinking  sweet jaysus what am i getting into with these kids that speak the lingo like veteran jersey shore
croupiers  i got to be missing a widget or something   t the fuck  though  you know what i m saying  so todd man you choose just
one of the cards  we got the clubby jack and the spade queen here  and you choose       and so down they go both of them facedown  and i like swirl them around on the floor a little  not shuffle but swirl so they re in plain view the whole time  and you
follllllowwwwwwww the card you chose  around and around  which like with three cards maybe i ve got some chance you lose
track but with two  with just two

 boys  what it is is i ll tell you it s repetition  first last always  it s hearing the same motivational stuff over and over till sheer
repetitive weight makes it sink down into the gut  it s making the same pivots and lunges and strokes over and over and over
again  at you boys s age it s reps for their own sake  putting results on the back burner  why they never give anybody the boot for
insufficient progress under fourteen  it s repetitive movements and motions for their own sake  over and over until the accretive
weight of the reps sinks the movements themselves down under your like consciousness into the more nether regions  through
repetition they sink and soak into the hardware  the c p s  the machine language  the autonomical part that makes you breathe
and sweat  it s no accident they say you eat  sleep  breathe tennis here  these are autonomical  accretive means accumulating 
through sheer mindless repeated motions  the machine language of the muscles  until you can do it without thinking about it 
play  at like fourteen  give and take  they figure here  just do it  forget about is there a point  of course there s no point  the point

 of repetition is there is no point  wait until it soaks into the hardware and then see the way this frees up your head  a whole
shitload of head space you don t need for the mechanics anymore  after they ve sunk in  now the mechanics are wired in 
hardwired in  this frees the head in the remarkablest ways  just wait  you start thinking a whole different way now  playing  the
court might as well be inside you  the ball stops being a ball  the ball starts being something that you just know ought to be in the
air  spinning  this is when they start getting on you about concentration  right now of course you have to concentrate  there s no
choice  it s not wired down into the language yet  you have to think about it every time you do it  but wait till fourteen or fifteen 
then they see you as being at one of the like crucial plateaus  fifteen  tops  then the concentration and character shit starts  then
they really come after you  this is the crucial plateau where character starts to matter  focus  self consciousness  the chattering
head  the cackling voices  the choking issue  fear versus whatever isn t fear  self image  doubts  reluctances  little tight lipped
cold footed men inside your mind  cackling about fear and doubt  chinks in the mental armor  now these start to matter  thirteen
at the earliest  staff looks at a range of thirteen to fifteen  also the age of manhood rituals in various cultures  think about it 
until then  repetition  until then you might as well be machines  here  is their view  you re just going through the motions  think
about the phrase  going through the motions  wiring them into the motherboard  you guys don t know how good you ve got it
right now

of it  
 implicit this is a no linesman situation  traub  you re saying  
creepily blue eyed audern tallat kelpsa chimes in   this is early rounds  the kind they give you only two balls  honor
systems  all of a sudden there he is kertwanging on you  it happens  
 i know it happens  
traub says   whether he s outright kertwanging or just head fucking you  do you start kertwanging back  tit for tat  what do
you do  
 do we assume there s a crowd  
 early round  remote court  no witnesses  you re on your own out there  do you kertwang back  
 you do not kertwang back  you play the calls  not a word  keep smiling  if you still win  you ll have grown inside as a
person  
 if you lose  
 if you lose  you do something private and unpleasant to his water jug right before his next round  
a couple of the kids have notebooks and studious nods  struck is a prized tactician  very formal in b b  group sessions 
something scholarly and detached about him his charges often revere 
 we can discuss private water jug unpleasantness on friday   struck says  looking at his watch 
a hand raised by the violently cross eyed carl whale  age thirteen  acknowledgment from struck 
 say you have to fart  
 you re serious  mobes  aren t you  
 jim sir  say you re playing out there  and suddenly you have to fart  it feels like one of those real hot nasty pressurized ones  
 i get the picture  
now some empathic murmurs  exchanged looks  josh gopnik is nodding very intensely  struck stands very straight to the
right of the viewer  hands behind his back like an oxford don 
 i mean the kind that s real urgent   whale looks briefly around him   but that it s not impossible it s actually a need to go to the
bathroom  instead  masquerading as a fart  
now five heads are nodding  pained  urgent  clearly a vexing sub    issue  struck examines a cuticle 
 meaning defecate is what you mean  then  mobes  go to the bathroom  
gopnik looks up   carl s saying the kind where you don t know what to do  what if you think you have to fart but it s really
that you have to shit  
 as in it s a competitive situation  it s not a situation where you can go bearing down and forcing and see what happens  
 so out of caution you don t   gopnik says 
  fart   philip traub says 
 but then you ve denied yourself an urgent fart  and you re running around trying to compete with a terrible hot nasty
uncomfortable fart riding around the court inside you  
two levels down  ortho stice and his brood  the little libraryish circle of soft chairs and lamps in the warm foyer off the front

little pale there  wagen knecht  is this scary you bet your little pink personal asses it s scary  it s the big time  he ll tell you straight
the fuck out  it s about discipline and sacrifice and honor to something way bigger than your personal ass  he ll mention america 
he ll talk patriotism and don t think he won t  he ll talk about it s patriotic play that s the high road to the thing  he s not american
but i tell you straight out right here he makes me proud to be american  mein kinder  he ll say it s how to learn to be a good
american during a time  boys  when america isn t good its own self  
there s a long pause  the front door is newer than the wood around it 
 i d chew fiberglass for that old man  

 the only reason the buddies in v r   can hear the little burst of applause from the foyer is because struck won t hesitate to
pause and consider silently as long as he has to  to the kids the pauses spell dignity and integrity and the still water depth of a guy
with nine years in at three different academies  and who has to shave daily  he exhales a slow breath through rounded lips 
looking off up at the ceiling s guilloche border 
 mobes  if it s me  i let it ride  
 you let it out come what may  
 a la contraire  i let it ride around inside all day if i have to  i make an iron rule  nothing escapes my bottom during play  not
a toot or a whistle  if i play hunched over i play hunched over  i take the discomfort in the name of dignified caution  and when
it s especially bad i look up at sky between points and i say to the sky thank you sir may i have another  thank you sir may i

 now the big question of character is do we let a fluke of a probably one in a hundred lapse in concentration make us throw
up our faggy hands and go dragging characterlessly back to our dens to lick the whimpering wounds  or do we narrow our eyes
and put out the chin and say pemulis we say we say pemulis  double or nothing  when the odds remain so almost crazily stacked
in our favor today  
 so they do it on purpose   beak is asking   try to make us hate them  
limits and rituals  it s almost time for communal dinner  sometimes mrs  clarke in the kitchen lets mario ring a triangle with
a steel ladle while she rolls back the dining room doors  they make the servers wear hairnets and little ob gynish gloves  hal
could take out the plug and nip down into the tunnels  maybe not even all the way down into the pump room  be only twenty
minutes late  he s thinking in an abstract absent way about limits and rituals  listening to blott give beak his aper u  like as in is
there a clear line  a quantifiable difference between need and just strong desire  he has to sit up to spit in the wastebasket  there is
a twinge in a tooth on his mouth s left side 

mario incandenza s first and only even remotely romantic experience  thus far
in mid october y d a u   hal had invited mario for a post prandial stroll  and they were strolling the e t a  grounds
between the west courts and the hillside s tree line  hal with his gear bag  mario could sense that hal wanted to be able to go off
by himself briefly  so he contrived  mario did  to be very interested in some sort of leaf and twig ensemble off the path  and let
hal sort of melt away down the path  the whole area running along the tree line and the thickets of like shrubbery and stickery
bushes and heaven knew what all was covered with fallen leaves that were dry but had not yet quite all the way lost their color 
the leaves were underfoot  mario kind of tottered from tree to tree  pausing at each tree to rest  it was       h   not yet true
twilight  but the only thing left of the sunset was a snout just over newton  and the places under long shadows were cold  and a
certain kind of melancholy sadness was insinuating itself into the grounds  light  the staggered lamps by the paths hadn t come on
yet  however 
a lovely scent of illegally burned leaves wafting up from east newton mixed with the foody smells from the ventilator
turbines out of the back of the dining hall  two gulls were in one place in the air over the dumpsters over by the rear parking lot 
leaves crackled underfoot  the sound of mario walking in dry leaves was like  crackle crackle crackle stop  crackle crackle
crackle stop 
an empire waste displacement displacement vehicle whistled past overhead  rising in the start of its arc  its one blue alertlight atwinkle 
he was around where the tree line bulged herniatically out toward the end of the west courts  fencing  from deeper inside
the thickets on the lip of the hillside came a tremendous crackling and thrashing of underbrush and trailing willow branches  and
who should heave into unexpected view but the u s s  millicent kent  a sixteen year old out of montclair nj     singles on the
girls    s a squad and two hundred kilos if she was a kilo  southpaw  one hander off the backhand side  a serve donnie stott
likes to clock with radar  and chart  mario s filmed the u s s  millicent kent for staff analysis on several occasions  they
exchange hearty hi s  one of only a couple female e t a s with visible veins in her forearms  object of a fiercely wagered on
bench press challenge against schacht  freer  and pe tropolis kahn that m  pemulis had organized last spring  in which she d
topped kahn and freer refused to show and schacht finally beat her but doffed his cap  out for a staff ordered weightmanagement post dinner stroll  squeezing penn   s in both hands  in e t a  sweat pants and with an enormous violet bow either
scotch taped or glued to the blunt rounded top of her hair  she told mario she d just seen the strangest thing farther back deeper in
the thickets off the lip  her hair was tall and rounded off in the shape of a kind of pill  not unlike a papal hat or a british
constable s tall hat  mario said the bow looked terrific  and what a surprise to come face to face like this out here in the chill dusk 
bridget boone had said the u s s  milli cent kent s coiffure looked like a missile protruding from its silo in preparation for
launch  the last of the sun s snout was setting just over the tip of the u s s  millicent s hair  which was almost osseously hardlooking  composed of dense woven nests of reticulate fibers like a dry loofa sponge  which she said over the summer a home perm
had misfired and left her hair a system of reticulate nests  and was only now loosening up enough even to attach a bow to  mario
said that well the bow set her off to a t  was all he had to say on the matter   he hadn t literally said  chill dusk    the u s s m k 
said she d been amusing herself beating her way through one of the brambly thickets mrs  incandenza had   when she d still
spent time outdoors at all   planted to discourage part time employees from short cutting up the hillside to e t a   and had come
upon a husky vl brand telescoping tripod  new and dully silvery looking and set up on its three legs  right in the middle of the
thicket  for no visible reason and with no footprints or visible evidence of path beating anywhere around except the u s s 
millicent s own  the u s s  millicent kent stowed a tennis ball in each hip pocket and took mario s claw and said here to walk
this way and she d show him real quick  and get his like feedback on the issue  and plus have a witness when they got back and

 she told people about it  mario said the husky vi came with its own pan head and cable release  with the girl supporting him with
one hand and beating an easement through the brush with the other they proceeded deeper into the thicket on the lip  the outdoor
light was now the same hue as u s s m k  s hairbow  she said she swore to god it was around here someplace  mario said his late
dad had used a somewhat less snazzy iv model husky back in his early days of making art films  when he also used a homemade
dolly and sandbags and halogen spots instead of kliegs  several different species and types of birds were twittering 
the u s s  millicent kent told mario that off the record she d always felt he had the longest lushest prettiest lashes of any boy
on two continents  three if you counted australia  mario thanked her kindly  calling her ma am and trying to fake a southern
accent 
the u s s  millicent kent said she wasn t sure what were her old footprints from finding the thicket with the tripod and what
were their more recent footprints from trying to find the old footprints  and that she was worried because it was starting to get dark
and they might not be able to find it and then mario wouldn t believe she d seen something as batshit sounding as a gleaming
silvery tripod all set up for no reason in the middle of nowheresville 
mario said he was pretty sure that australia was a continent  walking  he came up to around the bottom of u s s  millicent s
ribcage 
mario heard crackling and thrashing from some other thicket nearby but was certain it wasn t hal  since hal very rarely made
a lot of motion noise either outside or in  
the u s s  millicent kent told mario that though she was an admittedly great player  w  an overwhelming haul ass up to thenet and loom over it like a titan game in the betty stove venus williams power game tradition  and headed for an almost
limitless future in the show  she d confide in him in private out here that she d never really loved competitive tennis  that her real
love and passion was modern interpretive dance  at which she admittedly had less unconsciously native gifts and talents to bring
to bear  but which she loved  and had spent just about all her off court time as a little girl practicing in a leotard in front of a
double width mirror in her room at home in suburban montclair nj  but that tennis was what she had limitless talent at and got
emotional strokes and tuition waiver boarding school offers in  and that she d been desperate to get into a boarding school  mario
asked if she could recall if the husky vi tripod had been the tl one with waffle gridded rubber tips on the legs and a      pan
head or the sl one with unwaffled tips and only a      pan head that swiveled in an arc instead of a full circle  the u s s 
millicent revealed that she d accepted a scholarship to e t a  at age nine for the sole reason of getting away from her father  she
referred to her father as her old man  which you can just tell she capitalizes  her mother had left home when the u s s  millicent
was only five  running off very abruptly with a man sent by what had then been called con edison to do a free home energyefficiency assessment  it had been six years since she d laid an eyeball on her old man  but to the best of her recall he was almost
three meters tall and morbidly obese  which had been why every mirror and bathtub in the house had been double width  one
older sister who d been deeply involved in synchronized swimming had got pregnant and married in high school soon after her
mother s departure 
all this time there s been more crackling and crashing off up the hillside  mario has trouble on any kind of declined grade 
some sort of bird s sitting in the top branch of a little tree and looking at them without saying anything  mario thinks suddenly of a
joke he remembers hearing michael pemulis tell 
 if two people get married in west virginia and then pull up stakes and move to massachusetts and then if they decide they
want to get a divorce  what s the biggest problem getting a divorce  
the u s s m k  says her other older sister had at just fifteen joined the ice capades of all things  and was in the back up like
chorus where the biggest artistic challenge was not bumping into people and either falling or making them fall 
 getting a divorce from your sister  because in west virginia pemulis said a lot of people who get married are brother and
sister  
 hold my hand  
 he was only joking  though  
by now the light was about the same color as the ash and clinkers in the bottom of a weber grill  the u s s  millicent kent
was leading them in a set of slightly diminishing circles  then  she said  at age eight she came home early from after school drills
at the u s t a  jr  facility in passaic nj looking forward to slipping into the old leotard and getting in some modern interpretive
dancing up in her room  only to come home suddenly and find her father wearing her leotard  which needless to say didn t fit very
well  and with the small front portion of his huge bare feet squeezed into a pair of strapless pumps mrs  kent had left behind in
her haste  in the dining room he d moved all the furniture over to the side of  in front of the really wide mirror  in a grotesquely
tiny and bulging violet leotard  capering  mario says violet s really the u s s  millicent s color  she says that was the exact creepy
word for it  capering  pirouetting and rondelling  simpering  as well  the crotch of her leotard looked like a slingshot  it was so
deformed  he hadn t heard her come in  u s s  millicent asked mario if he d ever seen a girl s yin yang before  obscene mottled
hirsute flesh had pooched and spilled out over every centimeter of the leotard s perimeter  she recalled  she d had a voluptuous
figure even at eight  she told mario  but the old man was in a whole different sized ballpark altogether  mario kept saying golly
ned  all he could think of to say  his flesh jiggled and bounced as he capered  it was repellent  she said  there was no sign of a
husky vi or any other model of tripod in any of the thickets and boscages  her literal term for it was  yin yang   but her old man
wasn t just a cross dressing transves tite  she said  it turned out they always had to be a relative s female clothes  she said she
always used to wonder why her sisters  one pieces and figure skating skirts always looked so askewly baggy and elastic shot 
since the sisters didn t exactly wear tiny little malnourished sizes themselves  the old man didn t hear her come in and he capered
and jeteed for several more minutes until she happened to catch his simpering eye in the mirror  she said  that s when she knew
she had to get away  she said  and mario s own old man s admissions lady had called out of the blue that very evening  she said 
like it had been fate  serendipity  kismet 
 yin yang   mario offered  nodding  the u s s  millicent s hand was large and hot and at the level of sogginess of a bathmat
that s been used several times in a row in quick succession 
her second oldest sister  many years later  had informed the u s s m k  that the first time anybody d had any inklings about
the old man was an episode when the older sister was very small and mrs  k  had sewed her a special costume complete with

 gold lame bow   arrow for playing cupid in the school valentine s day pageant  and the sister s school had got out early one day
after an asbestos scare and she d come unexpectedly home and found the old man in the basement rumpus room in tiny wings and
hideously distended diaper striking a pose from a rather well known titian oil in the met s high renaissance wing  and had
struggled with denial and own perceptions doubting for quite some time thereafter  until a hysterical episode during rehearsals for
an ice capades valentine s day number brought all the feelings surging up and broke the denial  and the ice capades  employee
assistance office counselling staff helped her start to work it all through 
at which point u s s  millicent stopped them in an unprickly thicket of what later turned out to be poison sumac and turned
with a strange glint in the one eye that wasn t in pine shadow and crushed mario s large head to the area just below her breasts and
said she needed to confess that mario s eyelashes and vest with extendable police lock he used for staying upright in one place had
for quite some time now driven her right around the bend with sensual feeling  what mario perceived as a sudden radical drop in
the prevailing temperature was in fact the u s s  millicent kent s sexual stimulation sucking tremendous quantities of ambient
energy out of the air surrounding them  mario s face was so squashed against the u s s  millicent s thorax that he had to contort
his mouth way out to the left to breathe  u s s m k  s hairbow became detached and fluttered down through mario s sightline like
a giant crazed violet moth  u s s m k  was trying to undo mario s corduroys but was frustrated by the complex system of snaps
and fasteners at the bottom of his police lock s velcro vest  which overlapped his trouser s own fasteners  and mario tried to
reconfigure his mouth somehow to both breathe and warn the u s s m k  that he was incredibly ticklish in the area of the
bellybutton and directly below  he could now start to hear his brother hal somewhere to the above and east  calling mario s name
at a moderate volume  the u s s  millicent kent was saying there was no way mario could be any more nervous than she was
about what was happening between them  it s true that the sounds of mario sucking air out of a severely leftward contorted mouth
could have been interpretable as the heavy breathing of sexual stimulation  it was when the u s s  millicent wrapped one arm
around his shoulder for leverage and forced her other hand up under the hem of the tight vest and then down inside the trousers
and briefs  rooting for a penis  that mario became so ticklish that he began to double up  clearing his face of u s s  millicent s
front and laughing out loud in such a distinctive high pitched way that hal had no trouble beelining right upon them 
compromised though his navigational systems were after fifteen or so secret minutes alone in the fragrant pines  mario later said it
was just like when there was a word on the tip of your tongue that try as you might you can t remember until the exact second you
stop trying  and in it pops  right into your head  it was when the three of them were walking together back up the hillside toward
the tree line s lip  not trying to do anything but get back to comm  ad  by the most direct route in the dark  that they stumbled
upon the cinematic tripod  a dully glinting tl waffle tipped husky  in the middle of what wasn t such a very tall or thick thicket at
all 

   april   year of the depend adult undergarment
steeply said  choosing boston as your ops center  after all  which to us signifies  the place of the supposed entertainment s
origin  
marathe made a gesture of being willing to take time and play along  if steeply wished it   but also the city boston u s a  has
logic  your closest city to the convexity  closest therefore to quebec  within as you say the distance of spit   his wheelchair
squeaked very slightly whenever he moved  an automobile horn somewhere between the city and themselves blew a sustained
blast  it grew always colder down on the desert floor  they could feel this  he felt gratitude for his windbreaker 
steeply flicked some ashes from his cigarette with a coarse thumb gesture that was not yet feminine   but we re not any more
sure that they actually do have copies  also  does this quote  anti  entertainment the film s director supposedly made to counter
the lethality  does it really also exist  this really could be some sort of game for you and the f l q       to hold out the promise of
the anti entertainment as a chip for concessions  as some kind of remedy or antidote  
 of this anti film that antidotes the seduction of the entertainment we have no evidence except craziness of rumors  
steeply used a technical interviewer s device of pretending to occupy himself with small physical chores of preening and
hygiene  delaying  to have marathe elaborate himself more fully  the lights of the city tucson with their movements and
twinkling made a globe of light such as on ceilings at les salles de danser in val d or  quebec  marathe s wife was dying slowly of
ventricular restenosis      he thought  die twice 
marathe said   and also why do they never send you into the field as yourself  steeply  this is to say in appearance  the last
time you were   what is it i hope to say   a negro  for almost one year  no  
u s a  persons  shrugs are always as if trying to lift a heavy thing   haitian   steeply said   i was haitian  some negroid
tendencies in the persona  maybe   marathe listened to steeply be silent  a u s a  coyote sounds more like a high strung dog  the
automobile s horn continued  sounding to the men forlorn and somehow nautical out below in the dark  the feminine manner to
examine the fingernails was to raise the whole hand s back into view instead of malely curling the nails in over the upturned palm 
marathe recalled knowing this from a very young age  steeply would pick at the corners of his lip  then for an interval change to
examining the fingernails  his silences seemed always comfortable and contained  he was a competent operative  more cold air
came  odd eddied breezes up in over the shelf from the desert s floor  puffs of sudden air as if from the turning of a volume s
pages  his bare arms had the plucked chicken look of chilled and bare skin in his grotesque sleeveless dress  marathe had not been
aware of when during the falling of night steeply had removed the absurd sunglasses  but decided the exact moment of this did
not matter for reporting every word and gesture back to m  fortier  again the coyote  and also another farther off  perhaps to
answer  the sounds were like that of a domestic dog being given low voltage  les assassins  m  fortier and m  broullime and
some others of his comrades on wheels believed remy marathe to be eidetic  near perfect in recall and detail  marathe  who could
remember several incidents of crucial observations he had failed to later recall  knew this was not true

 an oiled guru sits in yogic full lotus in spandex and tank top  he s maybe forty  he s in full lotus on top of the towel
dispenser just above the shoulder pull station in the weight room of the enfield tennis academy  enfield ma  saucers of muscle
protrude from him and run together so that he looks almost crustacean  his head gleams  his hair jet black and extravagantly
feathered  his smile could sell things  nobody knows where he comes from or why s he s allowed to stay  but he s always in there 
sitting yogic about a meter off the rubberized floor of the weight room  his tank top says transcend in silkscreen  on the back
it s got deus pro videbit in day glo orange  it s always the same tank top  sometimes the color of the spandex leggings
changes 
this guru lives off the sweat of others  literally  the fluids and salts and fatty acids  he s like a beloved nut  he s an e t a 
institution  you do like maybe some sets of benches  some leg curls  inclined abs  crunches  work up a good hot shellac of sweat 
then  if you let him lick your arms and forehead  he ll pass on to you some little nugget of fitness guru wisdom  his big one for a
long time was   and the lord said  let not the weight thou wouldst pull to thyself exceed thine own weight   his advice on
conditioning and injury prevention tends to be pretty solid  is the consensus  his tongue is little and rough but feels good  like a
kitty s  it isn t like a faggy or sexual thing  some of the girls let him  too  he s harmless as they come  he supposedly went way
back with dr  incandenza  the academy s founder  in the past 
some of the newer kids think he s a creep and want him out of there  what kind of guru wears spandex and lives off others 
perspiration  they complain  god only knows what he does in there when the weight room s closed at night  they say 
sometimes the newer kids who won t even let him near them come in and set the resistance on the shoulder pull at a weight
greater than their own weight  the guru on the towel dispenser just sits there and smiles and doesn t say anything  they hunker 
then  and grimace  and try to pull the bar down  but  like  lo  the overweighted shoulder pull becomes a chin up  up they go  their
own bodies  toward the bar they re trying to pull down  everyone should get at least one good look at the eyes of a man who finds
himself rising toward what he wants to pull down to himself  and i like how the guru on the towel dispenser doesn t laugh at
them  or even shake his head sagely on its big brown neck  he just smiles  hiding his tongue  he s like a baby  everything he sees
hits him and sinks without bubbles  he just sits there  i want to be like that  able to just sit all quiet and pull life toward me  one
forehead at a time  his name is supposedly lyle 
it was yrstruly and c and poor tony that crewed that day and everything like that  the am were wicked bright and us a bit
sick however we scored our wake ups boosting some items at a sidewalk sale in the harvard squar where it were warm upping
and the snow coming off onnings and then later poor tony ran across an old patty citizen type of his old aquaintance from like the
cape and poor tony got over and pretended like he would give a blow job on the house and we got the citizen to get in his ride
with us and crewed on him good and we got enough   off the patty type to get straightened out for true all day and crewed on him
hard and c wanted we should elemonade the patty s map for keeps and everything like that and take his ride to this understanding
slope strip shop he knows in chinatown but poor tony turns white as a shit and said by no means and put up an arguement and
everything like that and we just left the type there in his vehicle off mem dr we broke the jaw for insentive not to eat no cheese
and c insisted and was not  bdenied and took off one ear which there was a mess and everything like that and then c throws the
ear away after in a dumster so yrstrulys  like so what was the exact pernt to that like  the dumster was with the dumsters out by
steves  donuts in the enfield squar  we go back to the brighton projects to cop and roy tony was always there on his bench in
the playground in late am but now all the project nigers was awake and out in the playground and it was tense but it was day
time and everything like that and we cop half a bundle from roy tony and we go down to the library at copley where we stash
our personnel works when we crewed and went into the mensroom where there was severel works on the floor allready that early
and got straight in the stall and c and yrstruly had a beef about who shot three and who got two and we made poor tony give us
up his third bag and then but we had to cop for that nite and tomorrow am still which was xmas and had to cop in advance  its  a
never ending strugle its  a full time job to stay straight and there is no vacation for xmas at anytime  its  a fucking bitch of a life
dont  let any body get over on you diffrent  and back we go to the harvard squar however on arrival poor tony wanted he should
hang for lunch time with his red leather fags in the bow arrow and pretty much i can tolerate fags when alone but together
yrstruly i cant  fucking stand fags and yrstruly and c said fuck this shit and we screwed out and go up to the central squar where
it was cool offing and the onnings re freezing and everything like that and snowing and boosted nyquil at the cvs drug where
we go to the mop aile and employ a mophandle in tilting the mirror over the nyquil aile and boosted nyquil in cs  coat and got
messed up on nyquil and scored a bookbag off a foran slope studn type kid on the redline platform but it only had books and
disks and the diskcase was fucking plastic and into a dumster with it it goes but also at this time we come up and run into kely
vinoy that was working her corner by the dumster by cheap o records in the squar by the email place and shes  dopesick having
a conversession with eckwus and an other man and eckwus said he said stokely darkstar just got freetested again at the fenway
and confirmed a big boot     hes  got the virus for sure and purpleboy said he said dark star said how if he was going down he
didnt  give a shit and wasnt  going to give a shit if he gave some others the virus thru trancemission and the word was out about
dont  share stokely darkstars  works dont  use works off stokely darkstar no matter how sick you are even if your  dyng for it get

kely and purpleboy there man takes there   and there works and hes  the only one can give them there shots and keep kely just
this side of dopesick      for insentive for her to make him more   and everything like that  theres  nothing wurse than a pimp and
boston pimps are the wurst there    x wurse than nyc pimps that are supperst to be so hartless in nyc where yrstruly petaled
ass in the columbus squar for a time of my youth like stokely darkstar before departing for green pastures  and we had a
conversession but were  coming down and it was getting dark and snowing for a white xmas and if we didnt  crew before like
     roy tonys  nigers would be too drunk to keep them from beefing with us and thered  be a beef and everything like that if we
go to cop after      and who needs a grief so back we redline to the harvard squar and all the foran studns are in the bars and we
locate poor tony smoking hash with fags back of au bon pain and say lets roll a foran studn stuck here for xmas in the bars and
cop before      and so we all go on the ice from the frozen melted snow to the bow arrow in the squar with poor tony and

 lolasister and susan t  cheese who i fucking cant  stand and got in there and made susan t  cheese buy beers and we wait and
no studns are leaving alone to roll but a older type individual who any body could see is no studn but is legless on shots alone at
the bar fucking shatered slumped over is getting ready to depart for green pastures and poor tony tells lolasister to screw she
crews with poor tony some times but not if its  wet work and with cs  involvement its  always wet work  and yrstruly i inform
susan t  cheese she new better than not to screw as well and the older individual de parts shatered and holding onto walls in a
hiclass and promising coat for the possibility of   and pernts his old nose this way and that and everything like that thru the
bow arrow window c wipes the steam off  and has a conversession with a santaclaus ringing a big bell for the kettle and were 
like jesus its  a never ending strugle to wait and cop but after awhile finally after stifing the santaclaus we watch he picks a
direction finally at last up mass ave toward the central squar on foot  and poor tony beats it around the block to get up in front
of him around the block on the ice in his fucking heels and feather snake around his neck and gets him some how poor tony
always knows how over to the dumsters  alley by bay bank off sherman st  and yrstruly and c crew on the individual and roll
him and c messes up his older map to a large degree and we leave him in no condition to eat cheese in a snow drift of materil
under the dumster  and c again wants to siphon out a vehicle on mass av and set him on fire but he has       on his person and
then some and a coat with a fury collar and a watch we realy scored and c even gosofar to take the non studns  shoes which they
dont  fit  and in the dumster they go

not have to never ending strugle at xmas and two or more days after that if we dont  blow it on xmas eve in chinatown instead
of waiting which is a good pernt but when has any body known c to ever wait he gets dopesick faster than us and everything like
that and is all piss and vinegar for wo and starting with the shivers and with the noses  mucis all ready and everything like that
and c is not  bdenied and we say we are screwing down to chinatown and if poor tony dont  want to come he can take a like a
giant breath and hold it in the squar until we get back and well  cop for him  and poor tony says he might be a dicksucking fag
but hes  not a starry eyed  moroon 
and so offwego and everything like that with       on the orangeline  and thru a fucked up circumstances yrstruly and c
almost end up raping a older type nurse in a white nurses  uniform and coat on the train but we dont  and but poor tony seems
white and detracted on the train playng with his feather snake and says he says he seems in his mind maybe to recall an
involvment in some type deal where dr  wo might of got slightly got over on and burnt and that maybe down in chinatown we
could air on the side of low profiles and try to cop some where else except from the wos   except dr  wo is who we know  c is
wos  former aquaintance from crewing with slopes on the north shore for whity sorkin in the days of his youth  c is not
 bdenied  and so at the orangeline tstop we grab a fat cab to about two blocks from hung toys and screw out of the cab at a
light and the thing with fat cabbies is they cant  run after you and poor tony is pisser to watch tearassing it down the street in
hiheels with a feather stoal  poor tony runs right by the front of hung toys  this is by pryor agreement to wait for us low profile
down the street and yrstruly and c go in hung toys where they dont  open till      and sell tea unquot like     proof tea till all
hours and everything like that and never get inspected because dr  wo has arrangements with chinatowns  finest  xmas is
noncelebrated in chinatown  dr  wo a good thing about wo is hes  always there in hung toys at known times  here theres  all old
slope racial type ladies sitting in booths eating noddles and drinking quot tea out of white cups the size of a shotglass and
everything like that  with small slope kids tearassing it all over and older men in like jew caps and skinny beerds out of just the
middle of there chin but dr  wo is only middle aged and wears iron glasses and a tie and looks more like a banker for a slope but
he is       business and icecold all the way down for slope type comerce plus hes  connected bigtime and not to be fucked or got
over on if some body has a head left and yrstruly i cant  believe poor tony would ever take part of tryng to crew on wo who he
knows thru c in even the smallest comerce and if he did c says he sure never heard about it nor saw any of the skeet or anything
like that  and why  cs  the one that knows wo  we arranged poor tony to wait for us out side and try to be low profile  its  sub  
snow and hes  in a leather spring coat and stoal and brown wig thats  not as good as a hat and hell  freeze his low profile balls off
and c was tryng to smile and he told dr  wo we needed three bundles and dr  wo was smiling in his slope manner said the
boosting life must surely be exellent and c laughed and said most exellent cs  tight with slopes he does the talking and everything
like that  and he says were  going to lay up low profile for the xmas vacation and not crew because i had a rape type situation
from an older nurse last nite on the t and almost got pinched by the ts  finest and dr  wo nods in a special subservant manner he
uses for non slopes who hes  realy polite with but hes  a dictater to his slopes when we see him with his subservant slopes but with
us were  allike most polite and everything like conversession and its  nice but expensive but it feels nice at the time but wo
finishes his so called tea and wo goes back behind the curtains in the back of hung toys thats  a giant brightred curtain with
purple mountains or hills and clouds that are flyng snakes with leather wings that is one curtain yrstruly would want to boost for
personnel hanging use that no body that isnt  a slope and isnt  in with wo cant  never go behind it but you can see when he opens it
and goes behind the curtain it looks like merly more old slope ladies sitting on packing cases with slope writing eating more
noddles in bowls they hold about like a millmeter from their yellow maps and everything like that  slopes rarly stop shovling in

 the old noddles  stokely darkstar calls them maggoteaters and subservant slopes keep going in and out of the curtain while wos 
back there a longer than avrege time and cs  got the shivers and starting to jones and dope fiends are full of super station and he
says to yrstruly he says the fuck he says maybe what if poor tony realy did take part with burning wo and what if a slope sees
poor tony out side and is one of these slopes going in and out of the curtain maybe telling wo  like ratting out poor tony as our
aquaintance  and my muds is starting and were  jonesing super statiously over pt and wheres  wo behind the curtain and
everything like that  tryng to smile and conversession ultralow  drinking quot tea thats  like schnapps only wurse and green  and
we jones and dr  wo comes back finally at last out smiling subservantly with all the wonderful skeet three bundles in a newspaper
who could fucking read it but the pictures are of slope vips  in suits and wo sits down  and wo never sits down at the booth with
the skeet it isnt  done in his comerce  and wos  hands are folded over our skeet in the thing and wo smiling says he asks c if
weve  seen goodold poor tony or susan t  cheese around we crew with poor tony in boosting life did we not he said  c he says
pt is a fucking dicksucking fag queer and a proven cheeseater and wed  fucked up his map and cheese and lolasisters  map in a
beef and didnt  crew with fags since aprox the autum period  c is pouring mucis and tryng to smile cusually  dr  wo laughed in a
harty fashion and said exellent and wo leaned over our skeet sayng if we should happenbychance to see poor tony or them to
please give poor tony his quite best regards and wish him prosparity and a thousand blisses  and everything like that  and we
promote the newspaper of skeet and wo promotes our   and very politely outwego and i admit it yrstruly wanted we should burn
poor tony and rickytick the fuck out of chinatown but we go over down more by the china pearl place and poor tony is sortof
hunched behind a lightpoal with his gray teeth chatting in his dress and thin coat tryng to be low profile in his red coat and heels
around a million   slopes that all are subservants of wo  and later after screwing out we didnt  tell him of what wo said about
sitting down and asking about him and cheeses  blisses and we screw to the orangeline to our hot air blowergrate we use at nite at
the library behind the copley squar and we get our personnel works out from behind the brickworks behind the bush by the hot
blowergrate where we stash our works and were  eggerly into the first bundle and were  cooking up and notice poor tony doesnt 
the least bitch when yrstruly and c tie off first in line seeing as were  the ones that copped it and poor tonys  gotto wait as usal 
except i notice he doesnt  bitch even a little  normally poor tony keeps up this usal wine yrstruly learned how to not notice  but
when he doesnt  wine now that were  jonesing and the skeets  right there i notice hes  cusually looking like every place but at the
skeet which is unusal and c jonesing and with the shivers cooking up tryng to keep his lighter lit in the hot airs  wind and snow of
nite  and i admit it yrstruly i get a wicked cold inside feeling even with all this hot air from the blowergrate blowing up from
under us and making our hair blow around and tonys  feather snake pernt upword i yrstruly get a cold feeling of super station
once more  you get wicked super stations in this fucked up kindof shit life because its  a never ending chase and you get too tired
to go by much more than never ending habit and super station and everything like that so but i dont  say any thing but yrstruly i
have a cold super station about poor tony not wining while he makes like he has to cusually piss and takes a piss and the piss
steams up around the lower ares of the bush with his back turned away and isnt  looking around with interst or anything like that
you never turn your back on the skeet when its  partly your skeet which is wicked unusal which c is so eggerly dopesick he
doesnt  notice any thing past keeping the lighter lit  and so i admit it i yrstruly did yrstruly purplously let c tie off and boot up
first while i still cooked up  i did cook up unusally slow  fucking with the getting the snowmelt hot in the spoon and everything
like that yrstruly i let the lighter go out and took more time with the cotton and c had the shivers wurst of us and cooks up the
fastest and would of got it anyway  later with cs  map elemonaded poor tony later conceited admitting susan t  cheese helped a
worcester fag get over on wo for a fronted bundle in autum is why  and all three bundles wo give us in slope news was
hotshots  laced  it started the instantly c undid the belt and booted up we knew allready  yrstruly i and pt thearized it was drano
with the blue like glittershit and everything like that taken out by subservant slopes it had that drano like effect on c and
everything like that it was laced what ever it was c started with the screaming in a loud hipitch fashion instantly after he unties
and boots and downhegoes flopping with his heels pouning on the metal of the blower grate and hes  at his throat with his hands
tearing at him self in the most fucked up fashions and poor tony is hiheeling rickytick over over c zipping up sayng he screams
sweety c but and stuffing the feather snake from his necks  head in cs  mouth to shut him up from hipitch screaming in case
bostons  finest can hear involvment and blood and bloody materil is coming out cs  mouth and cs  nose and its  allover the
feathers its  a sure sign of drano  blood is and cs  eyes get beesly and bulge and hes  cryng blood into the feathers in his mouth
and tryng to hold onto my glove but cs  arms are going allover and one eye it like allofa sudden pops outof his map  like with a
pop you make with fingers in your mouth with all this blood and materil and a blue string at the back of the eye and the eye falls
over the side of cs  map and hangs there looking at the fag poor tony  and c turned lightblue and bit thru the snakes  head and
died for keeps and shit his pants instanly with shit so bad the hot air blowergrate is blowing small bits of fart and blood and missty
shit up into our maps and poor tony backs offof over c and puts his hands over his madeup map and looks at c thru his fingers 
and yrstruly i take the belt off it goes without saying  and dont  even rethink or dream about tryng maybe a diffrent bag out of a
diffrent bundle from c for how could wo know what bundle wed  cook up outof first so all three bundles must be hot so i dont 
even dream even tho yrstrulys  shiverng and mucis sick allready and now in payback wo has our only   to get straight with for
xmas  it might sound fucking low but the reason we had to leave the decesed body c in one of the librarys  dumsters is the reason
is because the copley squars  finest know it is our personnel hot air blowergrate and if we leave c there its  a sure pinch for us as
known aquain tance and a period of kicking the bird in holding in a cell but the dumster was empty of materil and cs  head made
a fucked up sound when it hit the empty bottom and poor tony cried and wined and said he said he had no inkling that beast wo
was that vindicative and poorold decesed c and how this was it hes  going to get clean from heronout and get a straightjob dancing
in a patty type club in the fenway and everything like that on and on piss and wine  i didnt  say any thing  i had to rethink on the
t to the squar if yrstruly i should elemonade poor tonys  map for keeps for payback on how he purplously lets c shoot up first
and wouldof let yrstruly shoot first even knowing  or make that cheese move and go back down the orangeline to wo and try and
get enough bags to get true straight eating cheese to wo about the wherehouse that poor tony and susan t  cheese and lolasister
with eckwus crashed at now  or like what  yrstruly i almost was cryng  it was when poor tony took off his hiheels and wanted
yrstruly i should boost him like over the edge of cs  bodies  dumster to get back what was left of his feather stoal out of cs  mouth
that yrstruly i thought i decided what to do  but the connected slope wo wasnt  even there in front of the hung toys curtain in the
early xmas am  and then poor tony departed for green pastures and ate cheese  and it took yrstruly two days of kicking the

 bird in the hall out side my mumsters  apartment that for payback she locked the door before i yrstruly can get in a detox to
atleast cop some methedoan and get three squars to stay down in yrstruly to start to thearize on what to try and do after i could
standup straight and walk upright again once more

hal could hear the phone console ringing as he dropped his gear bag and took the room key from around his neck  the phone
itself had been orin s and its plastic case was transparent and you could see the phone s guts 
 mmyellow  
 why do i always get the feeling i m interrupting you in the middle of some like vigorous self abuse session   it was orin s
voice   it s always multiple rings  then you re always a little breathless when you do  
 do what  
 a certain sweaty urgency to your voice  are you one of the     of adolescent males  hallie  
hal never liked talking on the phone after he d gotten high in secret down in the pump room  even if there was water or
liquid handy to keep the cotton at bay  he didn t know why this was so  it just made him uneasy 
 you re sounding hale and fit  o  
 you can tell me  you know  no shame in it  let me tell you  boy  i did myself raw for years on end on that hill  
hal estimated over     of what he told orin on the phone since orin had abruptly started calling again this spring was a lie 
he had no idea why he liked lying to orin on the phone so much  he looked at the clock   where are you  
 home  snug and toasty  it s     out  
 that would be fahrenheit i m assuming  
 this city is made of all glass and light  the windows are like high beams coming at you  the air has that spilled fuel
shimmer to it  
 so to what do we owe  
 sometimes i wear sunglasses even in the house  sometimes at the stadium i hold my hand up and look at it and i swear i can
see right through it  like that thing with the flashlight and your hand  
 hands seem to be sort of a theme to this call  thus far  
 on the way in from the lot off the street here i saw a pedestrian in a pith helmet stagger and like claw at the air and pitch
forward onto his face  another phoenician felled by the heat i think to myself  
it occurred to hal that although he lied about meaningless details to orin on the phone it had never occurred to him to
consider whether orin was ever doing the same thing  this induced a spell of involuted marijuana type thinking that led quickly 
again  to hal s questioning whether or not he was really all that intelligent   sats are six weeks away and pemulis is less and less
helpful on the math  if you want to know what i m doing all day  
 the man s face made a sizzling noise when it hit the pavement  like bacon caliber sizzling  he s still lying there  i see out the
window  he s not moving anymore  everyone s avoiding him  going around him  he looks too hot to touch  a little hispanic kid
made off with his hat  have y all had snow yet  describe snow for me again  hallie  i m begging you  
 so you go around with this image of me sitting around during the day masturbating  is what you re saying  
 i ve actually been thinking of maneuvering for the whole kleenex concession at e t a   as a venture  
 that of course would mean actually contacting c t  and the moms  
 me and this forward looking reserve qb have been making inquiries 
putting out feelers  volume discounts  preferred vendor status  maybe a sideline in unscented lubricants  any thoughts  
 o   
 i m sitting here actually missing new orleans  kid  it d be just coming up on advent i think  the quarter always gets really
quaint and demure during advent  it almost never rains down there during advent for some reason  people remark on it  the
phenomena  
 you sound somehow a little off to me  o  
tm heat crazed  i might be dehydrated  what s that word  everything s looked all beige and powdery all day  trash bags
have been swelling up and spontaneously combusting out in the dumpsters  these sudden rains of coffee grounds and orange
peels  the displacement guys in the barges have to wear asbestos gloves  also i met somebody  hallie  a possibly very special
somebody  
 uh oh  dinnertime  triangle s a clangin  over in west  
 hey haliie though  hang on  kidding aside for a second  what all do you know about separatism

ennet house drug and alcohol recovery house     was founded in the year of the whopper by a nail tough old chronic
drug addict and alcoholic who had spent the bulk of his adult life under the supervision of the massachusetts department of
corrections before discovering the fellowship of alcoholics anonymous at m d c  walpole and undergoing a sudden experience
of total self surrender and spiritual awakening in the shower during his fourth month of continuous aa sobriety  this recovered
addict  alcoholic   who in his new humility so valued aa s tradition of anonymity that he refused even to use his first name  and
was known in boston aa simply as the guy who didn t even use his first name   opened ennet house within a year of his
parole  determined to pass on to other chronic drug addicts and alcoholics what had been so freely given to him in the e tier
shower 
ennet house leases a former physicians  dormitory in the enfield marine public health hospital complex  managed by the
united states veterans administration  ennet house is equipped to provide    male and female clients a nine month period of
closely supervised residency and treatment 
ennet house was not only founded but originally renovated  furnished  and decorated by the nameless local aa ex con  who

   since sobriety doesn t exactly mean instant sainthood   used to lead select teams of early recovery dope fiends on after hours
boosting expeditions at area furniture and housewares establishments 
this legendary anonymous founder was an extremely tough old boston aa galoot who believed passionately that everyone 
no matter how broad the trail of slime they dragged in behind them  deserved the same chance at sobriety through utterly total
surrender he d been granted  it s a kind of extremely tough love found almost exclusively in tough old boston galoots      he
sometimes  the founder  in the house s early days  required incoming residents to attempt to eat rocks   as in like rocks from the
ground   to demonstrate their willingness to go to any lengths for the gift of sobriety  the massachusetts department of public
health s division of substance abuse services eventually requested that this practice be discontinued 
ennet was not any part of the nameless ennet house founder s name  by the way 
the rock thing   which has become a grim bit of mythopoeia now trotted out to illustrate how cushy the present ennet
residents have it   was probably not as whacko as it seemed to division of s a s   since many of the things veteran aa s ask
newcomers to do and believe seem not much less whacko than trying to chew feldspar  e g  be so strung out you can feel your
pulse in your eyeballs  have the shakes so badly you make a spatter painting on the wall every time somebody hands you a cup of
coffee  have the life forms out of the corner of your eye be your only distraction from the chainsaw racing chatter in your head 
sitting there  and have some old lady with cat hair on her nylons come at you to hug you and tell you to make a list of all the
things you re grateful for today  you ll wish you had some feldspar handy  too

dear sir 
i am writing in response to your request for additional information  in block    of the accident reporting form  i put  trying to
do the job alone   as the cause of my accident  you said in your letter that i should explain more fully and i trust that the following
details will be sufficient 
i am a bricklayer by trade  on the day of the accident  march     i was working alone on the roof of a new six story building 
when i completed my work  i discovered that i had about     kg  of brick left over  rather than laboriously carry the bricks down
by hand  i decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley which fortunately was attached to the side of the building at the
sixth floor  securing the rope at ground level  i went up to the roof  swung the barrel out and loaded the brick into it  then i went
back to the ground and untied the rope  holding it tightly to insure a slow descent of the     kg of bricks  you will note in block
    of the accident reporting form that i weigh    kg 
due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly  i lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope 
needless to say  i proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building  in the vicinity of the third floor i met the barrel coming
down  this explains the fractured skull and the broken collar bone 
slowed only slightly  i continued my rapid ascent not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into
the pulleys  fortunately  by this time  i had regained my presence of mind  and was able to hold tightly to the rope in spite of
considerable pain  at approximately the same time  however  the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the
barrel from the force of hitting the ground 
devoid of the weight of the bricks  the barrel now weighed approximately    kg  i refer you again to my weight of    kg in
block      as you could imagine  still holding the rope  i began a rather rapid descent from the pulley down the side of the
building  in the vicinity of the third floor  i met the barrel coming up  this accounts for the two fractured ankles and the laceration
of my legs and lower body 
the encounter with the barrel slowed me enough to lessen my impact with the brick strewn ground below  i am sorry to
report  however  that as i lay there on the bricks in considerable pain  unable to stand or move and watching the empty barrel six
stories above me  i again lost my presence of mind and unfortunately let go of the rope  causing the barrel to begin a

chief steve mcgarrett of  hawaii five    and captain frank furillo of  hill street blues  are useful for seeing how our north
american idea of the hero changed from the b s      s era of  hawaii five    to the b s      s era of  hill street blues  
chief steve mcgarrett is a classically modern hero of action  he acts out  it is what he does  the camera is always on him 
he is hardly ever offscreen  he has just one case per week  the audience knows what the case is and also knows  by the end of
act one  who is guilty  because the audience knows the truth before steve mcgarrett does  there is no mystery  there is only
steve mcgarrett  the drama of  hawaii five    is watching the hero in action  watching steve mcgarrett stalk and strut  homing
in on the truth  homing in is the essence of what the classic hero of modern action does 
steve mcgarrett is not weighed down by administrative state police chief chores  or by females  or friends  or emotions  or
any sorts of conflicting demands on his attention  his field of action is bare of diverting clutter  thus chief steve mcgarrett
single mindedly acts to refashion a truth the audience already knows into an object of law  justice  modern heroism 
in contrast  captain frank furillo is what used to be designated a  post  modern hero  viz   a hero whose virtues are suited to a
more complex and corporate american era  i e   a hero of reaction  captain frank furillo does not investigate cases or singlemindedly home in  he commands a precinct  he is a bureaucrat  and his heroism is bureaucratic  with a genius for navigating
cluttered fields  in each broadcast episode of  hill street blues   captain frank furillo is beset by petty distractions on all sides
from the very beginning of act one  not one but eleven complex cases  each with suspects and snitches and investigating officers
and angry community leaders and victims  families all clamoring for redress  hundreds of tasks to delegate  egos to massage 
promises to make  promises from last week to keep  two or three cops  domestic troubles  payroll vouchers  duty logs  corruption
to be tempted by and agonized over  a police chief who s a political parody  a hyperactive son  an ex wife who haunts the
frosted glass cubicle that serves as frank furillo s office  whereas steve mcgarrett s b s      s office more closely resembled the
libraries of landed gentry  hushed behind two heavy doors and wainscot ted in thick  tropical oak   plus a coldly attractive public
defendress who wants to talk about did this suspect get mirandized in spanish and can frank stop coming too soon he came too
soon again last night maybe he should get into some kind of stress counselling  plus all the weekly moral dilemmas and double
binds his even handed bureaucratic heroism gets captain frank furillo into 
captain frank furillo of  hill street blues  is a  post  modern hero  a virtuoso of triage and compromise and administration 
frank furillo retains his sanity  composure  and superior grooming in the face of a barrage of distracting  unheroic demands that
would have left chief steve mcgarrett slumped  unkempt  and chewing his knuckle in administrative confusion 
in further contrast to chief steve mcgarrett  captain frank furillo is rarely filmed tight or full front  he is usually one part of
a frenetic  moving pan by the program s camera  in contrast   hawaii five o   s camera crew never even used a dolly  favoring a
steady tripodic close up on mcgar rett s face that today seems more reminiscent of romantic portraiture than filmed drama 
what kind of hero comes after mcgarrett s irishized modern cowboy  the lone man of action riding lonely herd in paradise 
furillo s is a whole different kind of loneliness  the  post  modern hero was a heroic part of the herd  responsible for all of what he
is part of  responsible to everyone  his lonely face as placid under pressure as a cow s face  the jut jawed hero of action   hawaii
five     becomes the mild eyed hero of reaction   hill street blues   a decade later  
and  as we have observed thus far in our class  we  as a north american audience  have favored the more stoic  corporate
hero of reactive probity ever since  some might be led to argue  trapped  in the reactive moral ambiguity of  post   and  post post modern culture 
but what comes next  what north american hero can hope to succeed the placid frank  we await  i predict  the hero of  o action  the catatonic hero  the one beyond calm  divorced from all stimulus  carried here and there across sets by burly extras

moment magazine has learned that the tragic fate of the second north american citizen to receive a jarvik ix exterior
artificial heart has  sadly  been kept from the north american people  the woman  a    year old boston accountant with
irreversible restenosis of the heart  responded so well to the replacement of her defective heart with a jarvik ix exterior artificial
heart that within weeks she was able to resume the active lifestyle she had so enjoyed before stricken  pursuing her active
schedule with the extraordinary prosthesis portably installed in a stylish etienne aigner purse  the heart s ventricular tubes ran up
to shunts in the woman s arms and ferried life giving blood back and forth between her living  active body and the extraordinary
heart in her purse 
her tragic  untimely  and  some might say  cruelly ironic fate  however  has been the subject of the all too frequent silence
needless tragedies are buried beneath when they cast the callous misunderstanding of public officials in the negative light of
public knowledge  it took the sort of searching and fearless journalistic doggedness readers have come to respect in moment to
unearth the tragically negative facts of her fate 
the    year old recipient of the jarvik ix exterior artificial heart was actively window shopping in cambridge 
massachusetts  fashionable harvard square when a transvestite purse snatcher  a drug addict with a criminal record all too well
known to public officials  bizarrely outfitted in a strapless cocktail dress  spike heels  tattered feather boa  and auburn wig  brutally

 tore the life sustaining purse from the woman s unwitting grasp 
the active  alert woman gave chase to the purse snatching  woman  for as long as she could  plaintively shouting to passers by
the words  stop her  she stole my heart   on the fashionable sidewalk crowded with shoppers  reportedly shouting repeatedly   she
stole my heart  stop her   in response to her plaintive calls  tragically  misunderstanding shoppers and passers by merely shook
their heads at one another  smiling knowingly at what they ignorantly presumed to be yet another alternative lifestyle s relationship gone sour  a duo of cambridge  massachusetts  patrolmen  whose names are being withheld from moment s dogged
queries  were publicly heard to passively quip   happens all the time   as the victimized woman staggered frantically past in the
wake of the fleet transvestite  shouting for help for her stolen heart 
that the prosthetic crime victim gave spirited chase for over four blocks before collapsing onto her empty chest is testimony
to the impressive capacity of the jarvik ix replacement procedure  was the anonymous comment of a public medical official
reached for comment by moment 
the drug crazed purse snatcher  informed officials passively speculated  may have found even his hardened conscience
moved by the life saving prosthesis the ill gotten woman s aigner purse revealed  which runs on the same rechargeable power cell
as an electric man s razor  and may well have continued to beat and bleed for a period of time in the rudely disconnected purse 
the purse snatcher s response to this conscience appears to have been cruelly striking the jarvik ix exterior artificial heart
repeatedly with a stone or small hammer like tool  where its remains were found some hours later behind the historic boston
public library in fashionable copley square 
is medical science s awe inspiring march forward  however  always doomed to include such tragic incidents of ignorance and
callous loss  one might ask  such seems to be the stance of north american officials  if indeed so  the victims  fate is frequently
kept from the light of public knowledge 
and the facts of the case s outcome  the    year old deceased woman s formerly active  alert brain was removed and
dissected six weeks later by a brigham and women s city of boston hospital medical student reportedly so moved by her terse
toe tag s account of the victim s heartless fate that he confessed to moment a temporary inability to physically wield the power

wry   though in the early days of interlace s
internetted teleputers that operated off largely
the same fiber digital grid as the phone companies  the advent of video telephoning
 a k a   videophony  
enjoyed an interval of huge consumer popularity  
callers thrilled at the idea of phone interfacing
both aurally and facially  the little first generation phone video cameras being too
crude and narrow apertured for anything much more than facial close ups  on firstgeneration teleputers that at that time were little more than high tech
tv sets  though of course they had that little  intelligent agent  homuncular icon that
would
appear at the lower right of a broadcast cable
program and tell you the time and temperature
outside or remind you to take your blood pressure
medication or alert you to a particularly compelling entertainment option now
coming up on
channel like     or something  or of course now alerting you to an incoming video phone
call and then tap dancing with a little iconic straw boater and cane just under a menu of
possible options for
response  and callers did love their little
homuncular icons   but why  within like    months
or   sales quarters  the tumescent demand curve for
 videophony  suddenly collapsed like a kicked tent  so that  by the year of the depend
adult undergarment  fewer than     of all private telephone communications utilized any
video image fiber data transfers or coincident products and services  the average u s 
phone user deciding that s he actually preferred the retrograde old low tech bell era
voice only telephonic interface after all  a preferential about face that cost a good
many precipitant video telephony related entrepreneurs their shirts  plus destabilizing
two highly respected mutual funds that had ground floored heavily in video phone
technology  and

 very nearly wiping out the maryland state employees  retirement system s freddie mac
fund  a fund whose administrator s mistress s brother had been an almost manically
precipitant video phone technology entrepreneur       and but so why the abrupt consumer
retreat back to good old voice only telephoning 
the answer  in a kind of trivalent nutshell  is      emotional stress      physical vanity      a certain queer kind of selfobliterating logic in the microeconomics of consumer high tech 
fl  it turned out that there was something terribly stressful about visual telephone interfaces that hadn t been stressful at all
about voice only interfaces  videophone consumers seemed suddenly to realize that they d been subject to an insidious but wholly
marvelous delusion about conventional voice only telephony  they d never noticed it before  the delusion   it s like it was so
emotionally complex that it could be countenanced only in the context of its loss  good old traditional audio only phone
conversations allowed you to presume that the person on the other end was paying complete attention to you while also permitting
you not to have to pay anything even close to complete attention to her  a traditional aural only conversation   utilizing a handheld phone whose earpiece contained only   little pinholes but whose mouthpiece  rather significantly  it later seemed  contained
     or    little pinholes   let you enter a kind of highway hypnotic semi attentive fugue  while conversing  you could look
around the room  doodle  fine groom  peel tiny bits of dead skin away from your cuticles  compose phone pad haiku  stir things on
the stove  you could even carry on a whole separate additional sign language and exaggerated facial expression type of
conversation with people right there in the room with you  all while seeming to be right there attending closely to the voice on the
phone  and yet   and this was the retrospectively marvelous part   even as you were dividing your attention between the phone
call and all sorts of other idle little fuguelike activities  you were somehow never haunted by the suspicion that the person on the
other end s attention might be similarly divided  during a traditional call  e g   as you let s say performed a close tactile blemishscan of your chin  you were in no way oppressed by the thought that your phonemate was perhaps also devoting a good
percentage of her attention to a close tactile blemish scan  it was an illusion and the illusion was aural and aurally supported  the
phone line s other end s voice was dense  tightly compressed  and vectored right into your ear  enabling you to imagine that the
voice s owner s attention was similarly compressed and focused       even though your own attention was not  was the thing  this
bilateral illusion of unilateral attention was almost infantilely gratifying from an emotional standpoint  you got to believe you
were receiving somebody s complete attention without having to return it  regarded with the objectivity of hindsight  the illusion
appears arational  almost literally fantastic  it would be like being able both to lie and to trust other people at the same time 
video telephony rendered the fantasy insupportable  callers now found they had to compose the same sort of earnest  slightly
overintense listener s expression they had to compose for in person exchanges  those callers who out of unconscious habit
succumbed to fuguelike doodling or pants crease adjustment now came off looking rude  absentminded  or childishly selfabsorbed  callers who even more unconsciously blemish scanned or nostril explored looked up to find horrified expressions on
the video faces at the other end  all of which resulted in videophonic stress 
even worse  of course  was the traumatic expulsion from eden feeling of looking up from tracing your thumb s outline on the
reminder pad or adjusting the old unit s angle of repose in your shorts and actually seeing your videophonic interfacee idly strip a
shoelace of its gumlet as she talked to you  and suddenly realizing your whole infantile fantasy of commanding your partner s
attention while you yourself got to fugue doodle and make little genital adjustments was deluded and insupportable and that you
were actually commanding not one bit more attention than you were paying  here  the whole attention business was monstrously
stressful  video callers found 
    and the videophonic stress was even worse if you were at all vain  i e  if you worried at all about how you looked  as in
to other people  which all kidding aside who doesn t  good old aural telephone calls could be fielded without makeup  toupee 
surgical prostheses  etc  even without clothes  if that sort of thing rattled your saber  but for the image conscious  there was of
course no such answer as you are informality about visual video telephone calls  which consumers began to see were less like
having the good old phone ring than having the doorbell ring and having to throw on clothes and attach prostheses and do hairchecks in the foyer mirror before answering the door 
but the real coffin nail for videophony involved the way callers  faces looked on their tp screen  during calls  not their
callers  faces  but their own  when they saw them on video  it was a three button affair   after all  to use the tp s cartridge card s
video record option to record both pulses in a two way visual call and play the call back and see how your face had actually
looked to the other person during the call  this sort of appearance check was no more resistible than a mirror  but the experience
proved almost universally horrifying  people were horrified at how their own faces appeared on a tp screen  it wasn t just
 anchorman s bloat   that well known impression of extra weight that video inflicts on the face  it was worse  even with high end
tps  high def viewer screens  consumers perceived something essentially blurred and moist looking about their phone faces  a
shiny pallid indefiniteness that struck them as not just unflattering but somehow evasive  furtive  untrustworthy  unlikable  in an
early and ominous interlace g t e  focus group survey that was all but ignored in a storm of entrepreneurial sci fi tech
enthusiasm  almost     of respondents who received visual access to their own faces during videophonic calls specifically used
the terms untrustworthy  unlikable  or hard to like in describing their own visage s appearance  with a phenomenally ominous   
  of senior citizen respondents specifically comparing their video faces to that of richard nixon during the nixon kennedy
debates of b s       
the proposed solution to what the telecommunications industry s psychological consultants termed video physiognomic
dysphoria  or vpd  was  of course  the advent of high definition masking  and in fact it was those entrepreneurs who gravitated
toward the production of high definition videophonic imaging and then outright masks who got in and out of the short lived
videophonic era with their shirts plus solid additional nets 
mask wise  the initial option of high definition photographic imaging   i e  taking the most flattering elements of a variety
of flattering multi angle photos of a given phone consumer and   thanks to existing image configuration equipment already
pioneered by the cosmetics and law enforcement industries   combining them into a wildly attractive high def broadcastable
composite of a face wearing an earnest  slightly overintense expression of complete attention   was quickly supplanted by the
more inexpensive and byte economical option of  using the exact same cosmetic and fbi software  actually casting the enhanced

 facial image in a form fitting polybutylene resin mask  and consumers soon found that the high up front cost of a permanent
wearable mask was more than worth it  considering the stress  and vfd reduction benefits  and the convenient velcro straps for
the back of the mask and caller s head cost peanuts  and for a couple fiscal quarters phone cable companies were able to rally
vpd afflicted consumers  confidence by working out a horizontally integrated deal where free composite and masking services
came with a videophone hookup  the high def masks  when not in use  simply hung on a small hook on the side of a tp s phoneconsole  admittedly looking maybe a bit surreal and discomfiting when detached and hanging there empty and wrinkled  and
sometimes there were potentially awkward mistaken identity snafus involving multi user family or company phones and the
hurried selection and attachment of the wrong mask taken from some long row of empty hanging masks   but all in all the masks
seemed initially like a viable industry response to the vanity  stress  and nixonian facial image problem 
   and maybe also    but combine the natural entrepreneurial instinct to satisfy all sufficiently high consumer demand  on the
one hand  with what appears to be an almost equally natural distortion in the way persons tend to see themselves  and it becomes
possible to account historically for the speed with which the whole high def videophonic mask thing spiralled totally out of
control  not only is it weirdly hard to evaluate what you yourself look like  like whether you re good looking or not   e g  try
looking in the mirror and determining where you stand in the attractiveness hierarchy with anything like the objective ease you
can determine whether just about anyone else you know is good looking or not   but it turned out that consumers  instinctively
skewed self perception  plus vanity related stress  meant that they began preferring and then outright demanding videophone
masks that were really quite a lot better looking than they themselves were in person  high def mask entrepreneurs ready and
willing to supply not just verisimilitude but aesthetic enhancement   stronger chins  smaller eye bags  air brushed scars and
wrinkles   soon pushed the original mimetic mask entrepreneurs right out of the market  in a gradually unsubtlizing progression 
within a couple more sales quarters most consumers were now using masks so undeniably better looking on videophones than
their real faces were in person  transmitting to one another such horrendously skewed and enhanced masked images of themselves 
that enormous psychosocial stress began to result  large numbers of phone users suddenly reluctant to leave home and interface
personally with people who  they feared  were now habituated to seeing their far better looking masked selves on the phone and
would on seeing them in person suffer  so went the callers  phobia  the same illusion shattering aesthetic disappointment that  e g  
certain women who always wear makeup give people the first time they ever see them without makeup 
the social anxieties surrounding the phenomenon psych consultants termed optimistically misrepresentational masking  or
omm  intensified steadily as the tiny crude first generation videophone cameras  technology improved to where the aperture
wasn t as narrow  and now the higher end tiny cameras could countenance and transmit more or less full body images  certain
psychologically unscrupulous entrepreneurs began marketing full body polybutylene and  urethane   d cutouts   sort of like the
headless muscleman and bathing beauty cutouts you could stand behind and position your chin on the cardboard neck stump of
for cheap photos at the beach  only these full body videophone masks were vastly more high tech and convincing looking  once
you added variable   d wardrobe  hair  and eye color options  various aesthetic enlargements and reductions  etc   costs started to
press the envelope of mass market affordability  even though there was at the same time horrific social pressure to be able to
afford the very best possible masked   d body image  to keep from feeling comparatively hideous looking on the phone  how
long  then  could one expect it to have been before the relentless entrepreneurial drive toward an ever better mousetrap conceived
of the transmittable tableau  a k a  tt   which in retrospect was probably the really sharp business end of the videophonic
coffin nail  with tts  facial and bodily masking could now be dispensed with altogether and replaced with the video transmitted
image of what was essentially a heavily doctored still photograph  one of an incredibly fit and attractive and well turned out
human being  someone who actually resembled you the caller only in such limited respects as like race and limb number  the
photo s face focused attentively in the direction of the video phonic camera from amid the sumptuous but not ostentatious
appointments of the sort of room that best reflected the image of yourself you wanted to transmit  etc 
the tableaux were simply high quality transmission ready photographs  scaled down to diorama like proportions and fitted
with a plastic holder over the videophone camera  not unlike a lens cap  extremely good looking but not terrifically successful
entertainment celebrities   the same sort who in decades past would have swelled the cast lists of infomercials   found
themselves in demand as models for various high end videophone tableaux 
because they involved simple transmission ready photography instead of computer imaging and enhancement  the tableaux
could be mass produced and commensurately priced  and for a brief time they helped ease the tension between the high cost of
enhanced body masking and the monstrous aesthetic pressures videophony exerted on callers  not to mention also providing
employment for set designers  photographers  airbrushers  and infomercial level celebrities hard pressed by the declining fortunes
of broadcast television advertising 
    but there s some sort of revealing lesson here in the beyond short term viability curve of advances in consumer
technology  the career of videophony conforms neatly to this curve s classically annular shape  first there s some sort of terrific 
sci fi like advance in consumer tech   like from aural to video phoning   which advance always  however  has certain unforeseen disadvantages for the consumer  and then but the market niches created by those disadvantages   like people s
stressfully vain repulsion at their own videophonic appearance   are ingeniously filled via sheer entrepreneurial verve  and yet
the very advantages of these ingenious disadvantage compensations seem all too often to undercut the original high tech advance 
resulting in consumer recidivism and curve closure and massive shirt loss for precipitant investors  in the present case  the stressand vanity compensations  own evolution saw video callers rejecting first their own faces and then even their own heavily masked
and enhanced physical likenesses and finally covering the video cameras altogether and transmitting attractively stylized static
tableaux to one another s tps  and  behind these lens cap dioramas and transmitted tableaux  callers of course found that they
were once again stresslessly invisible  unvainly makeup  and toupeeless and baggy eyed behind their celebrity dioramas  once
again free   since once again unseen   to doodle  blemish scan  manicure  crease check   while on their screen  the attractive 
intensely attentive face of the well appointed celebrity on the other end s tableau reassured them that they were the objects of a
concentrated attention they themselves didn t have to exert 
and of course but these advantages were nothing other than the once lost and now appreciated advantages of good old bellera blind aural only telephoning  with its   and      pinholes  the only difference was that now these expensive silly unreal

 stylized tableaux were being transmitted between tps on high priced video fiber lines  how much time  after this realization sank
in and spread among consumers  mostly via phone  interestingly   would any micro econometrist expect to need to pass before
high tech visual videophony was mostly abandoned  then  a return to good old telephoning not only dictated by common
consumer sense but actually after a while culturally approved as a kind of chic integrity  not ludditism but a kind of retrograde
transcendence of sci fi ish high tech for its own sake  a transcendence of the vanity and the slavery to high tech fashion that
people view as so unattractive in one another  in other words a return to aural only telephony became  at the closed curve s end  a
kind of status symbol of anti vanity  such that only callers utterly lacking in self awareness continued to use videophony and
tableaux  to say nothing of masks  and these tacky facsimile using people became ironic cultural symbols of tacky vain slavery to
corporate pr and high tech novelty  became the subsidized era s tacky equivalents of people with leisure suits  black velvet
paintings  sweater vests for their poodles  electric zirconium jewelry  nocoat lin guascrapers  and c  most communications
consumers put their tableaux dioramas at the back of a knick knack shelf and covered their cameras with standard black lenscaps and now used their phone consoles  little mask hooks to hang these new little plasticene address and phone diaries specially
made with a little receptacle at the top of the binding for convenient hanging from former mask hooks  even then  of course  the
bulk of u s  consumers remained verifiably reluctant to leave home and teleputer and to interface personally  though this
phenomenon s endurance can t be attributed to the videophony fad per se  and anyway the new panagoraphobia served to open
huge new entrepreneurial teleputerized markets for home shopping and  delivery  and didn t cause much industry concern

a rousing game of who can find  boil  and box the most empty visine bottles in a three hour period without any kindof authority figure knowing what you re up to  a game which mario had found thumpingly weird when pemulis introduced
him to it three years ago  but which mario s really come to look forward to  since he s found he has a real sort of mystical intuitive
knack for finding visine bottles in the sedimentary layers of packed dumpsters  and always seems to win hands down  and if

plays for pepperdine  and paid to have reconditioned and the rusty chain and hook that hung from the tow truck s back tilted

congregated line and social interactions and vending operation of the urine day lobby  using his strap attached head mounted
camera and thoracic police lock and foot treadle  apparently getting footage for one of the short strange himself influenced
conceptual cartridges the administration lets him occupy his time making and futzing around with down in the late founder s
editing and f x facilities off the main sub comm  ad  tunnel  and pemulis and axford do not object to the filming  nor do they
even do that hand to temple face obscuring thing when he aims the head mounted bolex their way  since they know nobody will
end up seeing the footage except mario himself  and that at their request he ll modulate and scramble the vendors  and customers 
faces into undulating systems of flesh colored squares  by means of his late father s reconfigururing matte panel in the editing
room  since facial scrambling will heighten whatever weird conceptual effect mario s usually after anyway  though also because
mario s notoriously fond of undulating flesh colored squares and will jump at any opportunity to edit them in over people s faces

traffic  an inner city development program tennis prodigy at ten  recruited up the hill at eleven  with parents who wanted to
know how much e t a  d pay up front for rights to all future possible income  cavalier about practice but a bundle of strangled
nerves in tournaments  the rap on pemulis is that he s way lower ranked than he could be with a little hard work  since he s not
only e t a  s finest eschatonic     marksman off the lob but schtitt says is the one youth here now who knows truly what is it to
punch the volley  pemulis  whose pre e t a  home life was apparently hackle raising  also sells small time drugs of distinguished
potency at reasonable retail prices to a large pie slice of the total junior tournament circuit market  mario incandenza is one of
those people who wouldn t see the point of trying recreational chemicals even if he knew how to go about it  he just wouldn t get
it  his smile  below the bolex camera strapped to his large but sort of withered looking head  is constant and broad as he films the
line s serpentine movement against glass shelves full of prizes 
m  m  pemulis  whose middle name is mathew  sic   has the highest stanford binet of any kid on academic probation ever at
the academy  hal incandenza s most valiant efforts barely get pemulis through mrs  i s triad of required grammars     and
soma r  l  o  chawaf s heady literature of discipline  because pemulis  who claims he sees every third word upside down 
actually just has a born tech science wienie s congenital impatience with the referential murkiness and inelegance of verbal
systems  his early tennis promise quick peaking and it s turned out a bit dilettantish  pemulis s real enduring gift is for math and
hard science  and his scholarship is the coveted james o  incandenza geometrical optics scholarship  of which there is only one 
and which each term pemulis manages to avoid losing by just one dento dermal layer of overall g p a   and which gives him
sanctioned access to all the late director s lenses and equipment  some of which turn out to be useful to unrelated enterprises 
mario s the only other person sharing the optic and editing labs off the main tunnel  and the two have the kind of transpersonal
bond that shared interests and mutual advantage can inspire  if mario s not helping pemulis fabricate the products of independentoptical study work m p  isn t really much into doing   you should see the boy with a convex lens  avril likes to say within
mario s hearing  he s like a fish in brine   then pemulis is giving mario  who s a film nut but no great tech mind  serious help
with cinemo optical praxis  the physics of focal length and reflective compounds   you should see pemulis with an emulsion
curve  yawning blasely under his bill reversed yachting hat and scratching an armpit  juggling differentials like a boy born to wear
a pocket protector and high water corduroys and electrician s tape on his hornrims  temples  asking mario if he knows what you
call three canadians copulating on a snowmobile  mario and his brother hal both consider pemulis a good friend  though
friendship at e t a  is nonnego tiable currency 
hal incandenza for a long time identified himself as a lexical prodigy who   though avril had taken pains to let all three of
her children know that her nonjudgmental love and pride depended in no way on achievement or performance or potential talent
  had made his mother proud  plus a really good tennis player  hal incandenza is now being encouraged to identify himself as a
late blooming prodigy and possible genius at tennis who is on the verge of making every authority figure in his world and beyond
very proud indeed  he s never looked better on court or on monthly o n a n t a  paper  he is erumpent  he has made what
schtitt termed a  leap of exponents  at a post pubescent age when radical  plateaux hopping  near j  wayne and show caliber
improvement is extraordinarily rare in tennis  he gets his sterile urine gratis  though he could well afford to pay  pemulis depends
on him for verbal academic support  and dislikes owing favors  even to friends 
hal is  at seventeen  as of    y d a u   judged ex cathedra the fourth best tennis player under age eighteen in the united
states of america  and the sixth best on the continent  by those athletic organizing bodies duly charged with the task of ranking 
hal s head  closely monitored by delint and staff  is judged still level and focused and unswollen  bludgeoned by the sudden eclat
and rise in general expectations  when asked how he s doing with it all  hal says fine and thanks you for asking 
if hal fulfills this newly emergent level of promise and makes it all the way up to the show  mario will be the only one of the
incandenza children not wildly successful as a professional athlete  no one who knows mario could imagine that this fact would
ever even occur to him 

 orin  mario  and hal s late father was revered as a genius in his original profession without anybody ever realizing what he
really turned out to be a genius at  even he himself  at least not while he was alive  which is perhaps bona fidely tragic but also  as
far as mario s concerned  ultimately all right  if that s the way things unfolded 
certain people find people like mario incandenza irritating or even think they re outright bats  dead inside in some essential
way 
michael pemulis s basic posture with people is that mrs  pemulis raised no dewy eyed fools  he wears painter s caps on court
and sometimes a yachting cap turned around       and  since he s not ranked high enough to get any free corporate clothing
offers  plays in t shirts with things like allston hs wolf spiders and choosy mothers and the fiends in
human shape y d a u  tour or like an ancient can you believe it the supreme court just desecrated
our flag on them  his face is the sort of spiky featured brow dominated feen ian face you see all over irish allston and
brighton  its chin and nose sharp and skin the natal brown color of the shell of a quality nut 
michael pemulis is nobody s fool  and he fears the dealer s brutus  the potential eater of cheese  the rat  the wiretap  the
pubescent looking finest sent to make him look foolish  so when somebody calls his room s phone  even on video  and wants to
buy some sort of substance  they have to right off the bat utter the words  please commit a crime   and michael pemulis will reply
 gracious me and mine  a crime you say   and the customer has to insist  right over the phone  and say he ll pay michael pemulis
money to commit a crime  or like that he ll harm michael pemulis in some way if he refuses to commit a crime  and michael
pemulis will in a clear and i d able voice make an appointment to see the caller in person to  plead for my honor and personal
safety   so that if anybody eats cheese later or the phone s frequency is covertly accessed  somehow  pemulis will have been
entrapped

loved as he roared by  jim  she never intuited the gentle and cunning economy behind this man s quote harsh sloppy unstudied

where we keep this      mercury montclair you know so well  this montclair weighs       pounds  give or take  it has eight
cylinders and a canted windshield and aerodynamic fins  jim  and has a maximum flat out road speed of    m p h  per  i described
the shade of the paint job of this montclair to the dealer when i first saw it as bit lip red  jim  it s a machine  it will do what it s
made for and do it perfectly  but only when stimulated by someone who s made it his business to know its tricks and seams  as a
body  the stimulator of this car must know the car  jim  feel it  be inside much more than just the       the compartment  it s an
object  jim  a body  but don t let it fool you  sitting here  mute  it will respond  if given its due  with artful care  it s a body and
will respond with a well oiled purr once i get some decent oil in her and all mercuryish at up to    big ones per for just that driver
who treats its body like his own  who feels the big steel body he s inside  who quietly and unnoticed feels the nubbly plastic of the
grip of the shift up next to the wheel when he shifts just as he feels the skin and flesh  the muscle and sinew and bone wrapped in
gray spiderwebs of nerves in the blood fed hand just as he feels the plastic and metal and flange and teeth  the pistons and rubber
and rods of the amber fueled montclair  when he shifts  the bodily red of a well bit lip  parping along at a silky    plus per  jim 
a toast to our knowledge of bodies  to high level tennis on the road of life  ah  oh 
son  you re ten  and this is hard news for somebody ten  even if you re almost five eleven  a possible pituitary freak  son 
you re a body  son  that quick little scientific prodigy s mind she s so proud of and won t quit twittering about  son  it s just neural
spasms  those thoughts in your mind are just the sound of your head revving  and head is still just body  jim  commit this to
memory  head is body  jim  brace yourself against my shoulders here for this hard news  at ten  you re a machine a body an
object  jim  no less than this rutilant montclair  this coil of hose here or that rake there for the front yard s gravel or sweet jesus
this nasty fat spider flexing in its web over there up next to the rake handle  see it  see it  latrodectus mactans  jim  widow 
grab this racquet and move gracefully and feelingly over there and kill that widow for me  young sir jim  go on  make it say  k  
take no names  there s a lad  here s to a spiderless section of communal garage  ah 
bodies bodies everywhere  a tennis ball is the ultimate body  kid  we re coming to the crux of what i have to try to impart to
you before we get out there and start actuating this fearsome potential of yours  jim  a tennis ball is the ultimate body  perfectly
round  even distribution of mass  but empty inside  utterly  a vacuum  susceptible to whim  spin  to force   used well or poorly 
it will reflect your own character  characterless itself  pure potential  have a look at a ball  get a ball from the cheap green plastic
laundry basket of old used balls i keep there by the propane torches and use to practice the occasional serve  jimbo  attaboy  now
look at the ball  heft it  feel the weight  here  i ll    tear the ball      open  whew  see  nothing in there but evacuated air that
smells like a kind of rubber hell  empty  pure potential  notice i tore it open along the seam  it s a body  you ll learn to treat it
with consideration  son  some might say a kind of love  and it will open for you  do your bidding  be at your beck and soft lover s
call  the thing truly great players with hale bodies who overshadow all others have is a way with the ball that s called  and keep in
mind the garage door and broiler  touch  touch the ball  now that s     that s the touch of a player right there  and as with the ball
so with that big thin slumped overtall body  sir jimbo  i m predicting it right now  i see the way you ll apply the lessons of today to
yourself as a physical body  no more carrying your head at the level of your chest under round slumped shoulders  no more
tripping up  no more overshot reaches  shattered plates  tilted lampshades  slumped shoulders and caved in chest  the simplest
objects twisting and resistant in your big thin hands  boy  imagine what it feels like to be this ball  jim  total physicality  no
revving head  complete presence  absolute potential  sitting there potentially absolute in your big pale slender girlish hand so
young its thumb s unwrinkled at the joint  my thumb s wrinkled at the joint  jim  some might say gnarled  have a look at this
thumb right here  but i still treat it as my own  i give it its due  you want a drink of this  son  i think you re ready for a drink of
this  no  nein  today  lesson one out there  you become  for better or worse  jim  a man  a player  a body in commerce with
bodies  a helmsman at your own vessel s tiller  a machine in the ghost  to quote a phrase  ah  a ten year old freakishly tall bowtied and thick spectacled citizen of the      i drink this  sometimes  when i m not actively working  to help me accept the same
painful things it s now time for me to tell you  son  jim  are you ready  i m telling you this now because you have to know what
i m about to tell you if you re going to be the more than near great top level tennis player i know you re going to be eventually
very soon  brace yourself  son  get ready  it s glo       gloriously painful  have just maybe a taste  here  this flask is silver  treat it
with due care  feel its shape  the near soft feel of the warm silver and the calfskin sheath that covers only half its flat rounded
silver length  an object that rewards a considered touch  feel the slippery heat  that s the oil from my fingers  my oil  jim  from
my body  not my hand  son  feel the flask  heft it  get to know it  it s an object  a vessel  it s a two pint flask full of amber liquid 
actually more like half full  it seems  so it seems  this flask has been treated with due care  it s never been dropped or jostled or
crammed  it s never had an errant drop  not drop one  spilled out of it  i treat it as if it can feel  i give it its due  as a body  unscrew
the cap  hold the calfskin sheath in your right hand and use your good left hand to feel the cap s shape and ease it around on the
threads  son       son  you ll have to put that what is that that columbia guide to refractive indices second edition down  son 
looks heavy anyway  a tendon strainer  fuck up your pronator teres and surrounding tendons before you even start  you re going

 to have to put down the book  for once  young sir jimbo  you never try to handle two objects at the same time without just aeons
of diligent practice and care  a brando like dis       and well no you don t just drop the book  son  you don t just just don t drop the
big old guide to indices on the dusty garage floor so it raises a square bloom of dust and gets our nice white athletic socks all gray
before we even hit the court  boy  jesus i just took five minutes explaining how the key to being even a potential player is to treat
the things with just exactly the     here lemme have this      that books aren t just dropped with a crash like bottles in the trashcan
they re placed  guided  with senses on full  feeling the edges  the pressure on the little floor of both hands  fingers as you bend at
the knees with the book  the slight gassy shove as the air on the dusty floor     as the floor s air gets displaced in a soft square that
raises no dust  like soooo  not like so  got me  got it  well now don t be that way  son  don t be that way  now  don t get all
oversensitive on me  son  when all i m trying to do is help you  son  jim  i hate this when you do this  your chin just disappears
into that bow tie when your big old overhung lower lip quivers like that  you look chinless  son  and big lipped  and that cape of
mucus that s coming down on your upper lip  the way it shines  don t  just don t  it s revolting  son  you don t want to revolt people 
you have to learn to control this sort of oversensitivity to hard truths  this sort of thing  take and exert some goddamn control is the
whole point of what i m taking this whole entire morning off rehearsal with not one but two vitally urgent auditions looming down
my neck so i can show you  planning to let you move the seat back and touch the shift and maybe even     maybe even drive the
montclair  god knows your feet ll reach  right jimbo  jim  hey  why not drive the montclair  why not you drive us over  starting
today  pull up by the courts where today you ll   here  look  see how i unscrew it  the cap  with the soft very outermost tips of
my gnarled fingers which i wish they were steadier but i m exerting control to control my anger at that chin and lip and the cape of
snot and the way your eyes slant and goggle like some sort of mon goloid child s when you re threatening to cry but just the very
tips of the fingers  here  the most sensitive parts  the parts bathed in warm oil  the whorled pads  i feel them singing with nerves
and blood i let them extend     further than the warm silver hip flask s cap s very top down its broadening cone where to where the
threads around the upraised little circular mouth lie hidden while with the other warm singing hand i gently grip the leather holster
so i can feel the way the whole flask feels as i guide     guide the cap around on its silver threads  hear that  stop that and listen 
hear that  the sound of threads moving through well machined grooves  with great care  a smooth barbershop spiral  my whole
hand right through the pads of my fingertips less     less unscrewing  here  than guiding  persuading  reminding the silver cap s
body what it s built to do  machined to do  the silver cap knows  jim  i know  you know  we ve been through this before  leave the
book alone  boy  it s not going anywhere  so the silver cap leaves the flask s mouth s warm grooved lips with just a snick  hear
that  that faintest snick  not a rasp or a grinding sound or harsh  not a harsh brutal brando esque rasp of attempted domination but
a snick a     nuance  there  ah  oh  like the once you ve heard it never mistakable ponk of a true hit ball  jim  well pick it up then if
you re afraid of a little dust  jim  pick the book up if it s going to make you all goggle eyed and chinless honestly jesus why do i
try i try and try just wanted to introduce you to the broiler s garage and let you drive  maybe  feeling the montclair s body  taking
my time to let you pull up to the courts with the montclair s shift in a neutral glide and the eight cylinders thrumming and snicking
like a healthy heart and the wheels all perfectly flush with the curb and bring out my good old trusty laundry      laundry basket of
balls and racquets and towels and flask and my son  my flesh of my flesh  white slumped flesh of my flesh who wanted to embark
on what i predict right now will be a tennis career that ll put his busted up used up old dad back square in his little place  who
wanted to maybe for once be a real boy and learn how to play and have fun and frolic and play around in the unrelieved sunshine
this city s so fuck all famous for  to enjoy it while he can because did your mother tell you we re moving  that we re moving back
to california finally this spring  we re moving  son  i m harking one last attempted time to that celluloid siren s call  i m giving it
the one last total shot a man s obligation to his last waning talent deserves  jim  we re headed for the big time again at last for the
first time since she announced she was having you  jim  hitting the road  celluloid bound  so say adios to that school and that
fluttery little moth of a physics teacher and those slumped chinless slide rule wielding friends of no now wait i didn t mean it i
meant i wanted to tell you now  ahead of time  your mother and i  to give you plenty of notice so you could adjust this time
because oh you made it so unmisinterpretably clear how this last move to this trailer park upset you so  didn t you  to a mobile
home with chemical toilet and bolts to hold it in place and widow webs everyplace you look and grit settling on everything like
dust out here instead of the club s staff quarters i got us removed from or the house it was clearly my fault we couldn t afford anymore  it was my fault  i mean who else s fault would it be  am i right  that we moved your big soft body with allegedly not
enough notice and that east side school you cried over and that negro research resource librarian there with the hair out to here
that      that lady with the upturned nose on tiptoe all the time i have to tell you she seemed so consummate east side tucsonian all
self consciously not of this earth s grit urging us to quote nurture your optical knack with physics with her nose upturned so you
could see up in there and on her toes like something skilled overhead had sunk a hook between her big splayed fingerling s nostrils
and were reeling skyward up toward the aether little by little i ll bet those heelless pumps are off the floor altogether by now son
what do you say son what do you think       no  go on  cry  don t inhibit yourself  i won t say a word  except it s getting to me less
all the time when you do it  i ll just warn you  i think you re overworking the tears and the       it s getting less effec      effective
with me each time you use it though we know we both know don t we just between you and me we know it ll always work on your
mother  won t it  never fail  she ll every time take and bend your big head down to her shoulder so it looks obscene  if you could
see it  pat patting on your back like she s burping some sort of slumping oversized obscene bow tied infant with a book straining
his pronator teres  crying  will you do this when you re grown  will there be episodes like this when you re a man at your own
tiller  a citizen of a world that won t go pat pat there there  will your face crumple and bulge like this when you re six and a half
grotesque feet tall  six six plus like your grandfather may he rot in hell s rubber vacuum when he finally kicks on the tenth tee and
with your flat face and no chin just like him on that poor dumb patient woman s fragile wet snotty long suffering shoulder did i
tell you what he did  did i tell you what he did  i was your age jim here take the flask no give it here  oh  oh  i was thirteen  and
i d started to play well  seriously  i was twelve or thirteen and playing for years already and he d never been to watch  he d never
come once to where i was playing  to watch  or even changed his big flat expression even once when i brought home a trophy i
won trophies or a notice in the paper tucson native qualifies for national jr ch ships he never acknowledged i
even existed as i was  not as i do you  jim  not as i take care to bend over backwards way  way out of my way to let you know i
see you recognize you am aware of you as a body care about what might go on behind that big flat face bent over a homemade
prism  he plays golf  your grandfather  your grand pappy  golf  a golf man  is my tone communicating the contempt  billiards

 on a big table  jim  a bodiless game of spasmodic flailing and flying sod  a quote unquote sport  anal rage and checkered berets 
this is almost empty  this is just about it  son  what say we rain check this  what say i put the last of this out of its amber misery
and we go in and tell her you re not feeling up to snuff enough again and we re rain checking your first introduction to the game
till this weekend and we ll head over this weekend and do two straight days both days and give you a really extensive intensive
intro to a by all appearances limitless future  intensive gentleness and bodily care equals great tennis  jim  we ll go both days and
let you plunge right in and get wet all over  it s only five dollars  the court fee  for one lousy hour  each day  five dollars each
day  don t give it a thought  ten total dollars for an intensive weekend when we live in a glorified trailer and have to share a
garage with two desotos and what looks like a model a on blocks and my montclair can t afford the kind of oil she deserves 
don t look like that  what s money or my rehearsals for the celluloid auditions we re moving     miles for  auditions that may
well comprise your old man s last shot at a life with any meaning at all  compared to my son  right  am i right  come here  kid 
c mere c mere c mere c mere  that s a boy  that s my j o i  of a guy of a joy of boy  that s my kid  in his body  he never came
once  jim  not once  to watch  mother never missed a competitive match  of course  mother came to so many it ceased to mean
anything that she came  she became part of the environment  mothers are like that  as i m sure you re aware all too well  am i
right  right  never came once  kiddo  never lumbered over all slumped and soft and cast his big grotesque long even at midday
shadow at any court i performed on  till one day he came  once  suddenly  once  without precedent or warning  he     came  ah 
oh  i heard him coming long before he hove into view  he cast a long shadow  jim  it was some minor local event  it was some
early round local thing of very little consequence in the larger scheme  i was playing some local dandy  the kind with fine
equipment and creased white clothing and country club lessons that still can t truly play  even  regardless of all the support  you ll
find you often have to endure this type of opponent in the first couple rounds  this gleaming hapless lox of a kid was some client
of my father s son      son of one of his clients  so he came for the client  to put on some sham show of fatherly concern  he wore a
hat and coat and tie at     plus  the client  can t recall the name  there was something canine about his face  i remember  that his
kid across the net had inherited  my father wasn t even sweating  i grew up with the man in this town and never once saw him
sweat  jim  i remember he wore a boater and the sort of gregariously plaid uniform professional men had to wear on the weekends
then  they sat in the indecisive shade of a scraggly palm  the sort of palm that s just crawling with black widows  in the fronds 
that come down without warning  that hide lying in wait in the heat of midday  they sat on the blanket my mother always brought
  my mother  who s dead  and the client  my father stood apart  sometimes in the waving shade  sometimes not  smoking a long
filter  long filters had come into fashion  he never sat on the ground  not in the american southwest he didn t  there was a man
with a healthy respect for spiders  and never on the ground under a palm  he knew he was too grotesquely tall and ungainly to
stand up in a hurry or roll screaming out of the way in a hurry in case of falling spiders  they ve been known to be willing to drop
right out of the trees they hide in  in the daytime  you know  drop right on you if you re sitting on the ground in the shade  he was
no fool  the bastard  a golfer  they all watched  i was right there on the first court  this park no longer exists  jim  cars are now
parked on what used to be these rough green asphalt courts  shimmering in the heat  they were right there  watching  their heads
going back and forth in that windshield wiper way of people watching quality tennis  and was i nervous  young sir j o i   with
the one and only himself there in all his wooden glory there  watching  half in and out of the light  expressionless  i was not  i
was in my body  my body and i were one  my wood wilson from my stack of wood wilsons in their trapezoid presses was a
sentient expression of my arm  and i felt it singing  and my hand  and they were alive  my well armed hand was the secretary of
my mind  lithe and responsive and senza errori  because i knew myself as a body and was fully inside my little child s body out
there  jim  i was in my big right arm and scarless legs  safely ensconced  running here and there  my head pounding like a heart 
sweat purled on every limb  running like a veldt creature  leaping  frolicking  striking with maximum economy and minimum
effort  my eyes on the ball and the corners both  i was two  three  a couple shots ahead of both me and the hapless canine client s
kid  handing the dandy his pampered ass  it was carnage  it was a scene out of nature in its rawest state  jim  you should have
been there  the kid kept bending over to get his breath  the smoothly economical frolicking i was doing contrasted starkly
compared to the heavily jerky way he was being forced to stomp around and lunge  his white knit shirt and name brand shorts
were soaked through so you could see the straps of his jock biting into the soft ass i was handing him  he wore a flitty little white
visor such as fifty two year old women at country clubs and posh southwestern resorts wear  i was  in a word  deft  considered 
prescient  i made him stomp and stagger and lunge  i wanted to humiliate him  the client s long sharp face was sagging  my father
had no face  it was sharply shadowed and then illuminated in the wagging fronds  shadow he half stood in but was wreathed in
smoke from the long filters he fancied  long plastic filtered holders  yellowed at the stem  in imitation of the president  as courtiers
once spluttered with the king       veiled in shade and then lit smoke  the client didn t know enough to keep quiet  he thought he
was at a ball game or something  the client s voice carried  our first court was right near the tree they sat under  the client s legs
were out in front of them and protruded from the sharp star of frond shade  his slacks were lattice shadowed from the pattern of
the fence his son and i played just behind  he was drinking the lemonade my mother had brought for me  she made it fresh  he
said i was good  my father s client did  in that emphasized way that made his voice carry  you know  son  good godfrey
incandenza old trout but that lad of yours is good  unquote  i heard him say it as i ran and whacked and frolicked  and i heard the
tall son of a bitch s reply  after a long pause during which the world s whole air hung there as if lifted and left to swing  standing
at the baseline  or walking back to the baseline  to either serve or receive  one of the two  i heard the client  his voice carried  and
then later i heard my father s reply  may he rot in a green and empty hell  i heard what     what he said in reply  sonbo  but not
until after i d fallen  i insist on this point  jim  not until after i d started to fall  jim  i d been in the middle of trying to run down a
ball way out of mortal reach  a rare blind lucky dribbler of a drop shot from the over groomed lox across the net  a point i could
have more than afforded to concede  but that s not the way i     that s not the way a real player plays  with respect and due effort
and care for every point  you want to be great  near great  you give every ball everything  and then some  you concede nothing 
even against loxes  you play right up to your limit and then pass your limit and look back at your former limit and wave a hankie
at it  embarking  you enter a trance  you feel the seams and edges of everything  the court becomes a     an extremely unique
place to be  it will do everything for you  it will let nothing escape your body  objects move as they re made to  at the lightest
easiest touch  you slip into the clear current of back and forth  making delicate x s and l s across the harsh rough bright green
asphalt surface  your sweat the same temperature as your skin  playing with such ease and total mindless effortless effort and and

 and entranced concentration you don t even stop to consider whether to run down every ball  you re barely aware you re doing it 
your body s doing it for you and the court and game s doing it for your body  you re barely involved  it s magic  boy  nothing
touches it  when it s right  i predict it  facts and figures and curved glass and those elbow straining books of yours  lightless pages
are going to seem flat by comparison  static  dead and white and flat  they don t begin to      it s like a dance  jim  the point is i
was too bodily respectful to slip up and fall on my own  out there  and the other point is i started to fall forward even before i
started to hear him reply  standing there  yes  but he ll never be great  what he said in no way made me fall forward  the
unlovely opponent had dribbled one just barely over the too low public park net  a freak accident  a mishit drop shot  and another
man on another court in another early round laugher would have let it dribble  conceded the affordable  not tried to wave a hankie
from the vessel of his limit  not race on all eight healthy scarless cylinders desperately forward toward the net to try to catch the
goddamn thing on the first bounce  jim  but any man can slip  i don t know what i slipped on  son  there were spiders well known
to infest the palms  fronds all along the courts  fences  they come down at night on threads  bulbous  flexing  i m thinking it could
have been a bulbous goo filled widow i stepped and slipped on  jim  a spider  a mad rogue spider come down on its thread into
the shade  flabby and crawling  or that leapt suicidally right from an overhanging frond onto the court  probably making a slight
flabby hideous sound when it landed  crawling around on its claws  blinking grotesquely in the hot light it hated  that i stepped on
rushing forward and killed and slipped on the mess the big loathsome spider made  see these scars  all knotted and ragged  like
something had torn at my own body s knees the way a slouching brando would just rip a letter open with his teeth and let the
envelope fall on the floor all wet and rent and torn  all the palms along the fence were sick  they had palm rot  it was the a d 
year       of the great bisbee palm rot epidemic  all through the state  and they were losing their fronds and the fronds were
blighted and the color of really old olives in those old slim jars at the very back of the refrigerator and exuded a sick sort of puslike slippery discharge and sometimes abruptly fell from trees curving back and forth through the air like celluloid pirates  paper
swords  god i hate fronds  jim  i m thinking it could have been either a daytime latrodectus or some pus from a frond  the wind
blew cruddy pus from the webbed fronds onto the court  maybe  up near the net  either way  something poisonous or infected  at
any rate  unexpected and slick  all it takes is a second  you re thinking  jim  the body betrays you and down you go  on your
knees  sliding on sandpaper court  not so  son  i used to have another flask like this  smaller  a rather more cunning silver flask  in
the glove compartment of my montclair  your devoted mother did something to it  the subject has never been mentioned between
us  not so  it was a foreign body  or a substance  not my body  and if anybody did any betraying that day i m telling you sonny kid
boy it was something   did  jimmer  i may well have betrayed that fine young lithe tan unslumped body  i may very well have
gotten rigid  overconscious  careless of it  listening for what my father  who i respected  i respected that man  jim  is what s sick  i
knew he was there  i was conscious of his flat face and filter s long shadow  i knew him  jim  things were different when i was
growing up  jim  i hate     jesus i hate saying something like this  this things were different when i was a lad type cliche shit  the
sort of cliche fathers back then spouted  assuming he said anything at all  but it was  different  our kids  my generation s kids 
they     now you  this post brando crowd  you new kids can t like us or dislike us or respect us or not as human beings  jim  your
parents  no  wait  you don t have to pretend you disagree  don t  you don t have to say it  jim  because i know it  i could have
predicted it  watching brando and dean and the rest  and i know it  so don t splutter  i blame no one your age  boyo  you see
parents as kind or unkind or happy or miserable or drunk or sober or great or near great or failed the way you see a table square or
a montclair lip red  kids today       you kids today somehow don t know how to feel  much less love  to say nothing of respect 
we re just bodies to you  we re just bodies and shoulders and scarred knees and big bellies and empty wallets and flasks to you 
i m not saying something cliche like you take us for granted so much as i m saying you cannot     imagine our absence  we re so
present it s ceased to mean  we re environmental  furniture of the world  jim  i could imagine that man s absence  jim  i m telling
you you cannot imagine my absence  it s my fault  jim  home so much  limping around  ruined knees  overweight  under the
influence  burping  nonslim  sweat soaked in that broiler of a trailer  burping  farting  frustrated  miserable  knocking lamps over 
overshooting my reach  afraid to give my last talent the one shot it demanded  talent is its own expectation  jim  you either live
up to it or it waves a hankie  receding forever  use it or lose it  he d say over the newspaper  i m     i m just afraid of having a
tombstone that says here lies a promising old man  it s     potential may be worse than none  jim  than no talent to
fritter in the first place  lying around guzzling because i haven t the balls to     god i m i m so sorry  jim  you don t deserve to see
me like this  i m so scared  jim  i m so scared of dying without ever being really seen  can you understand  are you enough of a
big thin prematurely stooped young bespectacled man  even with your whole life still ahead of you  to understand  can you see i
was giving it all i had  that i was in there  out there in the heat  listening  webbed with nerves  a self that touches all edges  i
remember she said  i felt it in a way i fear you and your generation never could  son  it was less like falling than being shot out of
something  is the way i recall it  it did not did not happen in slow motion  one minute i was at a dead and beautiful forward run
for the ball  the next minute there were hands at my back and nothing underfoot like a push down a stairway  a rude whip lashing
shove square in the back and my promising body with all its webs of nerves pulsing and firing was in full airborne flight and came
down on my knees this flask is empty right down on my knees with all my weight and inertia on that scabrous hot sandpaper
surface forced into what was an exact parody of an imitation of contemplative prayer  sliding forward  the flesh and then tissue
and bone left twin tracks of brown red gray white like tire tracks of bodily gore extending from the service line to the net  i slid on
my flaming knees  rushed past the dribbling ball and toward the net that ended my slide  our slide  my racquet had gone
pinwheeling off jim and my racquetless arms out before me sliding jim in the attitude of a mortified monk in total prayer  it was
given me to hear my father pronounce my bodily existence as not even potentially great at the moment i ruined my knees forever 
jim  so that even years later at usc i never got to wave my hankie at anything beyond the near  and almost great and would havebeen great     and later could never even hope to audition for those swim trunk and brylcreem beach movies that snake avalon is
making his mint on  i do not insist that the judgment and punishing fall are     were connected  jim  any man can slip out there 
all it takes is a second of misplaced respect  son  it was more than a father s voice  carrying  my mother cried out  it was a
religious moment  i learned what it means to be a body  jim  just meat wrapped in a sort of flimsy nylon stocking  son  as i fell
kneeling and slid toward the stretched net  myself seen by me  frame by frame  torn open  i may have to burp  belch  son  son 
telling you what i learned  son  my      my love  too late  as i left my knees  meat behind me  slid  ended in a posture of
supplication on my knees  disclosed bones with my fingers racquetless hooked through the mesh of the net  across which  the net 

 the sopped dandy had dropped his pricey gut strung davis racquet and was running toward me with his visor askew and his hands
to his cheeks  my father and the client he was there to perform for dragged me upright to the palm s infected shade where she
knelt on the plaid beach blanket with her knuckles between her teeth  jim  and i felt the religion of the physical that day  at not
much more than your age  jim  shoes filling with blood  held under the arms by two bodies big as yours and dragged off a public
court with two extra lines  it s a pivotal  it s a seminal  religious day when you get to both hear and feel your destiny at the same
moment  jim  i got to notice what i m sure you ve noticed long ago  i know  i know you ve seen me brought home on occasions 
dragged in the door  under what s called the influence  son  helped in by cabbies at night  i ve seen your long shadow grotesquely
backlit at the top of the house s stairs i helped pay for  boy  how the drunk and the maimed both are dragged forward out of the
arena like a boneless christ  one man under each arm  feet dragging  eyes on the aether 

  november year of the depend adult undergarment
from cambridge s latinate inman square  michael pemulis  nobody s fool at all  rides one necessary bus to central square
and then an unnecessary bus to davis square and a train back to central  this is to throw off the slightest possible chance of
pursuit  at central he catches the red line to park st  station  where he s parked the tow truck in an underground lot he can more
than afford  the day is autumnal and mild  the east breeze smelling of urban commerce and the vague suede smell of new fallen
leaves  the sky is pilot light blue  sunlight reflects complexly off the smoked glass sides of tall centers of commerce all around
park st  downtown  pemulis wears button fly chinos and an e t a  shirt beneath a snazzy blue brioni sport coat  plus the brightwhite yachting cap that mario incandenza calls his mr  howell hat  the hat looks rakish even when turned around  and it has a
detachable lining  inside the lining can be kept portable quantities of just about anything  having indulged in     nig  of very mild
 drines  post transaction  wearing also gray and blue saddle oxfords w o socks  it s such a mild autumn day  the streets literally
bustle  vendors with carts instead of tubs sell hot pretzels and tonics and those underboiled franks pemulis likes to have them put
the works on  you can see the state house and common and courthouse and public gardens  and beyond all that the cool smooth
facades of back bay brownstones  the echoes in the underground park pl garage   park   are pleasantly complex  traffic
westward on commonwealth avenue is light  meaning things can move  all the way through ken more square and past boston
u  and up the long slow hill into allston and enfield  when tavis and schtitt and the players and ground crew and testar and
athscme teams inflate the all weather lung for the winter over courts        the domed lung s nacelle is visible against the
horizon all the way down by the brighton ave  comm  ave  split in lower allston 
the incredibly potent dmz is apparently classed as a para methoxylated amphetamine but really it looks to pemulis from his
slow and tortured survey of the med com s monographs more like more similar to the anticholinergic deliriant class  way more
powerful than mescaline or mda or dma or tma or mdma or dom or stp or the i v  ingestible dmt  or ololiuqui or
datura s scopolamine  or fluothane  or bufotenine  a k a   jackie o     or ebene or psilocybin or cylert      dmz resembling
chemically some miscegenation of a lysergic with a muscimoloid  but significantly different from lsd    in that its effects are
less visual and spatially cerebral and more like temporally cerebral and almost ontological  with some sort of manipulatedphenylkylamine like speediness whereby the ingester perceives his relation to the ordinary flow of time as radically  and
euphorically  is where the muscimole affective resemblance shows its head  altered      the incredibly potent dmz is
synthesized from a derivative of fitviavi  an obscure mold that grows only on other molds  by the same ambivalently lucky
chemist at sandoz pharm  who d first stumbled on lsd  as a relatively ephebic and clueless organic chemist  while futzing around
with ergotic fungi on rye  dmz s discovery was the tail end of the b s      s  just about the same time dr  alan watts was
considering t  leary s invitation to become  writer in resonance  at leary s utopian lsd    colony in millbrook ny on what is
now canadian soil  a substance even just the accidental synthesis of which sent the sandoz chemist into early retirement and
serious unblinking wall watching  the incredibly potent dmz has a popular lay chemical underground reputation as the single
grimmest thing ever conceived in a tube  it is also now the hardest recreational compound to acquire in north america after raw
vietnamese opium  which forget it 
dmz is sometimes also referred to in some metro boston chemical circles as madame psychosis  after a popular very earlymorning cult radio personality on m i t  s student run radio station wyyy       largest whole prime on the fm band   which
mario incandenza and e t a  stats wienie and eschaton game master otis p  lord listen to almost religiously 
the day shift ennet house kid at the booth who raises the portcullis to let him onto the grounds had a couple times in october
approached pemulis about a potential transaction  pemulis has a rigid policy about not transacting with e t a  employees who
come up the hill from the halfway house  since he knows some of them are at the place on court order  and knows for a fact they
pull unscheduled urines all over the place down there  and types like the ennet house types are just the sorts of people pemulis s
talents let him get away from in terms of like social milieu and mixing and transacting  and his basic attitude with these low rent
employees is one of unfoolish discretion and like why tempt fate 
the east courts are empty and ball strewn when pemulis pulls in  most of them are still at lunch  pemulis  troeltsch  and
schacht s triple room is in subdorm b in the back north part of the second floor of west house and so superjacent to the dining
hall  from which through the floor pemulis can hear voices and silverware and can smell exactly what they re having  the first
thing he does is boot up the phone console and try inc and mario s room over in comm  ad   where hal is sitting in windowlight
with the riverside hamlet he told mario he d read and help with a conceptual film type project based on part of  his uncushioned
captain s chair partly under an old print of a detail from the minor and soft core alexandrian mosaic consummation of the
levirates  eating an aminopal  energy bar and waiting very casually  the phone with its antenna already out lying ready on the
arm of the chair and two folio size baron s sat prep guides and a spine shot copy of the b s       tilden on spin and his keys
on their neck chain lying on the lindistarne carpet by his shoe  waiting in a very casual posture  hal deliberately waits till the

summer breath  hit serves to no one  make a mess of balls along the base of the opposite fence as the sun hauls itself up over the
harbor and a thin sweat breaks and the serves start to boom  stop thinking and let it flow and go boom  boom  the shiver of the
ball against the opposite fence  hit about a thousand serves to no one while himself sits and advises with his flask  older men s
legs are white and hairless from decades in pants  here is the set of keys a stride s length before you in the court as you serve dead
balls to no one  after each serve you must almost fall forward into the court and in one smooth motion bend and scoop up the keys
with your left hand  this is how to train yourself to follow through into the court after the serve  you still  years after the man s
death  cannot keep your keys anywhere but on the floor 
this is how to hold the stick

deserves a sobriquet 
please look  you ll be shown exactly once how to hold it  this is how to hold it  just like this  forget all the near easternslice backhand grip bafflegab  just say hello is all  just shake hands with the calfskin grip of the stick  this is how to hold it  the
stick is your friend  you will become very close 
grasp your friend firmly at all times  a firm grip is essential for both control and power  here is how to carry a tennis ball
around in your stick hand  squeezing it over and over for long stretches of time   in class  on the phone  in lab  in front of the tp 
a wet ball for the shower  ideally squeezing it at all times except during meals  see the academy dining hall  where tennis balls sit
beside every plate  squeeze the tennis ball rhythmically month after year until you feel it no more than your heart squeezing blood
and your right forearm is three times the size of your left and your arm looks from across a court like a gorilla s arm or a
stevedore s arm pasted on the body of a child 
here is how to do extra individual drills before the academy s a m  drills  before breakfast  so that after the thousandth ball
hit just out of reach by himself  with his mammoth wingspan and ghastly calves  urging you with nothing but smiles on to great

enfield is due east of the marathon s hills of heartbreak  which are just up commonwealth past the reservoir in newton  urban
jogging in a sweaty pack is tedious  have himself hunch down to put a long pale arm around your shoulders and tell you that his
own father had told him that talent is sort of a dark gift  that talent is its own expectation  it is there from the start and either lived
up to or lost 
have a father whose own father lost what was there  have a father who lived up to his own promise and then found thing
after thing to meet and surpass the expectations of his promise in  and didn t seem just a whole hell of a lot happier or tighter
wrapped than his own failed father  leaving you yourself in a kind of feral and flux ridden state with respect to talent 
here is how to avoid thinking about any of this by practicing and playing until everything runs on autopilot and talent s
unconscious exercise becomes a way to escape yourself  a long waking dream of pure play 
the irony is that this makes you very good  and you start to become regarded as having a prodigious talent to live up to 
here is how to handle being a feral prodigy  here is how to handle being seeded at tournaments  signifying that seeding
committees composed of old big armed men publicly expect you to reach a certain round  reaching at least the round you re
supposed to is known at tournaments as  justifying your seed   by repeating this term over and over  perhaps in the same rhythm at
which you squeeze a ball  you can reduce it to an empty series of phonemes  just formants and fricatives  trochaically stressed 
signifying zip

here is how to tie a bow tie  here is how to sit through small openings of your father s first art films  surrounded by surly
foreign cigarette smoke and conversations so pretentious you literally cannot believe them  you re sure you have misheard them 
pretend you re engaged by the jagged angles and multiple exposures without pretending you have the slightest idea what s going
on  assume your brother s expression

quickly 
this type of stretch helps prevent the groin pull

jump rope for two hours then jog backwards through newton till i puke they ll let me watch match cartridges and then my mother

here is how to schnell

it is easier than you think

his multiple exposure melodramas  learn to care and not to care  they mean the rankings to help you determine where you are

sometimes words that seem to express really invoke

here is how to get free sticks and strings and clothes and gear from dunlop  inc  as long as you let them spraypaint the
distinctive dunlop logo on your sticks  strings and sew logos on your shoulder and the left pocket of your shorts and use a dunlop
gear bag  and you become a walking lunging sweating advertisement for dunlop  inc   this is all as long as you keep justifying
your seed and preserving your rank  the dunlop  inc  new new england regional athletic rep will address you as  our gray

be a student of the game  like most cliches of sport  this is profound  you can be shaped  or you can be broken  there is not
much in between  try to learn  be coachable  try to learn from everybody  especially those who fail  this is hard  peers who
fizzle or blow up or fall down  run away  disappear from the monthly rankings  drop off the circuit  e t a  peers waiting for
delint to knock quietly at their door and ask to chat  opponents  it s all educational  how promising you are as a student of the
game is a function of what you can pay attention to without running away  nets and fences can be mirrors  and between the nets
and fences  opponents are also mirrors  this is why the whole thing is scary  this is why all opponents are scary and weaker
opponents are especially scary 
see yourself in your opponents  they will bring you to understand the game  to accept the fact that the game is about
managed fear  that its object is to send from yourself what you hope will not return 
this is your body  they want you to know  you will have it with you always 
on this issue there is no counsel  you must make your best guess  for myself  i do not expect ever really to know 
but in the interval  if it is an interval  here is motrin for your joints  noxzema for your burn  lemon pledge if you prefer

 but there s this way he drums his fingers on the table  not even like really drumming  more like in way between drumming
and like this scratching  picking  the way you see somebody picking at dead skin  and without any kind of rhythm  see  constant
and never stopping but with no kind of rhythm you could grab onto and follow and stand  totally like whacked  insane  like the
kind of sounds you can imagine a girl hears in her head right before she kills her whole family because somebody took the last bit
of peanut butter or something  you know what i m saying  the sound of a fucking mind coming apart  you know what i m
saying  so yeah  yes  ok  the short answer is when he wouldn t quit with the drumming at supper i sort of poked him with my
fork  sort of  i could see how maybe somebody could have thought i sort of stabbed him  i offered to get the fork out  though  let
me just say i m ready to make amends at like anytime  for my part in it  i m owning my part in it is what i m saying  can i ask am
i going to get restricted for this  cause i have this overnight tomorrow that gene he approved already in the overnight log  if
you want to look  but i m not trying to get out of owning my part of the  like  occurrence  if my higher power who i choose to
call god works through you saying i ve got some kind of a punishment due  i won t try to get out of a punishment  if i ve got one
due  i just wanted to ask  did i mention i m grateful to be here  
 i m not denying anything  i m simply asking you to define  alcoholic   how can you ask me to attribute to myself a given
term if you refuse to define the term s meaning  i ve been a reasonably successful personal injury attorney for sixteen years  and
except for that one ridiculous so called seizure at the bar association dinner this spring and that clot of a judge banning me from
his courtroom   and let me just say that i can support my contention that the man masturbates under his robe behind the bench
with detailed corroboration from both colleagues and circuit court laundry personnel   with the exception of less than a handful
of incidents i ve held my liquor and my head as high as many a taller advocate  believe you me  how old are you  young lady  i
am not in denial so to speak about anything empirical and objective  am i having pancreas problems  yes  do i have trouble
recalling certain intervals in the kemp and limbaugh administrations  no contest  is there a spot of domestic turbulence
surrounding my intake  why yes there is  did i experience yes some formication in detox  i did  i have no problem forthrightly
admitting things i can grasp  forwicate  with an m  yes  but what is this you demand i admit  is it denial to delay signature until
the vocabulary of the contract is clear to all parties so bound  yes  yes  you don t follow what i mean here  good  and you re
reluctant to proceed without clarification  i rest  i cannot deny what i don t understand  this is my position  
 so i m sitting there waiting for my meatloaf to cool and suddenly there s a simply sphincter loosening shriek and here s nell
in the air with a steak fork  positively aloft  leaping across the table  in flight  horizontal  i mean pat the girl s body is literally
parallel to the surface of the table  hurling herself at me  with this upraised fork  shrieking something about the sound of peanut
butter  i mean my god  gately and diehl had to pull the fork out of my hand and the tabletop both  to give you an idea  of the
savagery  don t even ask me about the pain  let s don t even get into that  i assure you  they offered me percocet     at the
emergency room  is all i ll say about the levels of pain involved  i told them i was in recovery and powerless over narcotics of any
sort  please don t even ask me how moved they were at my courage if you don t want me to get weepy  this whole experience has
me right on the edge of a complete hysterical fit  so but yes  guilty  i may very well have been tapping on the table  excuse me for
occupying space  and then she ever so magnaminously says she ll apologize if i will  well come again i said  come again  i
mean my god  i m sitting there attached to the table by tines  i know bashing  pat  and this was unabashed bashing at its most
fascist  i respectfully ask that she be kicked out of here on her enormous rear end  let her go back to whatever fork wielding
district she came from  with her hefty bag full of gauche clothes  honestly  i know part of this process is learning to live in a
community  the give and take  to let go of personality issues  turn them over  et cetera  but is it not also supposed to be and here i
quote the handbook a safe and nurturing environment  i have seldom felt less nurtured than i did impaled on that table i have to
say  the pathetic harassments of minty and mcdade are bad enough  i can get bashed back at the fenway  i did not come here to
get bashed on some pretense of table tapping  i m dangerously close to saying either that       that specimen goes or i do  
 i m awful sorry to bother  i can come back  i was wondering if maybe there was any special program prayer for when you
want to hang yourself  
 i want understanding i have no denial i am drug addict  me  i know that i am addicted since the period of before miami  i am
no trouble to stand up in the meetings and say i am alfonso  i am drug addict  powerless  i am knowing powerlessness since the
period of castro  but i cannot stop even since i know  this i have fear  i fear i do not stop when i admit i am alfonso  powerless 
how does to admit i am powerless make me stop what the thing is i am powerless to stop  my head it is crazy from this fearing of
no power  i am now hope for power  mrs  pat  i want to advice  is hope of power the bad way for alfonso as drug addict  
 sorry to barge  there  p m  division called again about the thing with the vermin  the word was ultimatum that they said  
 sorry if i m bothering you about something that isn t a straightforward treatment interface thing  i m up there trying to do my
chore  i ve got the men s upstairs bathroom  there s something      pat there s something in the toilet up there  that won t flush 
the thing  it won t go away  it keeps reappearing  flush after flush  i m only here for instructions  possibly also protective
equipment  i couldn t even describe the thing in the toilet  all i can say is if it was produced by anything human then i have to say
i m really worried  don t even ask me to describe it  if you want to go up and have a look  i m a      confident it s still there  it s
made it real clear it s not going anywhere  
 alls i know is i put a hunt s pudding cup in the resident fridge like i m supposed to at      and da da da and at      i come
down all primed for pudding that i paid for myself and it s not there and mcdade comes on all concerned and offers to help me
look for it and da da  except if you look i look and here s the son of a whore got this big thing of pudding on his chin  
 yeah but except so how can i answer just yes or no to do i want to stop the coke  do i think i want to absolutely i think i
want to  i don t have a septum no more  my septum s been like fucking dissolved by coke  see  you see anything like a septum
when i lift up like that  i ve absolutely with my whole heart thought i wanted to stop and so forth  ever since with the septum  so
but so since i ve been wanting to stop this whole time  why couldn t i stop  see what i m saying  isn t it all about wanting to and

 so on  and so forth  how can living here and going to meetings and all do anything except make me want to stop  but i think i
already want to stop  how come i d even be here if i didn t want to stop  isn t being here proof i want to stop  but then so how
come i can t stop  if i want to stop  is the thing

anyone being told to pray for relief from cancer  outside maybe certain very rural parts of the american south  that is  so what is
this  you re ordering me to pray  because i allegedly have a disease  i dismantle my life and career and enter nine months of

wonnie we s down at t pub that night wonnie says he says that seventy thwee sounded just like fucking bombs sounded  that kind
of cwacking whump  when they hit  to the boys in the squadwon in the planes when they let them go  
the radio show right before madame psychosis s midnight show on m i t  s semi underground wyyy is  those were the
legends that formerly were   one of those cruel tech collegiate formats where any u s  student who wants to can dart over from
the super collider lab or the fourier transforms study group for fifteen minutes and read on air some parodic thing where he d
pretend to be his own dad apotheosizing some sort of thick necked historic athletic figure the dad d admired and had by
implication compared with woeful distaste to the pencil necked big headed asthmatic little kid staring up through coke bottle
lenses from his digital keyboard  the show s only rule is that you have to read your thing in the voice of some really silly cartoon
character  there are other  rather more exotic patricidal formats for asian  latin  arab  and european students on select weekend

 evenings  the consensus is asian cartoon characters have the silliest voices 
albeit literally sophomoric   those were the legends        is a useful drama therapy type catharsis op   m i t  students tend
to carry their own special psychic scars  nerd  geek  dweeb  wonk  fag  wienie  four eyes  spazola  limp dick  needle dick 
dickless  dick nose  pencil neck  getting your violin or laptop tp or entomologist s kill jar broken over your large head by thicknecked kids on the playground   and the show pulls down solid fm ratings  though a lot of that s due to reverse inertia  a
newton sti like backward shove from the rabidly popular madame psychosis hour  m f     h      h   which it precedes 
y d a u  s wyyy late shift student engineer  unfond of any elevator that follows a serpentine or vascular path  eschews the
m i t  student union s elevator  he has an arrival routine where he skips the front entrances and comes in through the south side s
acoustic meatus and gets a millennial fizzy  out of the vending machine in the sephenoid sinus  then descends creaky back
wooden stairs from the massa intermedia s reading room down to about the infundibular recess  past the tech talk daily cdrom student paper s production floor and the sick chemical smell of the read only cartridge press s developer  down past the
epiglottal hillel club s dark and star doored hq  past the heavier door to the tiled lattice of hallways to the squash and racquetball
courts and one volleyball court and the airy corpus callosum of    high ceiling tennis courts endowed by an m i t  alum and now
so little used they don t even know now where the nets are  down three more levels to the ghostly clean and lithium lit studios of
fm     wyyy fm  broadcasting for the m i t  community and selected points beyond  the studio s walls are pink and
laryngeally fissured  his asthma s better down here  the air thin and keen  the tracheal air filters just below the flooring and the
ventilators  air the freshest in the union 
the engineer  a work study graduate student with bad lungs and occluded pores  settles alone at his panel in the engineer s
booth  adjusts a couple needles  bob  and sound checks the only paid personality on the nightly docket  the darkly revered
madame psychosis  whose cameo shadow is just visible outside the booth s thick glass  her screen half obscuring the on air
studio s bank of phones  checking cueing and transition for the thursday edition  she is hidden from all view by a jointed triptych
screen of cream chiffon that glows red and green in the lights of the phone bank and the cueing panel s dials and frames her
silhouette  her silhouette is cleanly limned against the screen  sitting cross legged in its in sectile microphonic headset  smoking 
the engineer always has to tighten his own headset s cranial band down from the  those were  engineer s mammoth parietal
breadth  he activates the intercom and offers to check madame psychosis s levels  he requests sound  anything at all  he hasn t
opened his can of pop  there is a long silence during which madame psychosis s silhouette doesn t look up from something she
looks like she s collating at her little desk 
after a while she makes some little sounds  little plosives to check for roaring sounds in exhalations  a perennial problem in
low budget fm 
she makes a long s sound 
the student engineer takes a hit from his portable inhaler 
she says  he liked that sort of dreamy  dreaming music that had the rhythm of long things swinging  
the engineer s movements at the panel s dials resemble someone adjusting the heater and sound system while driving 
 the dow that can be told is not the eternal dow   she says 
the engineer  age twenty three  has extremely bad skin 
 attractive paraplegic female seeks same  object  
the windowless laryngeal studio is terribly bright  nothing casts a shadow  recessed lit fluorescence with a dual spectrum
lithiumized corona  developed two buildings over and awaiting o n a n  patent  the chilly shadowless light of surgical theaters 
convenience stores at       the pink wrinkled walls sometimes look more gynecological than anything else 
 like most marriages  theirs was the evolved product of concordance and compromise  
the engineer shivers in the bright chill and lights a gasper of his own and tells madame psychosis through the intercom that
the whole range of levels is fine  madame psychosis is the only wyyy personality who brings in her own headset and jacks  plus
a triptych screen  over the screen s left section are four clocks set for different zones  plus a numberless disk someone hung for a
joke  to designate the annularized great concavity s no time  the e s t  clock s trackable hand carves off the last few seconds
from the five minutes of dead air madame psychosis s contract stipulates gets to precede her show  you can see her silhouette
putting out the cigarette very methodically  she cues tonight s synthesized bumper and theme music  the engineer flicks a lever
and pumps the music up the coaxial medulla and through the amps and boosters packed into the crawlspaces above the high false
ceiling of the corpus callosum s idle tennis courts and up and out the aerial that protrudes from the gray and bulbous surface of the
union s roof  institutional design has come a ways from i  m  pei  m i t  s near new student union  off the corner of ames and
memorial dr       east cambridge  is one enormous cerebral cortex of reinforced concrete and polymer compounds  madame
psychosis is smoking again  listening  head cocked  her tall screen will leak smoke for her show s whole hour  the student
engineer is counting down from five on an outstretched hand he can t see how she sees  and as pinkie meets palm  she says what
she s said for three years of midnights  an opening bit that mario incandenza  the least cynical person in the history of enfield
ma  across the river  listening faithfully  finds  for all its black cynicism  terribly compelling 
her silhouette leans and says  and lo  for the earth was empty of form  and void 
 and darkness was all over the face of the deep 
 and we said   look at that fucker dance  
a toneless male voice is then cued in to say it s sixty minutes more or less with madame psychosis on yyy      largest
whole prime on the fm band  the different sounds are encoded and pumped by the student engineer up through the building s
corpus and out the roof s aerial  this aerial  low watt  has been rigged by the station s em wienies to tilt and spin  not unlike a
centrifugal theme park type ride  spraying the signal in all directions  since the b s       hundt act  the low watt fringes of the
fm band are the only part of the wireless spectrum still licensed for public broadcast  the deep water green of fm tuners all over
the campus s labs and dorms and barnacled clots of grad apartments align themselves slowly toward the spatter s center  moving
toward the dial s right  a little creepily  like plants toward light they can t even see  ratings are minor league by the pre interlace
broadcast standards of yore  but they are rock solid consistent  audience demand for madame psychosis has been  from the very
start  inelastic  the aerial  inclined at about the angle of a   km  cannon  spins in a blurred ellipse   its rotary base is elliptical

 because that s the only shape the em wienies could rig a mold for  obstructed on all sides by the tall buildings of east cambridge
and commercial drive and serious downtown  though  only a couple thin pie slices of signal escape m i t  proper  e g  through
the p e  dept  gap of barely used lacrosse and soccer fields between the philology and low temp physics complexes on mem 
dr  and then across the florid purple nighttime breadth of the historic charles river  then through the heavy flow of traffic on
storrow dr  on the chuck s other side  so that by the time the signal laps at upper brighton and enfield you need almost
surveillance grade antennation to filter it in out of the em miasma of cellular and interconsole phone transmissions and tps  emauras that crowd the fm fringes from every side  unless  that is  your tuner is lucky enough to be located at the apex of a tall and
more or less denuded hill  in enfield  in which case you find yourself right in yyy s centrifugal line of fire 
madame psychosis eschews chatty openings and contextual filler  her hour is compact and no nonsense 
after the music fades  her shadow holds collated sheets up and riffles them slightly so the sound of paper is broadcast 
 obesity   she says   obesity with hypogonadism  also morbid obesity  nodular leprosy with leonine fades   the engineer can see
her silhouette lift a cup as she pauses  which reminds him of the millennial fizzy in his bookbag 
she says  the acromegalic and hyperkeratosistic  the enuretic  this year of all years  the spasmodically torticollic  
the student engineer  a pre doctoral transuranial metallurgist working off massive g s l  debt  locks the levels and fills out
the left side of his time sheet and ascends with his bookbag through a treillage of interneural stairways with semitic ideograms
and developer smell and past snack bar and billiard hall and modem banks and extensive student counseling offices around the
rostral lamina  all the little used many staired neuroform way up to the artery red fire door of the union s rooftop  leaving
madame psychosis  as is s o p   alone with her show and screen in the shadowless chill  she s mostly alone in there when she s
on air  every so often there s a guest  but the guest will usually get introduced and then not say anything  the monologues seem
both free associative and intricately structured  not unlike nightmares  there s no telling what ll be up on a given night  if there s
one even remotely consistent theme it s maybe film and film cartridges  early and  mostly italian  neorealist and  mostly german 
expressionist celluloid film  never new wave  thumbs up on peterson broughton and dali  bunuel and  down on
deren hammid  passionate about antonioni s slower stuff and some russian guy named tarkovsky  sometimes ozu and bresson 
odd affection for the hoary dramaturgy of one sir herbert tree  bizarre kaelesque admiration for goremeisters peckinpah  de
palma  tarantino  positively poisonous on the subject of fellini s        exceptionally conversant w r t avant garde celluloid and
avant  and apres garde digital cartridges  anticonfluential cinema      brutalism  found drama  etc  also highly literate on u s 
sports  football in particular  which fact the student engineer finds dissonant  madame takes one phone call per show  at random 
mostly she solos  the show kind of flies itself  she could do it in her sleep  behind the screen  sometimes she seems very sad  the
engineer likes to monitor the broadcast from a height  the union s rooftop  summer sun and winter wind  the more correct term
for an asthmatic s inhaler is  nebulizer   the engineer s graduate research specialty is the carbonated translithium particles created
and destroyed billions of times a second in the core of a cold fusion ring  most of the lithioids can t be smashed or studied and
exist mostly to explain gaps and incongruities in annulation equations  once last year  madame psychosis had the student engineer
write out the home lab process for turning uranium oxide powder into good old fissionable u      then she read it on the air
between a baraka poem and a critique of the steeler defense s double slot secondary  it s something a bright high schooler could
cook and took less than three minutes to read on air and didn t involve one classified procedure or one piece of hardware not
gettable from any decent chemical supply outlet in boston  but there was no small unpleasantness about it from the m i t 
administration  which it s well known m i t  is in bed with defense  the hot fuel recipe was the one bit of verbal intercourse the
engineer s had with madame psychosis that didn t involve straight levels and cues 
the union s soft latex polymer roof is cerebrally domed and a cloudy pia mater pink except in spots where it s eroded down
to pasty gray  and everywhere textured  the bulging rooftop  with sulci and bulbous convolutions  from the air it looks wrinkled 
from the roof s fire door it s an almost nauseous system of serpentine trenches  like water slides in hell  the union itself  the late
a y    v f    rickey s summum opus  is a great hollow brain frame  an endowed memorial to the north american seat of very
high tech  and is not as ghastly as out of towners suppose it must be  though the vitreally inflated balloon eyes  deorbited and
hung by twined blue cords from the second floor s optic chiasmae to flank the wheelchair accessible front ramp  take a bit of
getting used to  and some like the engineer never do get comfortable with them and use the less garish auditory side doors  and the
abundant sulcus fissures and gyrus bulges of the slick latex roof make rain drainage complex and footing chancy at best  so
there s not a whole lot of recreational strolling up here  although a kind of safety balcony of skull colored polybutylene resin 
which curves around the midbrain from the inferior frontal sulcus to the parietooccipital sulcus   a halo ish ring at the level of
like eaves  demanded by the cambridge fire dept  over the heated pro mimetic protests of topological rickeyites over in the
architecture dept   which the m i t  administration  trying to placate rickeyites and c f d  fire marshal both  had had the premolded resin injected with dyes to render it the distinctively icky brown shot off white of living skull  so that the balcony
resembles at once corporeal bone and numinous aura    which balcony means that even the worst latex slip and slide off the
steeply curved cerebrum s edge would mean a fall of only a few meters to the broad butylene platform  from which a venous blue
emergency ladder can be detached and lowered to extend down past the superior temporal gyrus and pons and abducent to hook
up with the polyurethane basilar stem artery and allow a safe shimmy down to the good old oblongata just outside the rubberized
meatus at ground zero 
topside in the bitter river wind  wearing a khaki parka with a fake fur fringe  the student engineer makes his way and settles
into the first intra parietal sulcus that catches his fancy  makes a kind of nest in the soft trench   the convoluted latex is filled
with those little non fhc styrofoam peanuts everything industrially soft is filled with  and the pia mater surface gives rather like
one of those old bean bag chairs of more innocent times   settles in and back with his millennial fizzy and inhaler and cigarette
and pocket size heathkit digital fm band receiver under a high co night sky that makes the stars  points look extra sharp  the
boston p m  is    c  the postcentral sulcus he sits in is just outside the circumference of the yyy aerial s high speed spin  so
five m  overhead its tip s aircraft light describes a blurred oval  vascularly hued  his fm receiver s power cells  tested daily against
the low temp lab s mercuric resistors  are fresh  the wooferless tuner s sound tinny and crisp  so that madame sounds like a
faithful but radically miniaturized copy of her studio self

the pulsing aircraft alert light of the aerial is magenta  a sharp and much closer star  now  with his fingers laced behind his
head  reclined and gazing upward  listening  the centrifugal whirl s speed making its tip s light trail color across the eyes  the
light s oval a bloody halo over the very barest of all possible heads  madame psychosis has done u h i d  stuff before  once or
twice  he is listening to her read four levels below the oblangated recess that becomes the heating shaft s nubbin of spine  ad libstyle reading from one of the pr circulars of the union of the hideously and improbably deformed  an agnostic style    step
support group deal for what it calls the  aesthetically challenged       she sometimes reads circulars and catalogues and pr type
things  though not regularly  some things take several successive shows to get through  ratings stay solid  listeners hang in  the
engineer s pretty sure he d hang in even if he weren t paid to  he does like to settle into a sulcus and smoke slowly and exhale up
past the blurred red ellipse of the aerial  monitoring  madame s themes are at once unpredictable and somehow rhythmic  more
like probability waves for subhadronics than anything else      the student engineer has never once seen madame psychosis
enter or leave wyyy  she probably takes the elevator  it s    october in the o n a n ite year of the depend adult
undergarment 
like most marriages  avril and the late james incandenza s was an evolved product of concordance and compromise  and the
scholastic curriculum at e t a  is the product of negotiated compromises between avril s academic hard assery and james s and
schtitt s keen sense of athletic pragmatics  it is because of avril   who quit m i t  entirely and went down to half time at
brandeis and even turned down an extremely plummy type stipended fellowship at radcliffe s bunting institute that first year to
design and assume the helm of e t a  s curriculum   that the enfield tennis academy is the only athletic focus type school in
north america that still adheres to the trivium and quadrivium of the hard ass classical l a s  tradition      and thus one of the
very few extant sports academies that makes a real stab at being a genuine pre college school and not just an iron curtainish jockfactory  but schtitt never let incandenza forget what the place was supposed to be about  and so avril s flinty mens sana pedagogy
wasn t diluted so much as ad valoremized  pragmatically focused toward the corpore potis type goals kids were coming up the hill
to give their childhoods for  some e t a  twists avril d allowed into the classic l a s  path are e g  that the seven subjects of the
t and q are mixed and not divided into quadrivial upper class v  trivial ephebic  that e t a  geometry classes pretty much
ignore the study of closed figures  excepting rectangles  to concentrate  also except for thorp s trigonometry of cubes  which is
elective and mostly aesthetic  for two increasingly brutal semesters on the involution and expansion of bare angles  that the
quadrivial requirement of astronomy has at e t a  become a two term elementary optics survey  since vision issues are obviously
more germane to the game  and since all the hardware required for everything from aphotic to apochromatic lens work were and
are right there in the lab off the comm  ad  tunnel  music s been pretty much bagged  plus the trivi umoid fetish for classical
oratory has by now at e t a  been converted to a wide range of history and studio courses in various types of entertainment 
mostly recorded film   again  way too much of incandenza s lavish equipment lying around not to exploit  plus the legally willed
and endowed for perpetuity presence on the academic payroll of mrs  pricket  mr  ogilvie  mr  disney r  leith  and ms  soma
richardson levy o byrne chawaf  the late founder director s loyal sound engineer  best boy  production assistant  and thirdfavorite actress  respectively 
plus also the six term entertainment requirement because students hoping to prepare for careers as professional athletes are
by intension training also to be entertainers  albeit of a deep and special sort  was incandenza s line  one of the few philosophical
points he had to pretty much ram down the throats of both avril and schtitt  who was pushing hard for some mix of theology and
the very grim ethics of kant 
mario incandenza has sat in on a back row stool for every session of an e t a  entertainment dept  offering ever since he
was finally three years ago december asked to disenroll from the winter hill special school in cam bridgeport for cheerfully
declining even to try to learn to really read  explaining he d way rather listen and watch  and he is a fanatical listener  observer 
he treats the lavish tatsuoka fringe fm band tuner in the living room of the headmaster s house like kids of three generations
past  listening the way other kids watch tp  opting for mono and sitting right up close to one of the speakers with his head cocked
dog like  listening  staring into that special pocket of near middle distance reserved for the serious listener  he really does have to
sit right up close to listen to  sixty minutes          when he s over at the hmh     with c t  and sometimes hal at his mother s
late suppers  because avril has some auditory thing about broadcast sound and gets the howling fantods from any voice that does
not exit a living corporeal head  and though avril s made it clear that mario s free at any time to activate and align the tatsuoka s
ghostly green tuner to whatever he wishes  he keeps the volume so low that he has to be lowered onto a low coffee table and lean
in and almost put his ear up against the woofer s tremble and concentrate closely to hear yyy s signal over the conversation in the
dining room  which tends to get sort of manically high pitched toward the end of supper  avril never actually asks mario to keep
it down  he does it out of unspoken consideration for her thing about sound  another of her unspoken but stressful things involves
issues of enclosure  and the hmh has no interior doors between rooms  and not even much in the way of walls  and the living and
dining rooms are separated only by a vast multileveled tangle of house plants in pots and on little stools of different heights and
arrayed under hanging uv lamps of an intensity that tends to give the diners strange little patterns of tan that differ according to
where someone usually sits at the table  hal sometimes complains privately to mario that he gets more than enough uv during the
day thank you very much  the plants are incredibly lush and hale and sometimes threaten to block off the whole easement from
dining to living room  and the rope handled brazilian machete c t  had mounted on the wall by the tremulous china case has
stopped really being a joke  the moms calls the houseplants her green babies  and she has a rather spectacular thumb  plant wise 
for a canadian 
 the leukodermatic  the xanthodantic  the maxillofacially swollen  those with distorted orbits of all kinds  get out from
under the sun s cove lighting is what this says  come in from the spectral rain   madame psy chosis s broadcast accent is not
boston  there are r s  for one thing  and there is no cultured cambridge stutter  it s the accent of someone who s spent time either

 losing a southern lilt or cultivating one  it s not flat and twangy like stice s  and it s not a drawl like the people at gainesville s
academy  her voice itself is sparely modulated and strangely empty  as if she were speaking from inside a small box  it s not bored
or laconic or ironic or tongue in cheek   the basilisk breathed and pyorrheic   it s reflective but not judgmental  somehow  her
voice seems low depth familiar to mario the way certain childhood smells will strike you as familiar and oddly sad   all ye
peronic or teratoidal  the phrenologically malformed  the sup puratively lesioned  the endocrinologically malodorous of
whatever ilk  run don t walk on down  the acervulus nosed  the radically  ectomied  the morbidly diaphoretic with a hankie in
every pocket  the chronically granulomatous  the ones it says here the ones the cruel call two baggers   one bag for your head 
one bag for the observer s head in case your bag falls off  the hated and dateless and shunned  who keep to the shadows  those
who undress only in front of their pets  the quote aesthetically challenged  leave your lazarettes and oubliettes  i m reading this
right here  your closets and cellars and tp tableaux  find nurturing and support and the inner resources to face your own
unblinking sight  is what this goes on to say  a bit overheatedly maybe  is it our place to say  it says here hugs not ughs  it says
come don the veil of the type and token  come learn to love what s hidden inside  to hold and cherish  the almost unbelievably
thick ankled  the kyphotic and lordotic  the irremediably cellulitic  it says progress not perfection  it says never perfection  the
fatally pulchritudinous  welcome  the actaeonizing  side by side with the medusoid  the papuled  the macu lar  the albinic 
medusas and odalisques both  come find common ground  all meeting rooms windowless  that s in ital  all meeting rooms
window less   plus the music she s cued for this inflectionless reading is weirdly compelling  you can never predict what it will
be  but over time some kind of pattern emerges  a trend or rhythm  tonight s background fits  somehow  as she reads  there s not
any real forwardness to it  you don t sense it s straining to get anywhere  the thing it makes you see as she reads is something
heavy swinging slowly at the end of a long rope  it s minor key enough to be eerie against the empty lilt of the voice and the clinks
of tines and china as mario s relations eat turkey salad and steamed crosiers and drink lager and milk and vin blanc from hull over
behind the plants bathed in purple light  mario can see the back of the moms s head high above the table  and then over to the left
hal s bigger right arm  and then hal s profile when he lowers it to eat  there s a ball by his plate  the e t a  players seem to need
to eat six or seven times a day  hal and mario had walked over for      supper at hmh after hal had read something for mr 
leith s class and then disappeared for about half an hour while mario stood supported by his police lock and waited for him 
mario rubs his nose with the heel of his hand  madame psychosis has an unironic but generally gloomy outlook on the universe in
general  one of the reasons mario s obsessed with her show is that he s somehow sure madame psychosis cannot herself sense the
compelling beauty and light she projects over the air  somehow  he has visions of interfacing with her and telling her she d feel a
lot better if she listened to her own show  he bets  madame psychosis is one of only two people mario would love to talk to but
would be scared to try  the word periodic pops into his head 
 hey hal   he calls across the plants 
like for months in the spring semester of y d p a h  she referred to her own program as  madame s downer lit hour  and
read depressing book after depressing book   good morning  midnight and maggie  a girl of the streets and giovanni s room
and under the volcano  plus a truly ghastly bret ellis period during lent   in a monotone  really slowly  night after night  mario
sits on the low little van der rohe knockoff coffee table with bowed legs  the table  with his head cocked right up next the speaker
and his claws in his lap  his toes tend to point inward when he sits  the background music is both predictable and  within that
predictability  surprising  it s periodic  it suggests expansion without really expanding  it leads up to the exact kind of inevitability
it denies  it is heavily digital  but with something of a choral bouquet  but unhuman  mario thinks of the word haunting  like in  a
haunting echo of thus and such   madame psy chosis s cued music   which the student engineer never chooses or even sees her
bring in   is always terribly obscure     but often just as queerly powerful and compelling as her voice and show itself  the
m i t  community feels  it tends to give you the feeling there s an in joke that you and she alone are in on  very few devoted
wyyy listeners sleep well m f  mario has horizontal breathing trouble sometimes  but other than that he sleeps like a babe 
avril incandenza still sticks with the old l islet region practice of taking just tea and nibbles at u s  suppertime and waiting to eat
seriously until right before bed  cultured canadians tend to think vertical digestion makes the mind unkeen  some of orin and
mario and hal s earliest memories are of nodding off at the dining room table and being gently carried by a very tall man to bed 
this was in a different house  madame psychosis s cued musics stir very early memories of mario s father  avril is more than
willing to take some good natured guff about her inability to eat before like    oh  prandial music holds little charm or
associations for hal  who like most of the kids on double daily drills makes fists around his utensils and eats like a wild dog 
 nor are excluded the utterly noseless  nor the hideously wall  and crosseyed  nor either the ergotic of st  anthony  the
leprous  the varicelliformally eruptive or even the sarcoma d of kaposi  
hal and mario probably eat listen late over at the hmh twice a week  avril likes to see them outside the awkward formality
of her position at e t a  c t  s the same at home and office  both avril and tavis s bedrooms are on the second floor  as a matter
of fact right next to each other  the only other room up there is avril s personal study  with a big color xerox of m  hamilton as
oz s west witch on the door and custom fiber wiring for a tri modem tp console  a stairway runs from her study down the
backside of hmh  north  down to a tributary tunnel leading to the main tunnel to comm  ad   so avril can commute over to
e t a  below ground  the hmh tunnel connects with the main at a point between the pump room and comm  ad   meaning
avril never like hunches idly past the pump room  which fact hal obviously endorses  late suppers at hmh for hal are limited
by delint to twice a week tops because they get him excused from dawn drills  which also means late night mischief possibilities 
sometimes they bring canada s john   no relation   wayne over with them  whom mrs  i  likes and speaks to animatedly even
though he rarely says anything the whole time he s there and also eats like a wild dog  sometimes neglecting utensils altogether 
avril also likes it when axford comes  axford has a hard time eating  and she likes to exhort him to eat  very rarely anymore
does hal bring pemulis or jim struck  to whom avril is so faultlessly  brittlely polite that the dining room s tension raises hair 
whenever avril parts ficus leaves to check  mario s still hunched pigeon toed and cocked in the same rca victorish posture 
with the little horizontal forehead crease that means he s either listening or thinking hard 
 the multiple amputee  the prosthetically malmatched  the snaggle toothed  wattled  weak chinned  and walrus cheeked 
the palate clefted  the really large pored  the excessively but not necessarily lycanthropically hirsute  the pin headed  the

ennet house drug and alcohol recovery house is the sixth of seven exterior units on the grounds of an enfield marine
public health hospital complex that  from the height of an athscme      industrial displacement fan or enfield tennis
academy s hilltop  resembles seven moons orbiting a dead planet  the hospital building itself  a va facility of iron colored brick
and steep slate roofs  is closed and cordoned  bright pine boards nailed across every possible access and aperture  with really stern
government signs about trespassing  enfield marine was built during either wwii or korea  when there were ample casualties and
much convalescence  about the only people who use the enfield marine complex in a va related way now seem to be wild eyed
old vietnam veterans in fatigue jackets de sleeved to make vests  or else drastically old korea vets who are now senile or
terminally alcoholic or both 
the hospital building itself stripped of equipment and copper wire  defunct  enfield marine stays solvent by maintaining
several smaller buildings on the complex s grounds   buildings the size of like prosperous homes  which used to house va
doctors and support staff   and leasing them to different state related health agencies and services  each building has a unitnumber that increases with the unit s distance from the defunct hospital and with its proximity  along a rutted cement roadlet that
extends back from the hospital s parking lot  to a steep ravine that overlooks a particularly unpleasant part of brighton ma s
commonwealth avenue and its green line train tracks 
unit  l  right by the lot in the hospital s afternoon shadow  is leased by some agency that seems to employ only guys who
wear turtlenecks  the place counsels wild eyed vietnam vets for certain very delayed stress disorders  and dispenses various
pacifying medications  unit    right next door  is a methadone clinic overseen by the same ma division of substance abuse
services that licenses ennet house  customers for the services of units    and    arrive around sunup and form long lines  the
customers for unit  l tend to congregate in like minded groups of three or four and gesture a lot and look wild eyed and generally
pissed off in some broad geopolitical way  the customers for the methadone clinic tend to arrive looking even angrier  as a rule 
and their early morning eyes tend to bulge and flutter like the eyes of the choked  but they do not congregate  rather stand or lean
along    s long walkway s railing  arms crossed  alone  brooding  solo acts  standoffish      or    people all managing to form a
line on a narrow walkway waiting for the same small building to unlock its narrow front door and yet still managing to appear
alone and stand offish is a strange sight  and if don gately had ever once seen a ballet he would  as an ennet house resident  from
his sunup smoking station on the fire escape outside the five man bedroom upstairs  have seen the movements and postures
necessary to maintain this isolation in union as balletic 
the other big difference between units   and    is that the customers of    leave the building deeply changed  their eyes not
only back in their heads but peaceful  if a bit glazed  but anyway in general just way better put together than when they arrived 
while  l s wild eyed patrons tend to exit  l looking even more stressed and historically aggrieved than when they went in 
when don gately was in the very early part of his ennet house residency he almost got discharged for teaming up with a
bad news methedrine addict from new bedford and sneaking out after curfew across the e m p h h  complex in the middle of the
night to attach a big sign on the narrow front door of unit    s methadone clinic  the sign said closed until further
notice by order commonwealth of massachusetts  the first staffer at the methadone clinic doesn t get there
to open up until o ooh   and yet it s been mentioned how    s customers always begin to show up with twisting hands and
bulging eyes at like dawn  to wait  and gately and the speed freak from new bedford had never seen anything like the psychic
crises and near riot among these semi ex junkies   pallid blade slender chain smoking homosexuals and bearded bruiser types in
leather berets  women with mohawks and multiple sticks of gum in  upscale trust fund fritterers with shiny cars and computerized

 jewelry who d arrived  as they d been doing like hyper conditioned rats for years  many of them  arrived at sunup with their eyes
protruding and with kleenexes at their noses and scratching their arms and standing on first one foot and then the other  doing
basically everything but truly congregating  wild for chemical relief  ready to stand in the cold exhaling steam for hours for that
relief  who d arrived with the sun and now seemed to be informed that the commonwealth of ma was suddenly going to withdraw
the prospect of that relief  until  and this is what really seemed to drive them right over the edge  out there in the lot  until further
notice  apeshit has rarely enjoyed so literal a denotation  at the sound of the first windowpane breaking and the sight of a blownout old whore trying to hit a leather vested biker with an old pre metric grass grows by inches but it dies by feet
sign from    s clinic s pathetic front lawn  the methedrine addict began laughing so hard that she dropped the binoculars from the
ennet house upstairs fire escape where they were watching  at like     h   and the binoculars fell and hit the roof of one of the
ennet house counselors  cars right below in the little roadlet  with a ringing clunk  just as he was pulling in  the counselor  his
name was calvin thrust and he was four years sober and a former nyc porn actor who d gone through the house himself and
now took absolutely zero in terms of shit from any of the residents  and his pride and joy was his customized  vette  and the
binoculars made rather a nasty dent  and plus they were the house manager s amateur ornithology binoculars and had been
borrowed out of the back office without explicit permission  and the long fall and impact didn t do them a bit of good  to say the
least  and gately and the methedrine addict got pinched and put on full house restriction and very nearly kicked out  the addict
from new bedford picked up the aminating needle a couple weeks after that anyway and was discovered by a night staffer
simultaneously playing air guitar and polishing the lids of all the donated canned goods in the house pantry way after lights out 
stark naked and sheened with meth sweat  and after the formality of a urine she was given the old administrative boot   over a
quarter of incoming ennet house residents get discharged for a dirty urine within their first thirty days  and it s the same at all
other boston halfway houses   and the girl ended up back in new bedford  and then within like three hours of hitting the streets
got picked up by new bedford s finest on an old default warrant and sent to framingham women s for a   to   bit  and got found
one morning in her bunk with a kitchen rigged shiv protruding from her privates and another in her neck and a thoroughly
eliminated personal map  and gately s individual counselor gene m  brought gately the news and invited him to see the
methedrine addict s demise as a clear case of there but for the grace of god goeth d  w  gately 
unit     across the roadlet from     is unoccupied but getting reconditioned for lease  it s not boarded up  and the enfield
marine maintenance guys go in there a couple days a week with tools and power cords and make a godawful racket  pat
montesian hasn t yet been able to find out what sort of group misfortune    will be devoted to servicing 
unit     more or less equidistant from both the hospital parking lot and the steep ravine  is a repository for alzheimer s
patients with va pensions     s residents wear jammies       the diapers underneath giving them a lumpy and toddlerish aspect 
the patients are frequently visible at    s windows  in jammies  splayed and open mouthed  sometimes shrieking  sometimes just
mutely open mouthed  splayed against the windows  they give everybody at ennet house the howling fantods  one ancient
retired air force nurse does nothing but scream  help   for hours at a time from a second story window  since the ennet house
residents are drilled in a boston aa recovery program that places great emphasis on  asking for help   the retired shrieking air
force nurse is the object of a certain grim amusement  sometimes  not six weeks ago  a huge stolen help wanted sign was
found attached to    s siding right below the retired shrieking nurse s window  and    s director was less than amused  and
demanded that pat montesian determine and punish the ennet house residents responsible  and pat had delegated the investigation
to don gately  and though gately had a pretty good idea who the perps were he didn t have the heart to really press and kick ass
over something so much like what he d done himself  when new and cynical  and so the whole thing pretty much blew over 
unit     kittycorner across the little street from ennet house  is for cata tonics and various vegetablish  fetal positioned
mental patients subcontracted to a commonwealth outreach agency by overcrowded ltis  unit    is referred to  for reasons
gately s never been able to pinpoint  as the shed      it is  understandably  a pretty quiet place  but in nice weather  when its
more portable inmates are carried out and placed in the front lawn to take the air  standing there propped up and staring  they
present a tableau it took gately some time to get used to  a couple newer residents got discharged late in gately s treatment for
tossing firecrackers into the crowd of catatonics on the lawn to see if they could get them to jump around or display affect  on
warm nights  one long limbed bespectacled lady who seems more autistic than catatonic tends to wander out of the shed wrapped
in a bedsheet and lay her hands on the thin shiny bark of a silver maple in    s lawn  stands there touching the tree until she s
missed at bedcheck and retrieved  and since gately graduated treatment and took the offer of a live in staffer s job at ennet house
he sometimes wakes up in his staff cellar bedroom down by the pay phone and tonic machine and looks out the sooty groundlevel window by his bed and watches the catatonic touching the tree in her sheet and glasses  illuminated by comm  ave  s neon
or the weird sodium light that spills down from the snooty tennis prep school overhead on its hill  he ll watch her standing there
and feel an odd chilled empathy he tries not to associate with watching his mother pass out on some piece of living room chintz 
unit     right up against the ravine on the end of the rutted road s east side  is ennet house drug and alcohol recovery
house  three stories of whitewashed new england brick with the brick showing in patches through the whitewash  a mansard roof
that sheds green shingles  a scabrous fire escape at each upper window and a back door no resident is allowed to use and a front
office around on the south side with huge protruding bay windows that yield a view of ravine weeds and the unpleasant stretch of
commonwealth ave  the front office is the director s office  and its bay windows  the house s single attractive feature  are kept
spotless by whatever residents get front office windows for their weekly chore  the mansard s lower slope encloses attics on
both the male and female sides of the house  the attics are accessed from trapdoors in the ceiling of the second floor and are filled
to the beams with trash bags and trunks  the unclaimed possessions of residents who ve up and vanished sometime during their
term  the shrubbery all around ennet house s first story looks explosive  ballooning in certain unpruned parts  and there are
candy wrappers and styrofoam cups trapped throughout the shrubs  green levels  and gaudy homemade curtains billow from the
second story s female side s bedroom windows  which are open what seems like all year round 
unit    is on the west side of the street s end  sunk in hill shadow and teetering right on the edge of the eroding ravine that
leads down to the avenue     is in bad shape  boarded up and unmaintained and deeply slumped at the red roof s middle as if
shrugging its shoulders at some pointless indignity  for an ennet house resident  entering unit     which can easily be entered
through the detachable pine board over an old kitchen window  is cause for immediate administrative discharge  since unit    is

 infamous for being the place where ennet house residents who want to secretly relapse with substances sneak in and absorb
substances and apply visine and clorets and then try to get back across the street in time for      curfew without getting
pinched 
behind unit    begins far and away the biggest hill in enfield ma  the hillside is fenced  off limits  densely wooded and
without sanctioned path  because a legit route involves walking north all the way up the rutted road through the parking lot  past
the hospital  down the steep curved driveway to warren street and all the way back south down warren to commonwealth 
almost half of all ennet house residents negotiate    s back fence and climb the hillside each morning  short cutting their way to
minimum wage temp jobs at like the provident nursing home or shuco mist medical pressure systems  etc   over the hill up
comm   or custodial and kitchen jobs at the rich tennis school for blond gleaming tennis kids on what used to be the hilltop  don
gately s been told that the school s maze of tennis courts lies now on what used to be the hill s hilltop before the academy s burly
cigar chomping tennis court contractors shaved the curved top off and rolled the new top flat  the whole long loud process sending
all sorts of damaging avalanche type debris rolling down and all over enfield marine s unit     something over which you can
sure bet the enfield marine va administration litigated  years back  and but gately doesn t know that e t a  s balding of the hill
is why    can still stand empty and unrepaired  enfield tennis academy still has to pay full rent  every month  on what it almost
buried

if  by the virtue of charity or the circumstance of desperation  you ever chance to spend a little time around a substancerecovery halfway facility like enfield ma s state funded ennet house  you will acquire many exotic new facts  you will find out
that once ma s department of social services has taken a mother s children away for any period of time  they can always take
them away again  d s s   like at will  empowered by nothing more than a certain signature stamped form  i e  once deemed unfit
  no matter why or when  or what s transpired in the meantime   there s nothing a mother can do 
or for instance that people addicted to a substance who abruptly stop ingesting the substance often suffer wicked papular
acne  often for months afterward  as the accumulations of substance slowly leave the body  the staff will inform you that this is
because the skin is actually the body s biggest excretory organ  or that chronic alcoholics  hearts are   for reasons no m d  has
been able to explain   swollen to nearly twice the size of civilians  human hearts  and they never again return to normal size  that
there s a certain type of person who carries a picture of their therapist in their wallet  that  both a relief and kind of an odd letdown  black penises tend to be the same general size as white penises  on the whole  that not all u s  males are circumcised 
that you can cop a sort of thin jittery amphetaminic buzz if you rapidly consume three millennial fizzies and a whole
package of oreo cookies on an empty stomach   keeping it down is required  however  for the buzz  which senior residents often
neglect to tell newer residents  
that the chilling hispanic term for whatever interior disorder drives the addict back again and again to the enslaving
substance is tecato gusano  which apparently connotes some kind of interior psychic worm that cannot be sated or killed 
that black and hispanic people can be as big or bigger racists than white people  and then can get even more hostile and
unpleasant when this realization seems to surprise you 
that it is possible  in sleep  for some roommates to secure a cigarette from their bedside pack  light it  smoke it down to the
quick  and then extinguish it in their bedside ashtray   without once waking up  and without setting anything on fire  you will be
informed that this skill is usually acquired in penal institutions  which will lower your inclination to complain about the practice 
or that even flents industrial strength expandable foam earplugs do not solve the problem of a snoring roommate if the roommate
in question is so huge and so adenoidal that the snores in question also produce subsonic vibrations that arpeggio up and down
your body and make your bunk jiggle like a motel bed you ve put a quarter in 
that females are capable of being just as vulgar about sexual and elim inatory functions as males  that over     of all
persons arrested for drug and alcohol related offenses report being sexually abused as children  with two thirds of the remaining
    reporting that they cannot remember their childhoods in sufficient detail to report one way or the other on abuse  that you
can weave hypnotic madame psychosis like harmonies around the minor d scream of a cheap vacuum cleaner  humming to
yourself as you vacuum  if that s your chore  that some people really do look like rodents  that some drug addicted prostitutes
have a harder time giving up prostitution than they have giving up drugs  with their explanation involving the two habits  very
different directions of currency flow  that there are just as many idioms for the female sex organ as there are for the male sexorgan 
that a little mentioned paradox of substance addiction is  that once you are sufficiently enslaved by a substance to need to
quit the substance in order to save your life  the enslaving substance has become so deeply important to you that you will all but
lose your mind when it is taken away from you  or that sometime after your substance of choice has just been taken away from
you in order to save your life  as you hunker down for required a m  and p m  prayers  you will find yourself beginning to pray to
be allowed literally to lose your mind  to be able to wrap your mind in an old newspaper or something and leave it in an alley to
shift for itself  without you 
that in metro boston the idiom of choice for the male sex organ is  unit  which is why ennet house residents are wryly
amused by e m p h  hospital s designations of its campus s buildings 
that certain persons simply will not like you no matter what you do  then that most nonaddicted adult civilians have already
absorbed and accepted this fact  often rather early on 
that no matter how smart you thought you were  you are actually way less smart than that 
that aa and na and ca s  god  does not apparently require that you believe in him her it before he she it will help
you      that  pace macho bullshit  public male weeping is not only plenty masculine but can actually feel good  reportedly  
that sharing means talking  and taking somebody s inventory means criticizing that person  plus many additional pieces of
recoveryspeak  that an important part of halfway house human immuno virus prevention is not leaving your razor or
toothbrush in communal bathrooms  that apparently a seasoned prostitute can  reportedly  apply a condom to a customer s unit so
deftly he doesn t even know it s on until he s history  so to speak 
that a double layered steel portable strongbox w  tri tumblered lock for your razor and toothbrush can be had for under
      u s         o n a n  via home net hardware  and that pat m  or the house manager will let you use the back office s old
tp to order one if you put up a sustained enough squawk 
that over     of persons with a substance addiction suffer from some other recognized form of psychiatric disorder  too 
that some male prostitutes become so accustomed to enemas that they cannot have valid bowel movements without them  that a
majority of ennet house residents have at least one tattoo  that the significance of this datum is unanalyzable  that the metro
boston street term for not having any money is  sporting lint  that what elsewhere s known as informing or squealing or narcing
or ratting or ratting out is on the streets of metro boston known as  eating cheese   presumably spun off from the associative
nexus of rat 
that nose   tongue   lip   and eyelid rings rarely require actual penetrative piercing  this is because of the wide variety of

 clip on rings available  that nipple rings do require piercing  and that clitoris  and glans rings are not things anyone thinks you
really want to know the facts about  that sleeping can be a form of emotional escape and can with sustained effort be abused  that
female chicanos are not called chicanas  that it costs      u s  to get a ma driver s license with your picture but not your name 
that purposeful sleep deprivation can also be an abusable escape  that gambling can be an abusable escape  too  and work 
shopping  and shoplifting  and sex  and abstention  and masturbation  and food  and exercise  and meditation prayer  and sitting so
close to ennet house s old d e c  tp cartridge viewer that the screen fills your whole vision and the screen s static charge tickles
your nose like a linty mitten     
that you do not have to like a person in order to learn from him her it  that loneliness is not a function of solitude  that it is
possible to get so angry you really do see everything red  what a  texas catheter  is  that some people really do steal   will steal
things that are yours  that a lot of u s  adults truly cannot read  not even a rom hypertext phonics thing with help functions for
every word  that cliquey alliance and exclusion and gossip can be forms of escape  that logical validity is not a guarantee of
truth  that evil people never believe they are evil  but rather that everyone else is evil  that it is possible to learn valuable things
from a stupid person  that it takes effort to pay attention to any one stimulus for more than a few seconds  that you can all of a
sudden out of nowhere want to get high with your substance so bad that you think you will surely die if you don t  and but can just
sit there with your hands writhing in your lap and face wet with craving  can want to get high but instead just sit there  wanting to
but not  if that makes sense  and if you can gut it out and not hit the substance during the craving the craving will eventually pass 
it will go away   at least for a while  that it is statistically easier for low iq people to kick an addiction than it is for high iq
people  that the metro boston street term for panhandling is  stemming  and that it is regarded by some as a craft or art  and that
professional stem artists actually have like little professional colloquia sometimes  little conventions  in parks or public transport
hubs  at night  where they get together and network and exchange feedback on trends and techniques and public relations  etc 
that it is possible to abuse otc cold and allergy remedies in an addictive manner  that nyquil is over    proof  that boring
activities become  perversely  much less boring if you concentrate intently on them  that if enough people in a silent room are
drinking coffee it is possible to make out the sound of steam coming off the coffee  that sometimes human beings have to just sit
in one place and  like  hurt  that you will become way less concerned with what other people think of you when you realize how
seldom they do  that there is such a thing as raw  unalloyed  agendaless kindness  that it is possible to fall asleep during an
anxiety attack 
that concentrating intently on anything is very hard work 
that addiction is either a disease or a mental illness or a spiritual condition  as in  poor of spirit   or an o c d  like disorder or
an affective or character disorder  and that over     of the veteran boston aas who want to convince you that it is a disease will
make you sit down and watch them write disease on a piece of paper and then divide and hyphenate the word so that it
becomes dis ease  then will stare at you as if expecting you to undergo some kind of blinding epiphanic realization  when really
 as g  day points tirelessly out to his counselors  changing disease to dis ease reduces a definition and explanation down to
a simple description of a feeling  and rather a whiny insipid one at that 
that most substance addicted people are also addicted to thinking  meaning they have a compulsive and unhealthy
relationship with their own thinking  that the cute boston aa term for addictive type thinking is  analysis paralysis  that cats
will in fact get violent diarrhea if you feed them milk  contrary to the popular image of cats and milk  that it is simply more
pleasant to be happy than to be pissed off  that     of compulsive thinkers  thinking is about themselves  that     of this selfdirected thinking consists of imagining and then getting ready for things that are going to happen to them  and then  weirdly  that
if they stop to think about it  that      of the things they spend     of their time and energy imagining and trying to prepare for
all the contingencies and consequences of are never good  then that this connects interestingly with the early sobriety urge to pray
for the literal loss of one s mind  in short that     of the head s thinking activity consists of trying to scare the everliving shit out
of itself  that it is possible to make rather tasty poached eggs in a microwave oven  that the metro street term for really quite
wonderful is  pisser  that everybody s sneeze sounds different  that some people s moms never taught them to cover up or turn
away when they sneeze  that no one who has been to prison is ever the same again  that you do not have to have sex with a
person to get crabs from them  that a clean room feels better to be in than a dirty room  that the people to be most frightened of
are the people who are the most frightened  that it takes great personal courage to let yourself appear weak  that you don t have
to hit somebody even if you really really want to  that no single  individual moment is in and of itself unendurable  that nobody
who s ever gotten sufficiently addictively enslaved by a substance to need to quit the substance and has successfully quit it for a
while and been straight and but then has for whatever reason gone back and picked up the substance again has ever reported being
glad that they did it  used the substance again and gotten re enslaved  not ever  that bit is a metro boston street term for a jail
sentence  as in  don g  was up in billerica on a six month bit   that it s impossible to kill fleas by hand  that it s possible to smoke
so many cigarettes that you get little white ulcerations on your tongue  that the effects of too many cups of coffee are in no way
pleasant or intoxicating 
that pretty much everybody masturbates  rather a lot  it turns out 
that the cliche  i don t know who i am  unfortunately turns out to be more than a cliche  that it costs      u s  to get a
passport in a phony name  that other people can often see things about you that you yourself cannot see  even if those people are
stupid  that you can obtain a major credit card with a phony name for       u s   but that no one will give you a straight answer
about whether this price includes a verifiable credit history and line of credit for when the cashier slides the phony card through
the register s little verification modem with all sorts of burly security guards standing around  that having a lot of money does not
immunize people from suffering or fear  that trying to dance sober is a whole different kettle of fish  that the term vig is street
argot for the bookmaker s commission on an illegal bet  usually      that s either subtracted from your winnings or added to your
debt  that certain sincerely devout and spiritually advanced people believe that the god of their understanding helps them find
parking places and gives them advice on mass  lottery numbers  that cockroaches can  up to a certain point  be lived with  that
 acceptance  is usually more a matter of fatigue than anything else  that different people have radically different ideas of basic
personal hygiene 
that  perversely  it is often more fun to want something than to have it 

 that if you do something nice for somebody in secret  anonymously  without letting the person you did it for know it was you
or anybody else know what it was you did or in any way or form trying to get credit for it  it s almost its own form of intoxicating
buzz 
that anonymous generosity  too  can be abused 
that having sex with someone you do not care for feels lonelier than not having sex in the first place  afterward 
that it is permissible to want 
that everybody is identical in their secret unspoken belief that way deep down they are different from everyone else  that
this isn t necessarily perverse 
that there might not be angels  but there are people who might as well be angels 
that god   unless you re charlton heston  or unhinged  or both   speaks and acts entirely through the vehicle of human
beings  if there is a god 
that god might regard the issue of whether you believe there s a god or not as fairly low on his her its list of things s he it s
interested in re you 
that the smell of athlete s foot is sick sweet v  the smell of podiatric dry rot is sick sour 
that a person   one with the disease  ease   will do things under the influence of substances that he simply would not
ever do sober  and that some consequences of these things cannot ever be erased or amended      felonies are an example of this 
as are tattoos  almost always gotten on impulse  tattoos are vividly  chillingly permanent  the shopworn  act in haste 
repent at leisure  would seem to have been almost custom designed for the case of tattoos  for a while  the new resident tiny
ewell got first keenly interested and then weirdly obsessed with people s tattoos  and he started going around to all the residents
and outside people who hung around ennet house to help keep straight  asking to check out their tattoos and wanting to hear
about the circumstances surrounding each tattoo  these little spasms of obsession   like first with the exact definition of
alcoholic  and then with morris h  s special tollhouse cookies until the pancreatitis flare  then with the exact kinds of corners
everybody made their bed up with   these were part of the way tiny e  temporarily lost his mind when his enslaving substance
was taken away  the tattoo thing started out with tiny s white collar amazement at just how many of the folks around ennet
house seemed to have tattoos  and the tattoos seemed like potent symbols of not only whatever they were pictures of but also of
the chilling irrevocability of intoxicated impulses 
because the whole thing about tattoos is that they re permanent  of course  irrevocable once gotten   which of course the
irrevocability of a tattoo is what jacks up the adrenaline of the intoxicated decision to sit down in the chair and actually get it  the
tattoo    but the chilling thing about the intoxication is that it seems to make you consider only the adrenaline of the moment
itself  not  in any depth  the irrevocability that produces the adrenaline  it s like the intoxication keeps your tattoo type class
person from being able to project his imagination past the adrenaline of the impulse and even consider the permanent
consequences that are producing the buzz of excitement 
tiny ewell ll put this same abstract but not very profound idea in a whole number of varied ways  over and over  obsessively
almost  and still fail to get any of the tattooed residents interested  although bruce green will listen politely  and the clinically
depressed kate gompert usually won t have the juice to get up and walk away when tiny starts in  which makes ewell seek her
out vis a vis tattoos  though she hasn t got a tattoo 
but they don t have any problem with showing tiny their tatts  the residents with tatts don t  unless they re female and the
thing is in some sort of area where there s a boundary issue 
as tiny ewell comes to see it  people with tattoos fall under two broad headings  first there are the younger scrofulous
boneheaded black t shirt and spiked bracelet types who do not have the sense to regret the impulsive permanency of their tatts 
and will show them off to you with the same fake quiet pride with which someone more of ewell s own social stratum would
show off their collection of dynastic crockery or fine sauvignon  then there are the more numerous  and older  second types 
who ll show you their tattoos with the sort of stoic regret  albeit tinged with a bit of self conscious pride about the stoicism  that a
purple hearted veteran displays toward his old wounds  scars  resident wade mcdade has complex nests of blue and red serpents
running down the insides of both his arms  and is required to wear long sleeved shirts every day to his menial job at store     even
though the store s heat always loses its mind in the early a m  and it s always wicked motherfucking hot in there  because the
store s pakistani manager believes his customers will not wish to purchase marlboro lights and mass  gig abucks lottery tickets
from someone with vascular colored snakes writhing all over his arms      mcdade also has a flaming skull on his left shoulderblade  doony glynn has the faint remains of a black dotted line tattooed all the way around his neck at about adam s apple
height  with instruction manual like directions for the removal of his head and maintenance of the disengaged head tattooed on his
scalp  from the days of his skinhead youth  which now the tattooed directions take patience and a comb and three of april
cortelyu s barrettes for tiny even to see 
actually  a couple weeks into the obsession ewell broadens his dermo taxonomy to include a third category  bikers  of whom
there are presently none in ennet house but plenty around the area s aa meetings  in beards and leather vests and apparently
having to meet some kind of weight requirement of at least     kilos  bikers is the metro boston street term for them  though they
seem to refer to themselves usually as scooter puppies  a term which  ewell finds out the hard way  non bikers are not invited to
use  these guys are veritable one man tattoo festivals  but when they show them to you they re disconcerting because they ll bare
their tatts with the complete absence of affect of somebody just showing you like a limb or a thumb  not quite sure why you want
to see or even what it is you re looking at 
a like n b  that ewell ends up inserting under the heading biker is that every professional tattooist everybody who can
remember getting their tattoos remembers getting them from was  from the sound of everybody s general descriptions  a biker 
w r t the stoic regret group within ennet house  it emerges that the male tattoos with women s names on them tend  in their
irrevocability  to be especially disastrous and regretful  given the extremely provisional nature of most addicts  relationships 
bruce green will have mildred bonk on his jilted right triceps forever  likewise the doris in red dripping gothic script
just below the left breast of emil minty  who yes apparently did love once  minty also has a palsied and amateur swastika with the
caption fuck nigers on a left biceps he is heartily encouraged to keep covered  as a resident  chandler foss has an undulating

 banner with a redly inscribed mary on one forearm  said banner now mangled and necrotic because foss  dumped and badly
coked out one night  tried to nullify the romantic connotations of the tatt by inscribing blessed virgin above the mary with
a razor blade and a red bic  with predictably ghastly results  real tattoo artists  ewell gets this on authority after a white flag
group meeting from a biker whose triceps  tattoo of a huge disembodied female breast being painfully squeezed by a disembodied
hand which is itself tattooed with a disembodied breast and hand communicates real tattoo credibility  as far as tiny s concerned 
real tatt artists are always highly trained professionals 
what s sad about the gorgeous violet arrow pierced heart with pamela incised in a circle around it on randy lenz s right
hip is that lenz has no memory either of the tattoo impulse and  procedure or of anybody named pamela  charlotte treat has a
small green dragon on her calf and another tattoo on a breast she s set a boundary about letting tiny see  hester thrale has an
amazingly detailed blue and green tattoo of the planet earth on her stomach  its poles abutting pubis and breasts  an equatorial
view of which cost tiny ewell two weeks of doing hester s weekly chore  overall searing regret honors probably go to jennifer
belbin  who has four uncoverable black teardrops descending from the corner of one eye  from one night of mescaline and
adrenalized grief  so that from more than two meters away she always looks like she has flies on her  randy lenz points out  the
new black girl didi n  has on the plane of her upper abdomen a tattered screaming skull  off the same stencil as mcdade s  but
w o the flames  that s creepy because it s just a tattered white outline  black people s tattoos are rare  and for reasons ewell regards
as fairly obvious they tend to be just white outlines 
ennet house alumnus and volunteer counselor calvin thrust is quietly rumored to have on the shaft of his formerly
professional porn cartridge performer s unit a tattoo that displays the magiscule initials ct when the unit is flaccid and the full
name calvin thrust when hyperemic  tiny ewell has soberly elected to let this go unsubstantiated  alumna and v c 
danielle steenbok once got the bright idea of having eyeliner colored tattoos put around both eyes so she d never again have to
apply eyeliner  not banking on the inevitable fade that over time s turned the tattoos a kind of nauseous dark green she now has to
constantly apply eyeliner to cover up  current female live in staffer johnette foltz has undergone two of the six painful
procedures required to have the snarling orange and blue tiger removed from her left forearm and so now has a snarling tiger
minus a head and one front leg  with the ablated parts looking like someone determined has been at her forearm with steel wool 
ewell decides this is what gives profundity to the tattoo impulse s profound irrevocability  having a tatt removed means just
exchanging one kind of disfigurement for another  there are tingly and diehl s identical palmate cannabis leaf on inner wrist
tattoos  though tingly and diehl are from opposite shores and never crossed paths before entering the house 
nell gunther refuses to discuss tattoos with tiny ewell in any way or form 
for a while  tiny ewell considers live in staffer don gately s homemade jailhouse tattoos too primitive to even bother asking
about 
he d made a true pest of himself  though  ewell did  when at the height of the obsession this one synthetic narc addicted kid
came in who refused to be called anything but his street name  skull  and lasted only like four days  but who d been a walking
exhibition of high regret ink   both arms tattooed with spiderwebs at the elbows  on his fishy white chest a naked lady with the
same kind of overlush measurements ewell remembered from the pinball machines of his watertown childhood  on skull s back a
half m  long skeleton in a black robe and cowl playing the violin in the wind on a crag with the dead in maroon on a vertical
gonfalonish banner unfurling below  on one biceps either an icepick or a mucronate dagger  and down both forearms a kind of st 
vitus s dance of leather winged dragons with the words  on both forearms  how do you lik your blueyed boy
now mr deth     the typos of which  tiny felt  only served to heighten skull s whole general tatt gestalt s intended effect 
which tiny presumed was primarily to repel 
in fact tiny e  s whole displacement of obsession from bunks  hospital corners to people s tattoos was probably courtesy of
this kid skull  who on his second night in the newer male residents  five man room had shed his electrified muscle shirt and was
showing off his tattoos in a boneheaded regretless first category fashion to ken erdedy while r  lenz did headstands against the
closet door in his jockstrap and ewell and geoffrey d  had their wallets  credit cards spread out on ewelps drum tight bunk and
were trying to settle a kind of admittedly childish argument about who had the more prestigious credit cards   skull flexing his
pectorals to make the overdeveloped woman on his chest writhe  reading his forearms to erdedy  etc    and geoffrey day had
looked up from his amex  gold  to ewelfs platinum  and shaken his moist pale head at ewell and asked rhetorically what had
ever happened to good old traditional u s  tattoos like mom or an anchor  which for some reason touched off a small obsessive
explosion in ewelps detox frazzled psyche 
probably the most poignant items in ewell s survey are the much faded tattoos of old boston aa guys who ve been sober in
the fellowship for decades  the crocodilic elder statesmen of the white flag and allston groups and the st  columbkill sunday
night group and ewell s chosen home group  wednesday night s better late than never group  nonsmoking  at st  elizabeth s
hospital just two blocks down from the house  there is something queerly poignant about a deeply faded tattoo  a poignancy
something along the lines of coming upon the tiny and poignantly unfashionable clothes of a child long since grown up in an attic
trunk somewhere  the clothes  not the grown child  ewell confirmed for g  day   see  e g   white flag s cantankerous old francis
  ferocious francis   gehaney s right forearm s tatt of a martini glass with a naked lady sitting in the glass with her legs kicking up
over the broad flaring rim  with an old style rita hayworth era bangs intensive hairstyle  faded to a kind of underwater blue  its
incidental black lines gone soot green and the red of the lips nails  subikbay   usn     not lightened to pink but more like
decayed to the dusty red of fire through much smoke  all these old sober boston blue collar men s irrevocable tattoos fading
almost observably under the low budget fluorescence of church basements and hospital auditoria   ewell watched and charted
and cross referenced them  moved  any number of good old u s n  anchors  and in irish boston sooty green shamrocks  and
several little frozen tableaux of little khaki figures in g i  helmets plunging bayonets into the stomachs of hideous urine yellow
bucktoothed oriental caricatures  and screaming eagles with their claws faded blunt  and semper fi  all autolyzed to the point
where the tattoos look like they re just under the surface of a murky type pond 
a tall silent hard looking old black haired bltn group veteran has the terse and hateful single word pussy in what s faded
to pond scum green down one liver spotted forearm  but yet the fellow transcends even stoic regret by dressing and carrying
himself as if the word simply wasn t there  or was so irrevocably there there was no point even thinking about it  there s a deep and

 tremendously compelling dignity about the old man s demeanor w r t the pussy on his arm  and ewell actually considers
approaching this fellow re the issue of sponsorship  if and when he feels it s appropriate to get an aa sponsor  if he decides it s
germane in his case 
near the conclusion of this two month obsession  tiny ewell approaches don gately on the subject of whether the jailhouse
tattoo should maybe comprise a whole separate phylum of tattoo  ewell s personal feeling is that jailhouse tattoos aren t poignant
so much as grotesque  that they seem like they weren t a matter of impulsive decoration or self presentation so much as simple
self mutilation arising out of boredom and general disregard for one s own body and the aesthetics of decoration  don gately s
developed the habit of staring coolly at ewell until the little attorney shuts up  though this is partly to disguise the fact that gately
usually can t follow what ewell s saying and is unsure whether this is because he s not smart or educated enough to understand
ewell or because ewell is simply out of his fucking mind 
don gately tells ewell how your basic type jailhouse tatt is homemade with sewing needles from the jailhouse canteen and
some blue ink from the cartridge of a fountain pen promoted from the breast pocket of an unalert public defender  is why the
jailhouse genre is always the same night sky blue  the needle is dipped in the ink and jabbed as deep into the tattooee as it can be
jabbed without making him recoil and fucking up your aim  just a plain ultraminimal blue square like gately s got on his right
wrist takes half a day and hundreds of individual jabs  how come the lines are never quite straight and the color s never quite all
the way solid is it s impossible to get all the individualized punctures down to the same uniform deepness in the  like  twitching
flesh  this is why jailhouse tatts always look like they were done by sadistic children on rainy afternoons  gately has a blue
square on his right wrist and a sloppy cross on the inside of his mammoth left forearm  he d done the square himself  and a
cellmate had done the cross in return for gately doing a cross on the cellmate  oral narcotics render the process both less painful
and less tedious  the sewing needle is sterilized in grain alcohol  which gately explains that the alcohol is got by taking mess hall
fruit and mashing it up and adding water and secreting the whole mess in a ziploc just inside the flush hole thing of the cell s
toilet  to  like  foment  the sterilizing results of this can be consumed  as well  bonded liquor and cocaine are the only things hard
to get inside of m d c  penal institutions  because the expense of them gets everybody all excited and it s only a matter of time
before somebody goes and eats cheese  the inexpensive c iv oral narcotic talwin can be traded for cigarettes  however  which
can in turn be got at the canteen or won at cribbage and dominoes  m d c  regs prohibit straight out cards  or got in mass
quantities off smaller inmates in return for protection from the romantic advances of larger inmates  gately is right handed and his
arms are roughly the size of tiny ewelps legs  his wrist s jailhouse square is canted and has sloppy extra blobs at three of the
corners  your average jailhouse tatt can t be removed even with laser surgery because it s incised so deep in  gately is polite about
tiny ewell s inquiries but not expansive  i e  tiny has to ask very specific questions about whatever he wishes to know and then
gets a short specific answer from gately to just that question  then gately stares at him  a habit ewell tends to complain about at
some length up in the five man room  his interest in tattoos seems to be regarded by gately not as invasive but as the temporary
obsession of a still quivering substanceless psyche that in a couple weeks will have forgot all about tattoos  an attitude ewell
finds condescending in the extremus  gately s attitude toward his own primitive tattoos is a second category attitude  with most of
the stoicism and acceptance of his tatt regret sincere  if only because these irrevocable emblems of jail are minor rung bells
compared to some of the fucked up and really irrevocable impulsive mistakes gately d made as an active drug addict and burglar 
not to mention their consequences  the mistakes   which gately s trying to accept he ll be paying off for a real long time 
michael pemulis has this habit of looking first to one side and then over to the other before he says anything  it s impossible
to tell whether this is unaffected or whether pemulis is emulating some film noir type character  it s worse when he s put away a
couple  drines  he and trevor axford and hal incandenza are in pemulis s room  with pemulis s roommates schacht and troeltsch
down at lunch  so they re alone  pemulis and axford and hal  stroking their chins  looking down at michael pemulis s yachting
cap on his bed  lying inside the overturned hat are a bunch of fair sized but bland looking tablets of the allegedly incredibly
potent dmz 
pemulis looks all around behind them in the empty room   this  incster  axhandle  is the incredibly potent dmz  the great
white shark of organo synthesized hallucinogens   the gargantuan feral infant of  
hal says  we get the picture  
 the yale u  of the ivy league of acid   says axford 
 your ultimate psychosensual distorter   pemulis sums up 
 think you mean psychosensory  unless i don t know the whole story here  
axford gives hal a narrow look  interrupting pemulis means having to watch him do the head thing all over again each time 
 hard to find  gentlemen  as in very hard to find  last lots came off the line in the early   s  these tablets here are artifacts 
certain amount of decay in potency probably inevitable  used in certain shady cia era military experiments  
axford nods down at the hat   mind control  
 more like getting the enemy to think their guns are hydrangea  the enemy s a blood relative  that sort of thing  who knows 
the accounts i ve been reading have been incoherent  gistless  experiments conducted  things got out of hand  let s just say
things got out of control  potency judged too incredible to proceed  subjects locked away in institutions and written off as
casualties of peace  formula shredded  research team scattered  reassigned  vague but i ve got to tell you pretty sobering rumors  
 these are from the early   s   axhandle says 
 see the little trademark on each one  with the guy in bell bottoms and long sideburns  
 is that what that is  
 unprecedentedly potent  this stuff  the swiss inventor they say was originally recommending lsd    as what to take to
come down off the stuff   pemulis takes one of the tablets and puts it in his palm and pokes at it with a callused finger   what we re
looking at  we re looking here at either a serious sudden injection of cash   
axford makes a shocked noise   you d actually try to peddle the incredibly potent dmz around this sorry place  
pemulis s snort sounds like the letter k   get a large economy size clue  axhandle  nobody here d have any clue what they d
even be dealing with  not to mention be willing to pay what they re worth  why  there are pharmaceutical museums  left wing
think tanks  new york designer drug consortiums i m sure d be dying to dissect these  decoct like  toss into the spectrometer and

 see what s what  
 that we could get bids from  you re saying   axford says  hal squeezes a ball  silently looking at the hat 
pemulis turns the tablet over   or certain very progressive and hip type nursing homes i know guys that know of  or down at
back bay at that yogurt place with that picture of those historical guys inc was saying at breakfast was up on the wall  
 ram das  william burroughs  
 or just down in harvard square at au bon pain where all those   s era guys in old wool ponchos play chess against those
little clocks they keep hitting  
axford s pretending to punch hal s arm in excitement 
pemulis says  or of course i m thinking i could just go the sheer entertainment route and toss them in the gatorade barrels at
the meet with port washington tuesday  or down at the whataburger   watch everybody run around clutching their heads or
whatever  i d be way into watching wayne play with distorted senses  
hal puts one foot up on pemulis s little frustum shaped bedside stool and leans farther in   would it be prying to ask how you
finally managed to get hold of these  
 it wouldn t be prying at all   pemulis says  removing from the yachting cap s lining every piece of contraband he s got and
spreading it out on the bed  sort of the way older people will array all their valuables in quiet moments  he has a small quantity of
personal consumption lamb s breath cannabis  bought back from hal out of a    g  he d sold hal  in a dusty baggie  a little
saran wrapped cardboard rectangle with four black stars spaced evenly across it  the odd  drine  and it looks like a baker s dozen
of the incredibly potent dmz  sweet tart sized tablets of no particular color with a tiny mod hipster in each center wishing the
viewer peace   we don t even know how many hits this is   he muses quietly  there s sun on the wall with the hanging viewer and
poster of the paranoid king and an enormous hand drawn sierpinski gasket  in one of the three big mullioned west windows   the
academy is nothing if not well fenestrated   there s an oval flaw that s casting a bubble of ale colored autumn sunlight from the
window s left side to elongate onto pemulis s tightly made bed      and he moves everything his hat s got into the brighter
bubble  going down on one knee to study a tablet between his forceps  pemulis owns stuff like philatelic forceps  a loupe  a
pharmaceutical scale  a postal scale  a personal size bun sen burner  with the calm precision of a jeweler   the literature s mute on
the titration  do you take one tablet   he looks up on one side and then back around on the other at the boys  faces leaning in
above   is like half a tab a regulation hit  
 two or even three tablets  maybe   hal says  knowing he sounds greedy but unable to help himself 
 the accessible data s vague   pemulis says  his profile contorted around the loupe in his socket   the literature on muscimolelysergic blends is spotty and vague and hard to read except to say how massively powerful the supposed yields are  
hal looks at the top of pemulis s head   did you hit a medical library  
 i got on med com off lateral alice s wats line and went back and forth and up and down through med com  plenty on
lysergics  plenty on methoxy class hybrids  vague and almost gossip columny shit on fitviavi compounds  to get anything you
got to cross key ergotics with the phrase muscimole or muscimolated  only a couple things ring the bell when you key in dmz 
then they re all potent this  sinister that  nothing with any specifics  and jumbly polysyllables out the ass  whole thing gave me a
migraine   
 yes but did you actually hop in the truck and actually go to a real med library   hal s his mother avril s child when it comes
to databases  software spell checks  etc  axford now really does punch him once in the shoulder  albeit the right one  pemulis is
scratching absently at the little hair hurricane at the center of his hair  it s close to    oh   and the flawed bubble of light on the
bed is getting to be the slightly sad color of early winter p m  there are still no sounds from the west courts outside  but there s
high song of much volume through the wall s water pipes   a lot of the guys who are drilled past caring in the a m  don t get it
up to shower until after lunch  then sit through p m  classes with wet hair and different clothes than their a m  classes 
pemulis rises to stand between them and looks around the empty three bedded room again  with neat stacks of three players 
clothes and bright gear on shelves and three wicker laundry hampers bulging slightly  there is the rich scent of athletic laundry 
but other than that the room looks almost professionally clean  pemulis and schacht s room makes hal and mario s room look like
an insane asylum  hal thinks  axford drew one of only two single upperclass rooms in last spring s lottery  the other having gone
to the vaught twins  who get counted as one entry in room draw 
pemulis still has his cheek screwed up to keep the loupe in as he looks around   one monograph had this toss off about dmz
where the guy invites you to envision acid that has itself dropped acid    holy crow  
 one article out of fucking moment of all sources talks about how this one army convict at leavenworth got allegedly
injected with some massive unspecified dose of early dmz as part of some army experiment in christ only knows what and
about how this convict s family sued over how the guy reportedly lost his mind   he directs the loupe dramatically at first hal and
then axford   i mean literally lost his mind  like the massive dose picked his mind up and carried it off somewhere and put it down
someplace and forgot where  
 i think we get the picture  mike  
 allegedly moment says how the guy s found later in his army cell  in some impossible lotus position  singing show tunes in
a scary deadly accurate ethel merman impression voice  
axford says maybe pemulis stumbled on a possible explanation for poor old lyle and his lotus position down in the weight
room  gesturing with the bad right hand in the direction of comm  ad 
again pemulis with the thing with the head  the slackening of a cheek lets the loupe fall out and bounce off the drum tight
bed  and pemulis gets it to rebound into his palm without even looking   i think we can err on the side of not dickying the
gatorade barrels  anyway  this soldier s story s moral was proceed with caution  big time  the guy s mind s still allegedly awol 
an old soldier  now  still belting out broadway medleys in some secretive institution someplace  blood relatives try to sue on the
guy s behalf  army apparently came up with enough arguments to give the jury reasonable doubt about if the guy can even be said
to legally exist enough to bring suit  anymore  since the dose misplaced his mind  
axford feels absently at his elbow   so you re saying let s proceed with care why don t we  
hal kneels to prod one of the tablets up against the dusty baggie s side  his finger looks dark in the elongated bubble of light 

 tm thinking these look like two tablets are possibly a hit  a kind of motrinish look to them  
 visual guesswork isn t going to do it  this is not bob hope  inc  
 we could even designate it  ethel   for on the phone   axford suggests 
pemulis watches hal arranging the tablets into the same general cardioid shape as e t a  itself   what i m saying  this is not
a fools rush in type substance  inc  this show tune soldier like left the planet  
 well  so long as he waves every so often  
 the sense i got is the only thing he waves at is his food  
 but that was from a massive early dose   axford says 
hal s arrangement of the tablets on the red and gray counterpane is almost zen in its precision   these are from the   s  
after intricate third party negotiations  michael pemulis finally landed     mg  of the vaunted and elusive compound dmz
or  madame psychosis  from a small arms draped duo of reputed former canadian insurgents who now undertook small and
probably kind of pathetic outdated insurgency projects from behind the front operation of a cut rate mirror  blown glass  practical
joke  n gag  trendy postcard  and low demand old film cartridge emporium called antitoi entertainment  just up prospect st  from
inman square in cambridge s decayed portugo brazilian district  because pemulis always conducts business solo and speaks no
french  the whole transaction with the nuck in charge had to be negotiated in dumbshow  and since this lumberjackish antitoi
nuckwad tended to look from side to side before he communicated even more than pemulis looked all around himself  with his
dim looking partner standing there cradling a broom and also scanning for eavesdroppers in the closed shop the whole time  the
whole negotiated deal had resembled a kind of group psychomotor seizure  with different bits of whipping and waggling heads
reflected in dislocated sections and at jagged angles in more mirrors and pebbled blown glass vases than pemulis had ever seen
crammed into anywhere  a very low rent tp indeed had a hardcore porn cartridge going at five times the normal speed so it
looked like crazed rodents and may have turned pemulis s sexual glands off for all time  he feels  god alone knew where these
clowns had acquired thirteen incredibly potent    mg  artifacts of the b s      s  but the good news is they were canadians  and
like fucking nucksters about almost anything they had no idea what what they were in possession of was worth  as it slowly
emerged  pemulis  w  aid of     mg  of time release tenuate dospan  almost danced a little post transaction jig on his way up the
steps of the otiose cambridge bus  feeling the way w  penn in his quaker oats hat in like the   th century must have felt trading a
few trinkets to babe in the woods natives for new jersey  he imagines  doffing the nautical cap to two nuns in the aisle 
over the course of the next academic day   the incredibly potent stash now wrapped tight in saran and stashed deep in the
toe of an old sneaker that sits atop the aluminum strut between two panels in subdorm b s drop ceiling  pemulis s time tested
entrepot   over the course of the next day or so the matter s hashed out and it s decided that while there s no real reason to involve
boone or stice or struck or troeltsch  it s really pemulis and axford and hal s right   duty  almost  to the spirits of inquiry and
good trade practice   to sample the potentially incredibly potent dmz in predeter minedly safe amounts before unleashing it on
boone or troeltsch or any unwitting civilians  axford having been allowed in on the front end  the question of hal s defraying the
opportunity cost of his part in the experiment is tactfully broached and turns out to be no problem  pemulis s mark up isn t
anything beyond accepted norms  and there s always room in hal s budget for spirited inquiry  hal s one condition is that
somebody tech literate actually take the truck down to b u  or m i t  s medical library and physically verify that the compound is
both organic and nonaddictive  which pemulis says a physical hands on library assault is already down in his day planner in pen 
anyway  after p m  drills on thursday  as hal incandenza and pemulis with camera mounted mario incandenza in tow stand with
their hands in the chainlink mesh of one of the show courts  fencing and watch teddy schacht play a private exhibition against a
syrian satellite pro who s at e t a  for two paid weeks of corrective instruction on a service motion that s eroding his rotator cuff
  the guy wears thick glasses with a black athletic band around his head and plays with an upright square jawed liquid precision
and is dispatching ted schacht handily  which schacht is taking with his customary sanguine good temper  giving his stolid all 
learning what he can  one of very few genuinely stocky players at e t a  and one of the even fewer ranked junior players around
without an apparent ego  wholly noninsecure since he blew out his knee on a contre pied in the pre thanksgiving exhibition three
years back  which is odd  now still in and at it for just the fun   and more or less doomed  therefore  to a purgatorial existence in
        alphabetville   as pemulis and hal stand there sweaty in full red and gray e t a  sweats on a raw      p m   the sweat
in their hair starting to accrete and freeze  mario s head bowed under the weight of the head mount rig and his hideously
arachnodactylic fingers whitening as the fence takes his forward weight  hal s posture subtly but warmly inclined ever so slightly
toward his tiny older brother  who resembles him the way creatures of the same order but not the same family might resemble
one another   as they stand watching and hashing matters out  hal and pemulis  there s the thud and sprong of an e w d 
transnational catapult off way below to their left and then the high keen sound of a waste displacement projectile the clouds are
too low to let them see the flight of   though a weirdly yellow sheep shaped cloud is visible somewhere up off past acton 
connecting the horizon s seam to some kind of coming storm front held off by the athscme fans along the lowell methuen
stretch of border  northwest  pemulis finally nixes the notion of performing the spirited controlled experiment here in enfield 
where axford has to be at the a squad s dawn drills every morning at       and also hal  unless he s slept over at hmh the night
before  with hmh just not being a good dmz dropping venue at all  pemulis  scanning up and down the length of the fence and
winking at mario  posits that a solid    hours of demand free time will be advisable for any interaction with the incredibly potent
you know whatski  that also lets out the inter academy thing with port washington tomorrow  for which charles tavis has
chartered two buses  because so many e t a  players are getting to go and do battle in this one   port washington academy is
gargantuan  the xerox inc  of north american tennis academies  with over     students and    courts  half of which they ll have
already put under warm inflatable testar cover as of like halloween  p w  s staff being less into the value of elemental suffering
than schtitt   co    so many that tavis will almost surely go ahead and bus them all back up from long island just as soon as
the post competition dance is over  rather than shell out for all those motel rooms without corporate support  this e t a  p w 
meet and buffet and dance are a private  inter academy tradition  an epic rivalry almost a decade old  plus pemulis says he ll need
a couple weeks of quality med library stacks tossing time to do the more exacting titration and side effects research hal agrees
the soldier s sobering story seems to dictate  so  they conclude  the window of opportunity looks to be            the weekend
right after the big end of fiscal year fundraising exhibition with the e t a  a   b squads in singles against  this year  quebec s

 notoriously hapless jr  davis and jr  wightman cup squads      invited down under very quiet low profile political conditions
via the good expatriate offices of avril incan denza to get vivisected by wayne and hal et al for the philanthropic amusement of
e t a  patrons and alums  then to dance the p m  away at a catered supper and alumni ball   the weekend right before
thanksgiving week and the whataburger invitational in sunny az  because this year in addition to friday       they also get
saturday       off  as in from both class and practice  because c t  and schtitt have arranged a special one match doubles
exhibition for the saturday a m  following the big meet  one between two female coaches of the quebecois wightmans and
e t a  s infamous vaught twins  caryn and sharyn vaught  seventeen  o n a n  s top ranked junior women s doubles team 
unbeaten in three years  an unbeatable duo  uncanny in their cooperation on the court  moving as one at all times  playing not just
as if but in fact because they shared a brain  or at least the psychomotor lobes of one  the twins siamese  fused at the left and right
temple  banned from singles by o n a n  regs  the broad shadow casting vaughts  flinty eyed tire executive s daughters out of
akron  using her their four legs to cover chilling amounts of court  plus to sweep the charleston competition at every postexhibition formal ball for the last five years running  tavis ll be on wayne to play some sort of exhibitory thing  too  though
asking wayne to publicly smear a second quebecer in two days might be a bit much  and but everyone who s anyone ll be down
at the lung  watching the vaughts vivisect some adult ranked nucks  plus maybe wayne      then the e t a s will get saturday
to rest and recharge before starting both the pre whataburger training week and the bell lap of prep for       s boards  meaning
late friday night sunday a m  will give pemulis  hal  and axford  and maybe struck if pemulis needs to let struck in  for help
with library tossing  enough time to psychospiritually rally from whatever meninges withering hangover the incredibly potent
dmz might involve      and axford in the sauna predicted it would be a witherer indeed  since even just lsd alone he observed
left you the next day not just sick or down but utterly empty  a shell  void inside  like your soul was a wrung out sponge  hal
wasn t sure he concurred  an alcohol hangover was definitely no frolic in the psychic glade  all thirsty and sick and your eyes
bulging and receding with your pulse  but after a night of involved hallucinogens hal said the dawn seemed to confer on his
psyche a kind of pale sweet aura  a luminescence      halation  axford observed 
pemulis appears to have left out of his calculations the fact that he ll get that saturday p m  off classes only if he makes the
travelling list for the tucson whataburger the following week  and that unlike hal and axford he s not a lock  pemulis s u s t a 
rank  excepting his halcyon thirteenth year in the year of the perdue wonderchicken  has never gotten higher than      and the
whataburger draws kids from all over o n a n  and even europe  the draw will have to be weak indeed for him to get even one
of the    qualifying round invitations  axford s on the fringes of the top     but he got to go last year at seventeen  so he s almost
got to get to go  and hal is looking at getting a third or maybe fourth seed in    s singles  he s definitely going  barring some
sort of cataclysmic ankle relapse against either port wash  or quebec  axford postulates that pemulis isn t miscalculating so much
as simply showing a slitty eyed confidence  which as far as his match play outlook is concerned would be unusual and rather a
fine thing   prorector aubrey delint says  publicly  that seeing m  pemulis in practice v  seeing m  pemulis in a real match that
means anything is like getting to know some girl through e mail as like e mail keyboard type penpals and really falling for her
and then finally meeting her in person and finding out she s got like just one enormous tit in the exact middle of her chest or
something like that     
mario will get to come along if avril can convince c t  to bring him along to get whataburger footage for this year s e t a

schacht and the glossy syrian are laughing together about something up at the net post  where they ve walked to gather gear
and various spare rotator cuff  and knee appliances after the syrian kind of cornily jumped the net and pumped schacht s hand

rings out at some broad mock supplicant s gesture schacht s just now made

you can be at certain parties and not really be there  you can hear how certain parties have their own implied ends embedded
in the choreography of the party itself  one of the saddest times joelle van dyne ever feels anywhere is that invisible pivot where
a party ends   even a bad party   that moment of unspoken accord when everyone starts collecting his lighter and date  jacket or
greatcoat  his one last beer hanging from the plastic rind s five rings  says certain perfunctory things to the hostess in a way that
acknowledges their perfunctoriness without seeming insincere  and leaves  usually shutting the door  when everybody s voices
recede down the hall  when the hostess turns back in from the closed door and sees the litter and the expanding white v of utter
silence in the party s wake 
joelle  at the end of her rope and preparing to hang from it  listening  is supported by a polished hardwood floor above both
river and bay s edge  perched uncomfortably in striated light in one of molly notkin s chairs molded in the likeness of great
filmmakers from the celluloid canon  seated between empty cukor and frightening murnau in melies s fiberglass lap  his trousers 
crease uncomfortable and his cummerbund m i t  crested  the lurid chairs  directors are larger than life  joelle s feet dangle well
off the floor  her squished hamstrings beginning to burn under a damp thick cotton brazilian skirt which is vivid  curled pale
purples and fresh red against a latin black that seems to glow above pale knees and white rayon kneesocks and feet in clogs that
are hanging half off  legs swinging like a child s  always feeling like a child in molly s chairs  conspicuously perched in the eye of
a bad party s somewhat forced feeling storm of wit and good cheer  sitting by herself under what used to be her window  the
daughter of a low ph chemist and homemaker from western kentucky  a lot of fun to be with  normally  if you can get over the
disconcerting veil 
among pernicious myths is the one where people always get very upbeat and generous and other directed right before they
eliminate their own map for keeps  the truth is that the hours before a suicide are usually an interval of enormous conceit and selfinvolvement 
there are decorative bars  slender and of black iron that pigeon droppings have made piebald  over the west windows to this
third floor cooperative apartment on the east cambridge fringes of the back bay  where near professor notkin is holding a party
to celebrate passing her orals in film   film cartridge theory  the doctoral program where joelle   before her retreat into

 broadcast sound   had met her 
molly notkin often confides on the phone to joelle van dyne about the one tormented love of notkin s life thus far  an
erotically circumscribed g  w  pabst scholar at new york university tortured by the neurotic conviction that there are only a
finite number of erections possible in the world at any one time and that his tumescence means e g  the detumescence of some
perhaps more deserving or tortured third world sorghum farmer or something  so that whenever he tumefies he ll suffer the same
order of guilt that your less eccentrically tortured ph d  type person will suffer at the idea of  say  wearing baby seal fur  molly
still takes the high speed rail down to visit him every couple weeks  to be there for him in case by some selfish mischance he
happens to harden  prompting in him black waves of self disgust and an extreme neediness for understanding and nonjudgmental
love  she and poor molly notkin are just the same  joelle reflects  seated alone  watching doctoral candidates taste wine   sisters 
sororal twins  with her fear of direct light  notkin  and the disguises and whiskers are simply veiled veils  how many sub rosa
twins are there  out there  really  what if heredity  instead of linear  is branching  what if it s not arousal that s so finitely
circumscribed  what if in fact there were ever only like two really distinct individual people walking around back there in
history s mist  that all difference descends from this difference  the whole and the partial  the damaged and the intact  the
deformed and the paralyzingly beautiful  the insane and the attendant  the hidden and the blindingly open  the performer and the
audience  no zen type one  always rather two  one upside down in a convex lens 
joelle is thinking about what she has in her purse  she sits alone in her linen veil and pretty skirt  obliquely looked at 
listening to bits of conversation she reels in out of the overall voices  noise but seeing no one really else  the absolute end of her
life and beauty running in a kind of stuttered old hand held   mm before her eyes  projected against the white screen on her side 
for once  from uncle bud and twirling to orin and jim and yyy  all the way up to today s wet walk here from the red line s
downtown stop  walking the whole way from east charles st   employing a self conscious and kind of formal stride  but
undeniably pretty  the overall walk toward her last hour was  on this last day before the great o n a n ite interdependence revel 
east charles to the back bay today is a route full of rained on sienna glazed streets and upscale businesses with awnings and
wooden signs hung with cute colonial script  and people looking at her like you look at the blind  naked gazes  not knowing she
could see everything at all times  she likes the wet walk for this  everything milky and halated through her veil s damp linen  the
brick sidewalks of charles st  unchipped and impersonally crowded  her legs on autopilot  she a perceptual engine  holding the
collar of her overcoat closed at her poncho s neckline in a way that lets her hold the veil secure against her face with a finger on
her chin  thinking always about what she has in her purse  stopping in at a discount tobacconist and buying a quality cigar in a
glass tube and then a block later placing the cigar inside carefully in among the overflowing waste atop a corner receptacle of
pine green mesh  but keeps the tube  puts the glass tube in her purse  can hear the rain s thup on tight umbrellas and hear it hiss in
the street  and can see droplets broken and regathering on her polyresin coat  cars sheening by with the special lonely sound of
cars in rain  wipers making black rainbows on taxis  shining windshields  in every alley are green i w d  dumpsters and the
smaller red i w d  dumpsters to take the overflow from the green dumpsters  and the sound of her wood sole clogs against the
receding staccato of brittle women s high heels on brick westward as charles st  now approaches boston common and becomes
less quaint and upscale  sodden litter   flat the way only wet litter can be flat   appears on the sidewalk and in the curb s seam 
and now murky colored people with sacks and grocery carts appraising that litter  squatting to lift and sift through litter  and the
rustle and jut of limbs from dumpsters being sifted by people who all day do nothing but sift through i w d  dumpsters  and other
people s blue shoeless limbs extending in coronal rays from refrigerator boxes in each block s three alleys  and the little cataract of
rainwater off the edge of each dumpster s red annex s downsloping side and hitting refrigerator boxes  tops with a rhythmless
thappathappappathap  somebody going pssssst from an alley s lip  and ghastly white or blotched faces declaiming to thin air from
recessed doorways curtained by rain  and for an other directed second joelle wishes she d hung on to the cigar  to give away  and
moving westward into the territory of the endless stem near the end of charles she starts to dispense change she is asked for from
doorways and inverted up tilted boxes  and she gets asked about the deal with the veil with a lack of delicacy she rather prefers  a
sooty wheelchaired man with a dead white face below a notre rai pays cap silently extends a hand for coins   a puffed red
cut across that businesslike palm is half healed and almost visibly closing  it looks like a dent in dough  joelle gives him a folded
u s  twenty and likes that he says nothing 
she buys a      liter pepsi cola in a blunt plastic bottle at a store    whose jordanian clerk just looks at her blankly when
she asks if they carry big red soda water  and settles for the pepsi and comes out and pours the pop out down a storm drain and
watches it pool there foaming brownly and stay put because the drain s grate is clogged solid with leaves and sodden litter  she
walks on toward the common with the empty bottle and glass tube in her purse  there was no need to buy chore boy pads at the
store    
joelle van dyne is excruciatingly alive and encaged  and in the director s lap can call up everything from all times  what will
be that most self involved of acts  self cancelling  to lock oneself in molly notkin s bedroom or bath and get so high that she s
going to fall down and stop breathing and turn blue and die  clutching her heart  no more back and forth  boston common is like
a lush hole boston s built itself around  a two k  square of shiny trees and dripping limbs and green benches over wet grass 
pigeons all over  the same sooty cream as the willows  rinds  three young black men perched like tough crows along a bench s
back approve her body and call her bitch with harmless affection and ask where s the wedding at  no more deciding to stop at
    h  and then barely getting through the hour s show and hurtling back home at  l  h  and smoking the chore boy s resins and
not stopping after all  no more throwing the material away and then half an hour later rooting through the trash  no more all fours
scrutiny of the carpet in hopes of a piece of lint that looks enough like the material to try to smoke  no more singeing the selvage
of veils  the common s south edge is boylston street with its      commerce  upscale  cashmere scarves and cellular holsters 
doormen with gold braid  jewelers with three names  women with valence curtain bangs  stores disgorging shoppers with their
wide white monogrammed twine handle bags  the rain s wet veil blurs things like jim had designed his neonatal lens to blur
things in imitation of a neonatal retina  everything recognizable and yet without outline  a blur that s more deforming than fuzzy 
no more clutching her heart on a nightly basis  what looks like the cage s exit is actually the bars of the cage  the afternoon s
meshes  the entrance says exit  there isn t an exit  the ultimate annular fusion  that of exhibit and its cage  jim s own cage iii 
free show  it is the cage that has entered her  somehow  the ingenuity of the whole thing is beyond her  the fun has long since

 dropped off the too much  she s lost the ability to lie to herself about being able to quit  or even about enjoying it  still  it no
longer delimits and fills the hole  it no longer delimits the hole  there s a certain smell to a rain wet veil  something about that
caller and the moon  saying the moon never looked away  revolving and yet not  she had hurtled on back home on the night s
final t and gone home and at least finally not turned her face away from the situation  the predicament that she didn t love it
anymore she hated it and wanted to stop and also couldn t stop or imagine stopping or living without it  she had in a way done as
they d made jim do near the end and admitted powerlessness over this cage  this unfree show  weeping  literally clutching her
heart  smoking first the chore boy scrap she d used to trap the vapors and form a smokable resin  then bits of the carpet and the
acetate panties she d filtered the solution through hours earlier  weeping and veilless and yarn haired  like some grotesque clown

she tries to  her clogs loose and clocking  tarrying for just a moment at the end  just past the gauntlet s end  still within two
extended hands  reach of the last bored dealer  for here on the street outside schwartz is placed an odd adverting display  not a live
salesman of any sort but rather a humanoid figure of something that s better than cardboard  untouched by the vendors who don t
seem even to look  a display on an angled rear mount stand like a photo frame s stand    d  the figure a man in a wheelchair  in a
coat and tie  his lap blanketed and no legs below  his well fed face artistically reddened with some terrible joy  his smile s arc of
the extreme curvature that exists between mirth and fury  his ecstasy terrible to see  his head hairless and plastic and cast back  his
eyes on the blue harlequin patches of the post storm sky  looking straight up  or having a seizure  or ecstatic  his arms also up and
out in a gesture of submission or triumph or thanks  his oddly thick right hand the receptacle for the black spine of the case of
some new film cartridge being advertised for distribution  the cartridge stuck like a tongue out of a slot in his  lineless  palm 
except there is only this display  this ecstatic figure and a cartridge no feral vendor s removed  no mention of title  no blurbs or
quoted references to critics  thumbs  the case s spine itself bare black slightly pebbled generic plastic  conspicuously unlabelled 
two oriental women s shopping bags catch and make her raincoat billow slightly as joelle stands there briefly  feeling the lines 
dealers looking at her  assessing  and then someone calls something to one of the cops halfway up the statue  using his first name 
which echoes slightly and breaks the spell  the little black boys look away  none of the passersby seem to notice the display she
stands before  reflecting  it s some kind of anti ad  to direct attention at what is not said  lead up to an inevitability you deny  not
new  but an expensive and affecting display  the film cartridge itself would be a blank  too  or the case empty  worthless because
it really can be removed all the way from the slot in the figure s hand  joelle removes it and looks at it and puts it back  she s had
her last fling with film cartridges  jim had used her several times  jim at the end had filmed her at prodigious and multilensed
length  and refused to share what he d made of it  and died w o a note      her mental name for the man had been  infinite jim  
the display cartridge shoves home with a click  one of the such young dealers calls her mama and asks where s the funeral at 
for a while  after the acid  after first orin left and then jim came and made her sit through that filmed apology scene and then
vanished and then came back but only to   only four years seven months six days past   to leave  for a while  after taking the
veil  for a while she liked to get really high and clean  joelle did  scrub sinks until they were mint white  dust the ceilings without
using any kind of ladder  vacuum like a fiend and put in a fresh vacuum bag after each room  imitate the wife and mother they
both declined to shoot  use incandenza s toothbrush on tiles  grout 
in places along boylston cars are triple parked  people s wipers are on that setting that joelle  who does not drive  imagines to
read occasional on the controls  her own personal daddy s old car had wipers  controls on the turr signal stalk by the wheel 
available yellow cabs pass  hissing in the streets  over half the passing cabs out here in the rain are advertising themselves as
available  purple numbers lit below taxi  as she remembers things jim was  besides a great filmic mind and her true heart s
friend  the world s best hailer of boston cabs  known to have less hailed than conjured cabs in spots where boston cabs by all

 that s right just aren t  a hailer of boston cabs in places like veedersburg  indiana and powell  wyoming  something in the
authority of the lifted arm s height  the oncoming taxi undergoing a sort of parallax as it bore down over tumbleweed streets  appearing under incandenza s upraised palm as if awaiting benediction  he was a tall and physically slow moving man with a great
love of taxis  and they loved him back  never again a cab in four plus years  after that  and so joelle van dyne  a k a  madame

hanging rain breaking into stutters and drips 
after she had smoked homemade freebase cocaine this a m  for the last time and then fired up the chore boys and good
panties she d used as a last filter and choked on burnt acetate when she shredded and smoked them  and had wept and imprecated
at the mirrors and thrown away her paraphernalia again for the final time  when an hour later she d walked not formally to her tstop under a parliament of gathering storm clouds and faint sticky bits of autumn thunder to ride to upper brighton and find lady
delphina  get real weight from lady delphina  so hard to just cut it off in mid binge  on a saturday  unless you just passed out  to
tell l d  when she d said goodbye and it was the last time it had been really the penultimate time but that this was the last time 
this was goodbye for real  and get serious weight from lady delphina  pay her twice the   gram rate as a generous farewell  as she
walked without much real formality to her t stop and stood on the platform  each time mistaking little mutters of thunder for the
approach of the train  wanting more of it so badly she could feel her brain heaving around in its skull  then a pleasant and gentlefaced older black man in raincoat and hat with a little flat black feather in the band and the sort of black frame styleless spectacles
pleasant older black men wear  with the weary but dignified mild comportment of the older black  waiting alone with her on the
chill dim davis square subway platform  this man had folded his herald neatly lengthwise and had it under the same arm he
tipped his hat with and said to excuse him if this was an intrusion  he said  but he d had occasion to see one or two of these linen
veils before  around  like what she wore  and was interested and rendered curious  he pronounced all four syllables of interested 
which joelle  from kentucky  enjoyed  if he might be so bold  he said  tipping his hat  joelle had engaged with him completely 
which was extremely rare  even off the air  she rather welcomed the chance to think about anything else at all  with the train

juice they d found they both liked so  and that joelle at home s abandoned and gone back to the big red soda water of childhood 
which notkin doesn t know  and still cluelessly considers extra sweet canadian juice to be pretty much both her and joelle s
biggest vices  molly notkin s the kind of soul you want desperately to be polite to but have to hide it with because she d be
mortified if she suspected you were ever just being polite to her about anything 
joelle makes a get out of here gesture   the really really good kind  
 the kind that looks muddy it s so fresh  
 where d you get it this late this far east  
 the kind you just about have to strain it s so fresh  
the living room is full and hot  campy mambo playing  walls still the same off white but all the trim now a confectioner s rich
brown  or plus there s wine  joelle sees  a whole assortment on the old sideboard it took three men with cigars in gray jumpsuits to
get up the stairs when they got it  an assortment of bottles of different shapes and dim colors and different levels of what s inside 
molly notkin has one dirty nailed hand on joelle s arm and one on the head of a chair of maya deren brooding avant gardedly in
vivid spun glass polymers  and is telling joelle about her orals in a party s near shout that will leave her hoarse well before this
big one s sad end 
a good muddy juice fills joelle s mouth with spit that s as good as the juice  and her linen veil is drying and beginning once
again comfortingly to flutter with her breath  and  perched alone and glanced at covertly by persons who don t know they know
her voice  she feels the desire to raise the veil before a mirror  to refine some of her purse s untouched material  raise the veil and
set free the encaged rapacious thing inside to breathe the only uncloth d gas it can stomach  she feels ghastly and sad  she looks
like death  her mascara s all over the place  no one can tell  the plastic pepsi bottle and glass cigar tube and lighter and packet of
glycine bags are a shape in the corner of the rain darkened cloth purse that rests on the floor just below her dangling clogs  molly
notkin is standing with rutherford keck and crosby baum and a radically bad postured man before the school supplied
infernatron viewer  baum s wide back and pompadour obscure whatever s on the screen  academics  voices sound nasal  with a
cultivated stutter at sentences  start  a good many of james o  incandenza s films were silent  he was a self acknowledged visual
filmmaker  his damaged grinning boy joelle never got to know because orin had disliked him often carried the case with the
lenses  grinning like somebody squinting into bright light  that insufferable child actor smothergill used to contort his face at the
boy and he d just laugh  which sent smothergill into tantrums that miriam prickett would resolve in the bathroom somehow  an
old latin revival cd issues at acceptable volume from the speakers screwed into planters and hung with thin chains from each
corner of the cream ceiling  another large loose group is dancing in the cleared space between the cluster of directorial chairs and
the bedroom door  most favoring y d a u  s minimal mambo  this autumn s east coast anticraze  the dancers appearing to be just
this side of standing still  the subtlest possible hints of fingers snapping under right angled elbows  orin incandenza  she has not
forgotten  had a poor mottled swollen elbow above a forearm the size of a leg of lamb  he had switched neatly from arm to leg 
joelle was orin incandenza s only lover for twenty six months and his father s optical beloved for twenty one  a foreign academic
with an almost franciscan bald spot has the swirling limp of someone with a prosthesis   hired by m i t  after her time  the
better dancers  movements are so tiny they are evocative and compel watching  their near static mass curdled and bent somehow
subtly around one beautiful young woman  quite beautiful  her back undulating minimally in a thin tight blue and white striped
sailorish top as she alludes to a cha cha with maracas empty of anything to rattle  watching herself almost dance in the full length
mirror of quality plate that after orin left joelle had forbidden jim to hang and had slid beneath her bed face down  now it s the
west wall s framed mirror  hung between two empty ornate gilt frames notkin thinks she s been retroironic by having the frames
themselves framed  in rather less ornate frames  in wry allusion to the early experialist fashion of making art out of the
accessories of artistic presentation  the framed frames hanging not quite evenly on either side of the mirror he d cut for the scenes
of that last ghastly thing he d made her stand before  reciting in the openly empty tones she d gone on to use on air  the girl stands
transfixed in alternating horizontal blue and white  then vertically sliced by bar cut sunlight  diced  drunk  so wrecked on good
vintage her lips hang slack and the reflected cheeks  muscles have lost all integrity and the cheeks jiggle like the outstanding paps
in her little sailor s top  apocalyptic rouge and a nose ring that s either electrified or is catching bits of light from the window  she
is watching herself with unselfconscious fascination in the only serviceable mirror here outside the bathroom  this absence of
shame at the self obsession  is she canadian  mirror cult  not possibly a u h i d   the bearing s all wrong  but now  whispered to
by a near motionless man in an equestrian helmet  she turns abruptly falling away from her own reflection to explain  not to the
man so much as no one in particular  the whole dancing mass  i was just looking at my tits she says looking down at herself aren t
they beautiful  and it s moving  there s something so heartbreakingly sincere in what she says joelle wants to go to her  tell her it is
and will be completely all right  she s pronounced beautiful like the earlier interested in four syllables  splitting the diphthong 
betraying her class and origin with the heartbreaking openness joelle s always viewed as either terribly stupid or terribly brave  the
girl raising her striped arms in triumph or artless thanks for being constructed this way  these  tits   built by whom and for whom
never occurring  artlessly ecstatic  she is not drunk joelle now sees but has taken ecstasy  joelle can see  from the febrile flush and
eyes jacked so wide you can make out brain meat behind the balls  poles  a k a  x or mdma  a beta something  an early synthetic 
emotional acid  the love drug so called  big among the artistic young under say bush and successors  since fallen into relative
disuse because its pulverizing hangover has been linked to the impulsive use of automatic weapons in public venues  a hangover
that makes a freebase hangover look like a day at the emotional beach  the difference between suicide and homicide consisting
perhaps only in where you think you discern the cage s door  would she kill somebody else to get out of the cage  was the
allegedly fatally entertaining and scopophiliac thing jim alleges he made out of her unveiled face here at the start of y t s d b  a
cage or really a door  had he even cut the tape into something coherent  there was nothing coherent in the mother deathcosmology and apologies she d repeated over and over  inclined over that auto wobbled lens propped up in the plaid sided pram 
he never let her see it  not even the dailies  he killed himself less than ninety days later  fewer than ninety days  how much must
a person want out  to put his head in a microwave oven  a dim woman all the kids had known of in boaz had put her cat in a
microwave to dry it after a tick bath and set the oven just on defrost and the cat ended up all over the woman s kitchen s walls 
how would you rig the thing so it would activate with the door open  is there just some sort of refrigerator light button you could

 hold down and secure with tape  would the tape melt  she cannot remember thinking of it once in four years  did she kill him 
somehow  just inclining veilless over that lens  the woman in love with her own breasts is being congratulated with the subtlest
possible allusions to clapping hands from barely animate dancers with their glass tulips held between their teeth  and vogelsong of
emerson college tries suddenly to stand on his head and is immediately ill in a spreading plum colored ectoplasm the dancers do
not even try to evade the spread of  and joelle applauds the xtatic woman as well  because they are  joelle admits freely  the paps 
they are attractive  which in the union is designated compelling within compatible relative limits  joelle has no problem seeing
beauty approved  within compatible relative limits  she feels not empathy or maternal nurture any longer  just a desire to swallow
every last drop of saliva she will ever manufacture and exit this vessel  have fifteen more minutes of too much fun  eliminate her
own map with the afflatus of the blind god of all doorless cages  and she lets herself slide forward from melies  lap  a tiny fall 
leading with her lumpy purse and glass of matte apple juice toward the door beyond the lines of a becalmed conga and door way d
huddles of a warm and well felt theoretical party  and then  again  delays  dithers  and the easement to the bathroom is blocked 
she is the only veiled woman here  and an academic generation ahead of most of these candidates  and rather feared  even though
not many know she is an aural personality  feared for quitting instead of failing  and because of the connection of the memory of
jim  and she is given a certain wide social berth  allowed to delay and orbit and stand unengaged at the fringes of shifting groups 
obliquely glanced at  veil going concave at each inbreath  waiting with hip shot nonchalance for the bathroom off the bedroom to
clear  lac carino the chaplin archivist and a jaundice yellow older man have gone into molly s bedroom and left the door ajar 
waiting nonchalantly  ignoring the foreign academic who wishes to know where she works with that veil  turning from him 
rudely  brain heaving in its bone box  memorizing every detail like collecting empty shells  sipping cloudy juice under neatly
lifted corners of veil  now looking at instead of through the translucent cloth  the improbably deformed s equivalent of closing the
eyes in concentration on sound  letting the very last party wash over her  passed gracefully by different mingling guests and once
or twice almost touched  seeing only inrushing and then billowing white  listening to different mingling voices the way the

the bathroom has a hook and a mirrored medicine cabinet over the sink and is off the bedroom  molly notkin s bedroom
looks like the bedroom of someone who stays in bed for serious lengths of time  a pair of pantyhose has been tossed onto a lamp 
there are not crumbs but whole portions of crackers protruding from the gray surf of wopsed up bedding  a photo of the
phalloneurotic new yorker with the same fold out triangular support as the blank cartridge s anti ad  a ziploc of pot and ezwiders and seeds in the ashtray  books with german and cyrillic titles lie open in spine cracking attitudes on the colorless rug 
joelle s never liked the fact that notkin s father s photograph is nailed at iconic height to the wall above the headboard  a systems
planner out of knoxville tn  his smile the smile of a man who wears white loafers and a squirting carnation  and why are
bathrooms always way brighter lit than whatever room they re off  on the private side of the bathroom door she s had to take two
damp towels off the top of to close all the way  the same rotten old hook for a lock never quite ever seeming to want to fit its
receptacle in the jamb  the party s music now some horrible collection of mollified rock classics with all soft rock s grim dental
associations  the business side of the door is hung with a selective automation of knoxville calendar from before subsidized
time and cut out photos of kinski as paganini and leaud as doinel and a borderless still of the crowd scene in what looks like
peterson s the lead shoes and rather curiously the offprinted page of j  van dyne  m a  s one and only published film theory
monograph      joelle can smell  through her veil and own stale exhalations  the little room s complicated spice of sandalwood
rubble in a little violet ribboned pomander and deodorant soap and the sharp decayed lemon odor of stress diarrhea  low budget
celluloid horror films created ambiguity and possible elision by putting   after the end  is what pops into her head  the end 
amid the odors of mildew and dicky academic digestion  joelle s mother s family had no indoor plumbing  it is all right  she
represses all bathetic this will be the last thing i smell thought patterns  joelle is going to have too much fun in here  it was
beyond all else so much fun  at the start  orin had neither disapproved nor partaken  his urine was an open book because of
football  jim hadn t disapproved so much as been vacant with disinterest  his too much was neat bourbon  and he had lived life to
the fullest  and then gone in for detoxification  again and again  this had been simply too much fun  at the start  so much better
even than nasaling the material up through rolled currency and waiting for the cold bitter drip at the back of your throat and
cleaning the newly spacious apartment to within an inch of its life while your mouth twitches and writhes unbidden beneath the
veil  the  base frees and condenses  compresses the whole experience to the implosion of one terrible shattering spike in the
graph  an afflated orgasm of the heart that makes her feel  truly  attractive  sheltered by limits  deveiled and loved  observed and
alone and sufficient and female  full  as if watched for an instant by god  she always sees  after inhaling  right at the apex  at the
graph s spike s tip  bernini s  ecstasy of st  teresa   behind glass  at the vittoria  for some reason  the saint recumbent  half supine 
her flowing stone robe lifted by the angel in whose other hand a bare arrow is raised for that best descent  the saint s legs frozen in
opening  the angel s expression not charity but the perfect vice of barb headed love  the stuff had been not just her encaging god
but her lover  too  fiendish  angelic  of rock  the toilet seat is up  she can hear a helicopter s chop somewhere overhead east  a
traffic helicopter over stor row  and molly notkin s shriek as an enormous glass crash sounds off in the living room  imagines her
beard hanging aslant and her mouth ellipsed with champagne s foam as she waves off the breakage that signals good party  can
hear through the door the ecstatic melinda s apologies and molly s laugh  which sounds like a shriek 
 oh everything falls off the wall sooner or later  
joelle has lifted her veil back to cover her skull like a bride  since she threw away her pipes and bowls and screens again this
a m  she is going to have to be resourceful  on the counter of an old sink the same not quite white as the floor and ceiling  the
wallpaper is a maddening uncountable pattern of roses twined in garlands on sticks  on the counter are an old splay bristled

 toothbrush  tube of gleem rolled neatly up from the bottom  unsavory old nocoat scraper  rubber cement  negram  depilatory
ointment  tube of monostat not squeezed from the bottom  phony beard whis kerbits and curled green threads of used mint floss
and parapectolin and a wholly unsqueezed tube of diaphragm foam and no makeup but serious styling gel in a big jar with no lid
and hairs around the rim and an empty tampon box half filled with nickels and pennies and rubber bands  and joelle sweeps an
arm across the counter and squunches everything over to the side under the small rod with a washcloth wrung viciously out and
dried in the tight spiral of a twisted cord  and if some items do totter and fall to the floor it is all right because everything
eventually has to fall  on the cleared counter goes joelle s misshapen purse  the absence of veil dulls the bathroom s smells 
somehow 
she s been resourceful before  but this is the most deliberate joelle has been able to be about it in something like a year  from
the purse she removes the plastic pepsi container  a box of wooden matches kept dry in a resealable baggie  two little thick glycine
bags each holding four grams of pharmaceutical grade cocaine  a single edge razor blade  increasingly tough to find   a little black
kodachrome canister whose gray lid she pops and discards to reveal baking soda sifted fine as talc  the empty glass cigar tube  a
folded square of reynolds wrap foil the size of a playing card  and an amputated length of the bottom of a quality wire coat
hanger  the overhead light casts shadows of her hands over what she needs  so she turns on the light over the medicine cabinet s
mirror as well  the light stutters and hums and bathes the counter with cold lithium free fluorescence  she undoes the four pins
and removes the veil from her head and places it on the counter with the rest of the material  lady delphina s little glycine baglets
have clever seals that are green when sealed and blue and yellow when not  she taps half a glycine s worth into the cigar tube and
adds half again as much baking soda  spilling some of the soda in a parenthesis of bright white on the counter  this is the most
deliberate she s been able to be in at least a year  she turns the sink s c knob and lets the water get really cold  then cranks the
volume back to a trickle and fills the rest of the tube to the top with water  she holds the tube up straight and gently taps on its
side with a blunt unpainted nail  watching the water slowly darken the powders beneath it  she produces a double rose of flame in
the mirror that illuminates the right side of her face as she holds the tube over the matches  flame and waits for the stuff to begin to
bubble  she uses two matches  twice  when the tube gets too hot to hold she takes and folds her veil and uses it as a kind of ovenmitt over the fingers of her left hand  careful  from habit and experience  not to let the bottom corners get close enough to the
flame to brown  after it s bubbled for just a second joelle shakes out the matches with a flourish and tosses them in the toilet to
hear that briefest of hisses  she takes up the black wire prod from the hanger and begins to stir and mash the just bubbled stuff in
the tube  feeling it thicken quickly and its resistance to the wire s tiny circles increase  it was when her hands started to tremble
during this part of the cooking procedure that she d first known she liked this more than anyone can like anything and still live 
she is not stupid  the charles rolling away far below the windowless bathroom is vividly blue  more mildly blue on top from the
fresh rainwater that had made purple rings appear and widen  a deeper magic marker type blue below the dilute layer  gulls
stamped to the cleared sky  motionless as kites  a bulky thump sounds from behind the large flat top enfield hill on the river s
south shore  a large but relatively shapeless projectile of drums wrapped in brown postal paper and belted with twine hurtling in a
broad upward arc that bothers the gulls into dips and wheels  the brown package quickly a pinpoint in the yet hazy sky to the
north  where a yellow brown cloud hangs just above the line between sky and terrain  its top slowly dispersing and opening out so
that the cloud looks like a not very pretty sort of wastebasket  waiting  inside  joelle hears only a bit of the bulky thump  which
could be anything  the only other thing besides what she s about to do too much of here right now she d ever come close to feeling
this way about  in joelle s childhood  paducah  not too bad a drive from shiny prize  still had a few public movie theaters  six and
eight separate auditoria clustered in single honeycombs at the edges of interstate malls  the theaters always ended in  plex  she
reflected  the thisoplex and thatoplex  it had never struck her as odd  and she never saw even one film there  as a girl  that she
didn t just about die with love for  it didn t matter what they were  she and her own personal daddy up in the front row  they sat in
the front rows of the narrow little overinsulated  plexes up in neck crick territory and let the screen fill their whole visual field  her
hand in his lap and their big box of crackerjacks in her hand and sodapops secure in little rings cut out of the plastic of their seats 
arms  and he  always with a wooden match in the corner of his mouth  pointing up into the rectangular world at this one or that
one  performers  giant flawless  d beauties iridescent on the screen  telling joelle over and over again how she was prettier than
this one or that one right there  standing in the placid line as he bought the  plex s paper tickets that looked like grocery receipts 
knowing that she was going to love the celluloid entertainment no matter what it was  wonderfully innocent  still thinking quality
referred to the living teddy bears in qantas commercials  standing hand held  eyes even with his wallet s back pocket bulge  she d
never so much again as in that line felt so taken care of  destined for big screen entertainment s unalloyed good fun  never once
again until starting in with this lover  cooking and smoking it  five years back  before incandenza s death  at the start  the punter
never made her feel quite so taken care of  never made her feel about to be entered by something that didn t know she was there
and yet was all about making her feel good anyway  coming in  entertainment is blind 
the improbable thing of the whole thing is that  when the soda and water and cocaine are mixed right and heated right and
stirred just right as the mix cools down  then when the stuff s too stiff to stir and is finally ready to come on out it comes out slick
as shit from a goat  just an inverted ketchup bottle thump and out the son of a fucking whore slides  one molded cylinder hardened
onto the black wire  its snout round from the glass tube s bottom  the average pre chopped freebase rock looks like a     round 
what joelle now slides with three fillips from the cigar tube is a monstrous white wiener  a county fair corn dog  its sides a bit
rough  like mache  a couple clots left on the inside of the tube that are what you forage and smoke before the chore boys and
panties 
she is now a little under two deliberate minutes from too much fun for anyone mortal to hope to endure  her unveiled face
in the dirty lit mirror is shocking in the intensity of its absorption  out in the bedroom doorway she can hear reeves mainwaring
telling some helium voiced girl that life is essentially one long search for an ashtray  too much fun  she uses the razor blade to
cross section chunks out of the freebase wiener  you can t whittle thin deli shaved flakes off because they ll crumble back to
powder right away and they anyway don t smoke as well as you d think  blunt chunks are s o p  joelle chops out enough chunks
for maybe twenty good sized hits  they form a little quarry on the soft cloth of her folded veil on the counter  her brazilian skirt
is no longer damp  reeves mainwaring s blond imperial often had little bits of food residue in it   the ecstasy of st  teresa  is on
perpetual display at the vittoria in rome and she never got to see it  she will never again say and lo and invite people to watch

 darkness dance on the face of the deep   the face of the deep  had been the title she d suggested for jim s unseen last cartridge 
which he d said would be too pretentious and then used that skull fragment out of the hamlet graveyard scene instead  which talk
about pretentious she d laughed  his frightened look when she d laughed is for the life of her the last facial expression memory she
can remember of the man  orin had referred to his father sometimes as himself and sometimes as the mad stork and once in a
slip as the sad stork  she lights one wooden match and blows it right out and touches the hot black head to the side of the plastic
pop bottle  it melts right through and makes a little hole  the helicopter was probably a traffic helicopter  somebody at their
academy had had some connection to some traffic helicopter that had had an accident  she can t for the life of her  no one out
there knows she is in here getting ready to have too much  she can hear molly notkin calling through rooms about has anyone
seen keck  in her first theory seminar reeves mainwaring had called one film  wretchedly ill conceived  and another  desperately
acquiescent  and molly notkin had pretended to have a coughing fit and had had a tennessee accent and that was how they met 
the reynolds wrap is to make a screen that will rest in the bottle s open top  a regular dope screen is the size of a thimble  its
sides spread like an opening bud  joelle uses the point of some curved nail scissors on the back of the toilet to poke tiny holes in
the rectangle of aluminum foil and shapes it into a shallow funnel large enough to siphon gasoline  narrowing its tip to fit in the
bottle s mouth  she now owns a pipe with a monster sized bowl and screen  now  and puts in enough chunklets to make five or six
hits at once  the little rocks lie there piled and yellow white  she puts her lips experimentally to the melted hole in the side of the
bottle and draws  then  very deliberately  lights another match and extinguishes it and makes the hole bigger  the idea that she ll
never see molly notkin or the cerebral union or her u h i d  support brothers and  sisters or the yyy engineer or uncle bud on
a roof or her stepmother in the locked ward or her poor personal daddy again is sentimental and banal  the idea of what she s
about in here contains all other ideas and makes them banal  her glass of juice is on the back of the toilet  half empty  the back of
the toilet is lightly sheened with condensation of unknown origin  these are facts  this room in this apartment is the sum of very
many specific facts and ideas  there is nothing more to it than that  deliberately setting about to make her heart explode has
assumed the status of just one of these facts  it was an idea but now is about to become a fact  the closer it comes to becoming
concrete the more abstract it seems  things get very abstract  the concrete room was the sum of abstract facts  are facts abstract 
or are they just abstract representations of concrete things  molly notkin s middle name is cantrell  joelle puts two more matches
together and prepares to strike them  breathing rapidly in and out like a diver preparing for a long descent 
 i say is someone in there   the voice is the young post new formalist from pittsburgh who affects continental and wears an
ascot that won t stay tight  with that hesitant knocking of when you know perfectly well someone s in there  the oathroom door

lacquer and porcelain  vomiting muddy juice and blue smoke and dots of mercuric red into the claw footed trough  and can hear
again and seems to see  against the fire of her closed lids  blood  bladed vessels aloft in the night to monitor flow  searchlit

the transparent phone sounded from somewhere under the hill of bedding     as hal was on the edge of the bed with one leg
up and his chin on its knee  clipping his nails into a wastebasket that sat several meters away in the middle of the room  it took
four rings to find the receiver in the bedding and pull the antenna out 
 mmmyellow  
 mr  incredenza  this is the enfield raw sewage commission  and quite frankly we ve had enough shit out of you  
 hello orin  
 how hangs it  kid  
 god  please no  please o   not more separatism questions  
 relax  never crossed my mind  social call  shoot the breeze  
 interesting you should call just now  because i m clipping my toenails into a wastebasket several meters away  
 jesus  you know how i hate the sound of nail clippers  
 except i m shooting seventy plus percent  the little fragments of clipping  it s uncanny  i keep wanting to go out in the hall
and get somebody in here to see it  but i don t want to break the spell  
 the fragile magic spell feel of those intervals where it feels you just can t miss  
 it s definitely one of those can t miss intervals  it s just like that magical feeling on those rare days out there playing  playing
out of your head  de lint calls it  loach calls it the zone  being in the zone  those days when you feel perfectly calibrated  
 coordinated as god  
 some groove in the shape of the air of the day guides everything down and in  
 when you feel like you couldn t miss if you tried to  
 i m so far away the wastebasket s mouth looks more like a slot than a circle  and yet in they go  ka ching ka ching  there
went another one  even the misses are near misses  caroms off the rim  
 i m sitting here with the leg in a whirlpool in the bathroom of a norwegian deep tissue therapist s ranch style house     
meters up in the superstition mountains  mesa scottsdale in flames far below  the bathroom s redwood panelled and overlooks a
precipice  the sunlight s the color of the bronze  
 but you never know when the magic will descend on you  you never know when the grooves will open up  and once the
magic descends you don t want to change even the smallest detail  you don t know what concordance of factors and variables
yields that calibrated can t miss feeling  and you don t want to soil the magic by trying to figure it out  but you don t want to
change your grip  your stick  your side of the court  your angle of incidence to the sun  your heart s in your throat every time you
change sides of the court  
 you start to get like a superstitious native  what s the word propitiate the divine spell  
t suddenly understand the gesundheit impulse  the salt over the shoulder and apotropaic barn signs  i m actually frightened to
switch feet right now  i m clipping off the tiniest aerodynamically viable clippings possible  to prolong the time on this foot  in
case the magic s a function of the foot  this isn t even the good foot  
 these can t miss intervals make superstitious natives out of us all  hal lie  the professional football player s maybe the worst
superstitious native of all the sports  that s why all the high tech padding and garish lycra and complex play terminology  the

 like self reassuring display of high tech  because the bug eyed native s lurking just under the surface  we know  the bug eyed
spear rattling grass skirted primitive  feeding virgins to pop ogatapec and afraid of planes  
 the new discursive o e d  says the ahts of vancouver used to cut virgins  throats and pour the blood very carefully into the
orifices of the embalmed bodies of their ancestors  
 i can hear those clippers  quit with the clippers a second  
 the phone s no longer wedged under my jaw  i can even do it one handed  holding the phone in one hand  but it s still the
same foot  
 you don t know from true bug eyed athletic superstition till you hit the pro ranks  hallie  when you hit the show is when
you ll understand primitive  winning streaks bring the native bubbling up to the surface  jock straps unwashed game after game
until they stand up by themselves in the overhead luggage compartments of planes  bizarrely ritualized dressing  eating  peeing  
 micturation  
 picture a     kilo interior lineman insisting on sitting down to pee  don t even ask what wives and girlfriends have to suffer
during a can t miss winning streak  
 i don t want to hear sexual stuff  
 then there are the players who write down exactly what they say to everybody before a game  so if it s a magical can t misstype game they can say exactly the same things to the same people in the same exact order before the next game  
 apparently the ahts tried to fill up ancestors  bodies completely with virgin blood to preserve the privacy of their own mental
states  the apposite aht dictum here being quote  the sated ghost cannot see secret things   the discursive o e d  postulates that
this is one of the earlier on record prophylactics against schizophrenia    hey hallie  
 after a burial  rural papineau region quebecers purportedly drill a small hole down from ground level all the way down
through the lid of the coffin  to let out the soul  if it wants out  
 hey hallie  i think i m being followed  
 this is the big moment  i ve totally exhausted the left foot finally and am switching to the right foot  this ll be the real test of
the fragility of the spell    i said i think i m being followed    some men are born to lead  o    i m serious  and here s the weird
part  
 here s the part that explains why you re sharing this with your estranged little brother instead of with anybody whose
credulity you d actually value  
 the weird part is i think i m being followed by     by handicapped people  
 two for three on the right foot  with one carom  jury s still out    quit with the clipping a second  i m not kidding  take the
other day  i strike up a conversation with a certain subject in line in the post office  i notice a guy in a wheelchair behind us  no
big deal  are you listening    what are you doing going to the post office  you hate snail mail  and you quit mailing the moms
the pseudo form replies two years ago  mario says  
 but so the conversation goes well and hits it off  seduction strategies    and    are employed  which i ll tell you about
sometime at length  the point is the subject and i walk out together hitting it off and there s another guy in a wheelchair whittling
in the shade of a shop awning just down the street  ok  still not necessarily any kind of deal  but now the subject and i drive to
her trailer park   
 phoenix has trailer parks  not those silverish metal trailers  
 so but we get out of the car  and across the park s lot here s yet another wheelchaired guy  trying to maneuver in the gravel
and not making a very good job of it  
 doesn t arizona have more than its share of the old and infirm  
 but none of these handicapped guys were old  and they were all awfully burly for guys in wheelchairs  and three in an
hour s kind of stretching it  i was thinking  
 i always picture you having your little trysts in more domestic suburban settings  or else tall motels with exotically shaped
beds  do women in metal trailers even have small children  
 this one had very sweet little twin girls who played very quietly with blocks without supervision the whole time  
 cockle warming  o  
 and but so the point is i decamp the trailer like x number of hours later  and the guy s still there  mired in gravel  and in the
distance i could swear he s got on some kind of domino mask  and now everywhere i go the last several days there seems to be a
statistically improbable number of wheel chaired figures around  lurking  somehow just a little too nonchalantly  
 very shy fans  possibly  some club of leg dysfunctional people all obsessed in that shy fan like way with one of the first
north american sports figures people think of in connection with the word leg  
 it s probably my imagination  a dead bird fell in my jacuzzi  
 but now let me ask you a couple questions  
 this all wasn t even why i originally called  
 but you brought up trailer parks and trailers  i need to confirm some suspicions   two points  right in there  ka ching  never
having been in a trailer  and even the discursive o e d  having pretty much of a lacuna where trailer park trailers are concerned  
 and this is the one supposedly nonbats family member i call  this is who i reach out to  
 it d be whom  i think  but this trailer  this lady you met s trailer  confirm or deny the following  its carpet was wall to wall
and extremely thin  a kind of burnt yellow or orange  
 yes  
 the living room or like den area contained some or all of the following  a black velvet painting featuring an animal  a
videophonic diorama on some sort of knickknack shelf  a needlepoint sampler with some kind of frothy biblical saw on it  at least
one piece of chintz furniture with protective doilies on the arms  a smoke b gone air filtration ashtray  the last couple years 
reader s digests neatly displayed in their own special inclined magazine rack  
 check on velvet painting of leopard  sampler sofa with doilies  ashtray  no reader s digests  this isn t especially funny 
hallie  the moms comes out in you in these odd little ways sometimes  

  last one  the trailer person s name  jean  may  nora  vera  nora jean or vera may  
     
 that was my question  
 i guess i ll have to get back to you on that  
 boy  you really put the small r in romance  don t you  
 but why i m calling  
 it s not clear whether the fragile can t miss magic s still in force on the right foot  i m seven for nine  but there s a whole
different feel of somehow deliberately trying to get them in  
 hallie  i ve got somebody from moment fucking magazine out here doing a quote soft profile  
 you ve got what  
 a human interest thing  on me as a human  moment doesn t do hard sports  this lady says  they re more people oriented 
human interest  it s for something called quote people right now  a section  
 moment s a supermarket checkout lane display magazine  it s in there with the rodneys and gum  lateral alice moore reads
it  it s all over c t  s waiting room  they did a thing on the little blind illinois kid thorp thought so well of  
 hal  
t think lateral alice spends a lot of time in grocery store checkout lanes  which if you think about it are almost the ideal
environment for her  
 hal  
      being that she can just locomote sideways right on through  
 hallie  this physically imposing moment girl s asking all these soft profilesque family background questions  
 she wants to know about himself  
 everybody  you  the mad stork  the moms  it s gradually emerging it s going to be some sort of memorial to the stork as
patriarch  everybody s talents and accomplishments profiled as some sort of refracted tribute to el storko s careers  
 he always did cast a long shadow  you said  
 of course and my first thought is to invite her to go piss up a string  but moment s been in touch with the team  the front
office s indicated a soft profile would be positive for the team  cardinal stadium isn t exactly groaning under the weight of all the
fannies  winning streak or no  i ve also thought of referring her to bain  let bain rant at her or send her letters just trying to unparse
for quotes d take her a month  
 her as in female  not your typical orin type subject  a hardened  fast lane  gum cracking  maybe even small childless
journalist type female  in from new youok on the red eye  plus you said imposing  
 not all that tough or hard  but physically imposing  large but not un erotic  a girl and a half in all directions  
 a girl to dominate the space of any trailer she lives in  
 enough with the trailerisms  
 the strained quality is me trying to speak and pick caromed toenail parings up off the floor at the same time  
 this girl s immune to most of your standard conversational distractions  
 you re afraid you re losing your touch  an immune girl and a half  
 i said distraction not seduction  
 you kind of wisely avoid any female who you suspect could beat you up if things came down to that  
 she s more imposing than like most of our starting backfield  but weirdly sexy  the linemen are gaga  the tackles keep
making all these cracks about does she maybe want to see their hard profile  
 let s hope her prose is better than whoever did that human interest thing on the blind kid last spring  have you bounced this
new fear of the handicapped off her  
 listen  you of all people should know i have zero intent of forthrightly answering any stained family linen type questions
from anybody  much less somebody who takes shorthand  physical charms or no  
 you and tennis  you and the saints  himself and tennis  the moms and quebec and royal victoria  the moms and
immigration  himself and annu lation  himself and lyle  himself and distilled spirits  himself killing himself  you and joelle 
himself and joelle  the moms and c t   you v  the moms  e t a   nonexistent films  et cetera  
 but you can see how it s all going to get me thinking  how to avoid being forthright about the stork material unless i know
what the really forthright answers would be  
 everybody said you d regret not coming to the funeral  but i don t think this is what they meant  
 for example the stork took himself down before c t  moved in upstairs at hmh  or after  
 this is you asking me  
 don t make this appalling for me  hal  
 i wouldn t dream of even trying  
     
 immediately before  two  three days before  c t  had had what s now delint s room  next to schtitt s  in comm  ad    and
dad knew they were          very close  i don t know  o    you don t know  
 mario might know  like to chew the fat with booboo on this  o     don t make this like this hallie  
 and dad       the mad stork put his head in the oven  
 the microwave  o  the rotisserie microwave over next to the fridge  on the freezer side  on the counter  under the cabinet
with the plates and bowls to the left of the fridge as you face the fridge  
 a microwave oven  
 that is a rog and wile  o  
 nobody ever said microwave  
 i think it came out generally at the funeral  
 i keep getting your point  if you re wondering  

      
 so where was he found  then  
    for    is what       
 it s not like this is all that   
 the microwave was in the kitchen i already explained  o  
 all right  
 all right  
 so ok now  who would you say speaks most about the guy  keeps his memory alive  verbally  the most now  you  c t   or
the moms  
t think it s a three way tie  
 so it s never mentioned  nobody talks about him  it s taboo  
 but you seem to be forgetting somebody  
 mario talks about him  about it  
 sometimes  
 to what and or who all this talking  
 to me  for one  i suppose  
 and so you do talk about it  but only to him  and only after he initiates it  
 orin i lied  i haven t even started on the right foot yet  i ve been too afraid to change my angle of approach to the nails  the
right foot s a whole different angle of approach  i m afraid the magic is left foot dependent  i m like your superstitious lineman 
talking about it s broken the spell  now i m self conscious and afraid  i ve been sitting here on the edge of the bed with my right
knee up under my chin  poised  studying the foot  frozen with aboriginal terror  and lying about it to my own brother  
 can i ask you who it was who found him  his   who found him at the oven  
 found by one harold james incandenza  thirteen going on really old  
 you were who found him  not the moms  
 listen  may i ask why this sudden interest after four years     days  and with two years of that not even once even calling  
 i ve already said i don t feel safe not answering helen s questions if i haven t got a handle on what i m not saying  
 helen  so you did  
 is why  
 i m still frozen  by the way  the self consciousness that kills the magic is getting worse and worse  this is why pemulis and
troeltsch always seem to let a lead slip away  the standard term is tightening up  the clippers are poised  blades on either side
of the nail  i just can t achieve the unconsciousness to actually clip  maybe it was cleaning up the few that missed  suddenly the
wastebasket seems small and far away  i ve lost the magic by talking about it instead of just giving in to it  launching the nail out
toward the wastebasket now seems like an exercise in telemachry  
 you mean telemetry  
 how embarrassing  when the skills go they go  
 listen
 you know  why don t you go ahead and ask me whatever standard ghoulish questions you want not to answer  this may be
your only shot  usually i seem not to talk about it  
 was she there  the p g o a t   
 joelle hadn t been around the grounds since you two split up  you knew about that  himself met her at the brownstone 
shooting  i m sure you know way more about whatever it was they were trying to make  joelle and himself  himself went
underground too  c t  was already doing most of the day to day administration  himself was down in that little post production
closet off the lab for like a solid month  mario d bring food and     essentials down  sometimes he d eat with lyle  i don t think he
came up to ground level for at least a month  except for just one trip out to belmont to mclean s for a two day purge and detox 
this was about a week after he came back  he d flown off somewhere for three days  for what the impression i get was workrelated business  film related  if lyle didn t go with him lyle went somewhere  because he wasn t in the weight room  i know
mario didn t go with him and didn t know what was up  mario doesn t lie  it was unclear whether he d finished whatever he was
editing  himself i mean  he stopped living on april first  if you weren t sure  was the day  i can tell you on april first he wasn t
back by the time p m  matches started  because i d been around the lab door right after lunch and he wasn t back  
 he went in for another detox you say  in what  march  
 the moms herself emerged and risked exterior transit and took him herself  so i gather it was urgent  
 he quit drinking in january  hal  it was something joelle was real specific about  she called even after we d agreed not to call
and told me about it even after i said i didn t want to hear about him if she was going to still be in his things  she said he hadn t
had a drop in weeks  it was her condition for letting him put her in what he was doing  she said he said he d do anything  
 well  i don t know what to tell you  by this time it was hard to tell whether he d been ingesting anything or not  apparently at
a certain point it stops making a difference  
 did he have film related things with him when he flew somewhere  a film case  equipment  
 o   i didn t see him leave and didn t see him come back  he wasn t around by match time  i know  freer beat me badly and
fast  it was   and      and    something  and we were the first ones done  i came around hmh to do an emergency load of laundry
before dinner  this was around       i came over and came in and noticed something right away  
 and found him  
 and went to get the moms  then changed my mind and went to get c t   then changed my mind and went to get lyle  but the
first authority figure i ran into was schtitt  who was irreproachably brisk and efficient and sensible about everything and turned
out to be just the authority figure to go get in the first place  
 i didn t even think a microwave oven would go on unless the door was closed  what with microwaves oscillating all over 
inside  i thought there was like a refrigerator light or read only tab like device  

  you seem to be forgetting the technical ingenuity of the person we re talking about  
 and you were totally shocked and traumatized  he was asphyxuated  irradiated  and or burnt  
 as we later reconstructed the scene  he d used a wide bit drill and small hacksaw to make a head sized hole in the oven door 
then when he d gotten his head in he d carefully packed the extra space around his neck with wadded up aluminum foil  
 sounds kind of ad hoc and jerry rigged and haphazard  
 everybody s a critic  this wasn t an aesthetic endeavor  
     
 and there was a large and half full bottle of wild turkey found on the counter not far away  with a large red decorative
giftwrappish bow on the neck  
 on the bottle s neck  you mean  
 that is a rog  
 as in he hadn t been sober after all  
 that would seem to follow  o  
 and he left no note or living will type video or communique of any kind  
 o  i know you know very well he didn t  you re now asking me stuff i know you know  besides criticizing him and making
sobriety claims when you weren t anywhere near the scene or the funeral  are we just about through here  i ve got a whole longnailed foot waiting for me here  
 as you reconstructed the scene  you just said  
 also it just hit me i ve got a library book i was supposed to return  i d forgotten all about it  kertwang  
   reconstructed the scene  as in the scene when you found him was somehow     deconstructed  
 you of all people  o  you know that was the one word he hated more than   
 so burned  then  just say it  he was really really badly burned  
     
 no  wait  asphyxuated  the packed foil was to preserve the vacuum in a space that got automatically evacuated as soon as
the magnitron started oscillating and generating the microwaves  
 magnitron  what do you know about magnitrons and oscillators  aren t you the brother of mine who has to be reminded
which way to turn the ignition key in a car  
 brief liaison with this one subject who used to model at kitchen appliance trade shows  
     
 it was kind of a brutal brand of modelling  she d stand there on a huge rotating lazy susan in a one piece with one thigh
turned in and a hand out palm up  indicating the appliance next to her  stood there smiling and spinning day after day  she d
stagger around half the evening trying to get her balance back  
 did this subject by any chance explain to you how microwaves actually cook things  
     
 or have you for example  say  ever like baked a potato in a microwave oven  did you know you have to cut the potato open
before you turn the oven on  do you know why that is  
 jesus  
 the b p d      field pathologist said the build up of internal pressures would have been almost instantaneous and equivalent
in kg s cm  to over two sticks of tnt  
 jesus christ  hallie  
 hence the need to reconstruct the scene  
 jesus  
 don t feel bad  there s no guarantee anybody would have told you even if you d popped in for  say  the memorial service  i
for one wasn t exactly a jabberjaw at the time  i seemed to have been evincing shock and trauma throughout the whole funeral
period  what i mostly recall is a great deal of quiet talk about my psychic well being  it got so i kind of enjoyed popping in and
out of rooms just to enjoy the quiet conversations stopping in mid clause  
 you must have been traumatized beyond fucking belief  
 your concern is much appreciated  believe me  
     
 trauma seems to have been the consensus  it turns out rusk and the moms had begun interviewing top flight trauma  and
grief counselors for me within hours after it happened  i was shunted directly into concentrated grief  and trauma therapy  four
days a week for over a month  right in the april may gearing up for summer tour period  i lost two spots on the    s ladder just
because of all the p m  matches i missed  i missed the hard court qualies and would have missed indianapolis if    if i hadn t
finally figured out the grief  and trauma therapy process  
 but it helped  ultimately  the grief therapy  
 the therapy ended up taking place in that professional building right up comm  ave  past the sunstrand plaza by lake
street  the one with bricks the color of thousand island dressing we all run by four days a week  who was to know one of the
continent s top grief men was right up the street  
 the moms didn t want the process going on too far from the old web  if need be  i m sure  
 this grief counselor insisted i call him by his first name  which i forget  a large red meaty character with eyebrows at a
demonic looking synclinal angle and very small nubbly gray teeth  and a mustache  he always had the remains of a sneeze in his
mustache  i got to know that mustache very well  his face had that same blood pressure flush c t  s face gets  and let s not even
go into the man s hands  
 the moms had rusk shunt you to a top grief pro so she wouldn t have to feel guilty about practically sawing the hole in the
microwave door herself  among other little guilt and antiguilt operations  she always did believe himself was doing more with
joelle than work  poor old himself never had eyes for anybody but the moms  

  this was one tough hombre  o   this grief counselor  he made a rusk session look like a day on the adriatic  he wouldn t let
up   how did it feel  how does it feel  how do you feel when i ask how it feels  
 rusk always reminded me of a freshman fumbling with some subject s bra  the way she d sort of tug and fumble at your
head  
 the man was unsatisfiable and scary  those eyebrows  that ham rind face  bland little eyes  he never once turned his face
away or looked away at anything but right at me  it was the most brutal six weeks of full bore professional conversation anybody
could imagine  
 with fucking c t  already moving his collection of platform shoes and unconvincing hairpieces and stairmaster in upstairs at
hmh already  
 the whole thing was nightmarish  i just could not figure out what the guy wanted  i went down and chewed through the
copley square library s grief section  not disk  the actual books  i read kubler ross  hinton  i slogged through kastenbaum and
kastenbaum  i read things like elizabeth harper neeld s seven choices  taking the steps to new life after losing someone you
love      which was     pages of sheer goo  i went in and presented with textbook perfect symptoms of denial  bargaining 
anger  still more denial  depression  i listed my seven textbook choices and vacillated plausibly between and among them  i
provided etymological data on the word acceptance all the way back to wyclif and   th century langue d oc french  the grieftherapist was having none of it  it was like one of those final exams in nightmares where you prepare immaculately and then you
get there and all the exam questions are in hindi  i even tried telling him himself was miserable and pancreatitic and out of his
tree half the time by then anyway  that he and the moms were basically estranged  that even work and wild turkey weren t
helping anymore  that he was despondent about something he was editing that turned out so bad he didn t want it released  that
the       that what happened was probably kind of a mercy  in the end  
 himself didn t suffer  then  in the microwave  
 the b p d  field pathologist who drew the chalk lines around himself s shoes on the floor said maybe ten seconds tops  he
said the pressure buildup would have been almost instantaneous  then he gestured at the kitchen walls  then he threw up  the
field pathologist  
 jesus christ  hallie  
 but the grief therapist was having none of it  the at least his suffering s over angle that kastenbaum and kastenbaum said is
basically a neon bright sign of real acceptance  this grief therapist hung on like a gila monster  i even tried telling him i really
didn t feel anything  
 which was a fiction  
 of course it was a fiction  what could i do  i was panic stricken  this guy was a nightmare  his face just hung there over his
desk like a hypertensive moon  never turning away  with this glistening mucoidal dew in his mustache  and don t even ask me
about his hands  he was my worst nightmare  talk about self consciousness and fear  here was a top rank authority figure and i
was failing to supply what he wanted  he made it manifestly clear i wasn t delivering the goods  i d never failed to deliver the
goods before  
 you were our designated deliverer  hallie  no question about it  
 and here but here was this authority figure with top credentials in frames over every square cm  of his walls who sat there
and refused even to define what the goods here would be  say what you will about schtitt and delint  they let you know what they
want in no uncertain terms  flottman  chawaf  prickett  nwangi  fentress  lingley  pettijohn  ogilvie  leith  even the moms in
her way  they tell you on the very first day of class what they want from you  but this son of a bee right here  no dice  
 you must have been in shock the whole time  too  
 o   it got worse and worse  i dropped weight  i couldn t sleep  this was when the nightmares started  i kept dreaming of a
face in the floor  i lost to freer again  then to coyle  i went three sets with troeltsch  i got b s on two different quizzes  i couldn t
concentrate on anything else  i d become obsessed with the fear that i was somehow going to flunk grief therapy  that this
professional was going to tell rusk and schtitt and c t  and the moms that i couldn t deliver the goods 
 i m sorry i couldn t be there  
 the odd thing was that the more obsessed i got  the worse i played and slept  the happier everybody got  the grief therapist
complimented me on how haggard i was looking  rusk told delint the grief therapist d told the moms that it was starting to work 
that i was starting to grieve  but that it was a long process  
 long and costly  
 roger  i began to despair  i began to foresee somehow getting left back in grief therapy  never delivering the goods and it
never ending  having these kafkaesque interfaces with this man day after day  week after week  it was now may  the continental
clays i d gotten all the way to the fourth round of the year before were coming up  and it became quietly clear that everybody felt
i was at a crucial stage in the long costly grieving process and i wasn t going to get to go with the contingent to indianapolis
unless i could figure out some last ditch way to deliver the emotional goods to this guy  i was totally desperate  a wreck  
 so you schlepped on down to the weight room  you and the forehead paid a visit to good old lyle  
 lyle turned out to be the key  he was down there reading leaves of grass  he was going through a whitman period  part of
grieving for himself  he said  i d never gone to lyle before in any kind of supplicatory capacity  but he said he took one griefstricken look at me flailing away down there working up a gourmet sweat and said he felt so moved by my additional suffering on
top of having had to be the first of himself s loved ones to experience the loss of himself that he d bend every cerebral effort  i assumed the position and let him at the old forehead and explained what had been happening and that if i couldn t figure out some
way to satisfy this grief pro i was going to end up in a soft quiet room somewhere  lyle s key insight was that i d been
approaching the issue from the wrong side  i d gone to the library and acted like a student of grief  what i needed to chew through
was the section for grief professionals themselves  i needed to prepare from the grief pro s own perspective  how could i know
what a professional wanted unless i knew what he was professionally required to want  etc  it was simple  he said  i needed to
empathize with the grief therapist  lyle said  if i wanted to spread a broader breast than his own  it was such a simple obversion of
my normal goods delivery preparation system that it hadn t once occurred to me  lyle explained  

  lyle said all that  that doesn t sound like lyle  
 but a sort of soft light broke inside me for the first time in weeks  i called a cab  still in my towel  i jumped in the cab before
it had even stopped at the gate  i actually said   the nearest library with a cutting edge professional grief  and trauma therapy
section  and step on it   et cetera et cetera  
 the lyle my class knew wasn t a how to deliver the goods to authorities type figure  
 by the time i hit the grief therapist s the next day i was a different man  immaculately prepared  unfazable  everything i d
come to dread about the man   the eyebrows  the multicultural music in the waiting room  the implacable stare  the crusty
mustache  the little gray teeth  even the hands   did i mention that this grief therapist hid his hands under his desk at all times  
 but you got through it  you grieved to everybody s satisfaction  you re saying  
 what i did    went in there and presented with anger at the grief therapist  i accused the grief therapist of actually inhibiting
my attempt to process my grief  by refusing to validate my absence of feelings  i told him i d told him the truth already  i used foul
language and slang  i said i didn t give a damn if he was an abundantly credentialed authority figure or not  i called him a
shithead  i asked him what the cock shitting fuck he wanted from me  my overall demeanor was paroxysmic  i told him i d told
him that i didn t feel anything  which was the truth  i said it seemed like he wanted me to feel toxically guilty for not feeling
anything  notice i was subtly inserting certain loaded professional grief therapy terms like validate  process as a transitive verb 
and toxic guilt  these were library derived  
 the whole difference was this time you were walking on court oriented  with a sense of where the lines were  schtitt would
say  
 the grief therapist encouraged me to go with my paroxysmic feelings  to name and honor my rage  he got more and more
pleased and excited as i angrily told him i flat out refused to feel iota one of guilt of any kind  i said what  i was supposed to have
lost even more quickly to freer  so i could have come around hmh in time to stop himself  it wasn t my fault  i said  it was not
my fault i found him  i shouted  i was down to black street socks  i had legitimate emergency grade laundry to do  by this time i
was pounding myself on the breastbone with rage as i said that it just by god was not my fault that   
that what  
 that s just what the grief therapist said  the professional literature had a whole bold font section on abrupt pauses in highaffect speech  the grief therapist was now leaning way forward at the waist  his lips were wet  i was in the zone 
therapeutically speaking  i felt on top of things for the first time in a long time  i broke eye contact with him  that i d been
hungry  i muttered  
 come again  
 that s just what he said  the grief therapist  i muttered that it was nothing  just that it damn sure wasn t my fault that i had the
reaction i did when i came through the front door of hmh  before i came into the kitchen to get to the basement stairs and found
himself with his head in what was left of the microwave  when i first came in and was still in the foyer trying to get my shoes off
without putting the dirty laundry bag down on the white carpet and hopping around and couldn t be expected to have any idea
what had happened  i said nobody can choose or have any control over their first unconscious thoughts or reactions when they
come into a house  i said it wasn t my fault that my first unconscious thought turned out to be   
 jesus  kid  what  
   that something smelled delicious   i screamed  the force of my shriek almost sent the grief therapist over backwards in his
leather chair  a couple credentials fell off the wall  i bent over in my own nonleather chair as if for a crash landing  i put a hand to
each temple and rocked back in forth in the chair  weeping  it came out between sobs and screams  that it d been four hours plus
since lunchtime and i d worked hard and played hard and i was starved  that the saliva had started the minute i came through the
door  that golly something smells delicious was my first reaction  
 but you forgave yourself  
 i absolved myself with seven minutes left in the session right there in full approving view of the grief therapist  he was
ecstatic  by the end i swear his side of the desk was half a meter off the floor  at my grief therapist textbook breakdown into
genuine affect and trauma and guilt and textbook earsplit ting grief  then absolution  
 christ on a jet ski  hallie  
     
 but you got through it  you really did grieve  and you can tell me what it was like  so i can say something generic but
convincing about loss and grief for helen for moment  
 but i d omitted that somehow the single most nightmarishly compelling thing about this top grief therapist was that his hands
were never visible  the dreadfulness of the whole six weeks somehow coalesced around the issue of the guy s hands  his hands
never emerged from underneath his desk  it was as if his arms terminated at the elbow  besides mustache material analysis  i also
spent large blocks of each hour trying to imagine the configurations and activities of those hands under there  
 hallie  let me just ask and then i ll never bring it back up again  you implied before that what was especially traumatic was
that himself s head had popped like an uncut spud  
 then on what turned out to be the last day of the therapy  the last day before the a squads were picked for indianapolis  after
i d finally delivered the goods and my traumatic grief was professionally pronounced uncovered and countenanced and processed 
when i put on my sweatshirt and got set to take my leave  and came up to the desk and put out my hand in a trembly grateful way
he couldn t possibly have refused  and he stood and brought out the hand and shook my hand  i finally understood  
 his hands were disfigured or something  
 his hands were no bigger than a four year old girl s  it was surreal  this massive authoritative figure  with a huge red meaty
face and thick walrus mustache and dewlaps and a neck that spilled over the rim of his shirt collar  and his hands were tiny and
pink and hairless and butt soft  delicate as shells  the hands were the capper  i barely made it out of the office before it started  
 the cathartic post traumatic like reexperience hysteria  you reeled out of there  
 i barely made it to the men s room down the hall  i was laughing so hysterically i was afraid all the periodontists and c p a s
on either side of the men s room would hear  i sat in a stall with my hands over my mouth  stamping my feet and beating my head

 against first one side of the stall and then the other in hysterical mirth  if you could have seen those hands  
 but you got through it all  and you can thumbnail sketch the overall feeling for me  
 what i feel is myself gathering my resources for the right foot  finally  that magic feeling s back  i m not lining up the
vectors for the wastebasket or anything  i m not even thinking  i m trusting the feeling  it s like that celluloid moment when luke
removes his high tech targeting helmet  
 what helmet  
 you know  of course  that human nails are the vestiges of talons and horns  that they re atavistic  like coccyges and hair 
that they develop in utero long before the cerebral cortex  
 what s the matter  
 that at some point in the first trimester we lose our gills but are now still now little more than a bladdery sac of spinal fluid
and a rudimentary tail and hair follicles and little microchips of vestigial talon and horn  
ts this to make me feel bad  did this fuck you up  me probing for details after all this time  did it reactivate the grief  
 just one more confirmation  the trailer s interior  there was some object or contiguous trio of objects with the following
color scheme  brown  lavender  and either mint green or jonquil yellow  
 i can call back when you re more yourself  the leg s starting to prune a bit from the whirlpool anyway  
til be right here  i ve got a whole foot to yield to the magic with  i m not going to alter the smallest particular  i m just about
ready to bear down on the clippers  it s going to feel right  i know  
 a throw  like an afghan throw  on the chintz sofa  the yellow was more fluorescent than jonquil  
 and the word is asphyxiated  kick some egg shaped balls for all of us  o  the next sound you hear will be unpleasant   hal
said  holding the phone down right next to the foot  his expression terrifically intense 

  november year of the depend adult undergarment
white halogen off the green of the composite surface  the light out on the indoor courts at the port washington tennis
academy is the color of sour apples  to the spectators at the gallery s glass  the duos of players arrayed and moving down below
have a reptilian tinge to their skin  a kind of seasick type pallor  this annual meet is mammoth  both academies  a and b teams
for both boys and girls  both singles and doubles  in    and unders     and unders     and unders  thirty six courts stretch out
down away from one end s gallery under a fancy tri domed system of permanent all weather lung 
a jr  tennis team has six people on it  with the highest ranked playing     singles against the other team s best guy  the nexthighest ranked playing     and on down the line to     after the six singles matches there are three doubles  with a team s best two
singles players usually turning around and also playing  l doubles   with occasional exceptions  e g  the vaught twins  or the fact
that schacht and troeltsch  way down on the b squad in    s singles  play    doubles on e t a  s    s a team  because they ve
been a doubles team since they were incontinent toddlers back in philly  and they re so experienced and smooth together they can
wipe surfaces with the    s a team s    and    singles guys  coyle and axford  who prefer to skip doubles altogether  it all tends
to get complicated  and probably not all that interesting   unless you play 
but so a normal meet between two junior teams is the best out of nine matches  whereas this mammoth annual earlynovember thing between e t a  and p w t a  will try to be the best out of      a    match all conclusion is extremely unlikely
  odds being   in       and has never happened in nine years  the meet s always down on long island because p w t a  has
indoor courts out the bazoo  each year the academy that loses the meet has to get up on tables at the buffet supper afterward and
sing a really silly song  an even more embarrassing transaction is supposed to take place in private between the two schools 
headmasters  but nobody knows quite what  last year enfield lost       and charles tavis didn t say one word on the bus ride
home and used the lavatory several times 
but last year e t a  didn t have john wayne  and last year h  j  incan denza hadn t yet exploded  competitively  john wayne 
formerly of mont cerf  quebec   an asbestos mining town ten clicks or so from the infamously rupture prone mercier dam  
formerly the top ranked junior male in canada at sixteen as well as    overall in the organization of north american nations
tennis association computerized rankings  was finally successfully recruited by gerhardt schtitt and aubrey delint last spring
via the argument that two gratis years at an american academy would maybe let wayne bypass the usual couple seasons of top
college tennis and go pro immediately at nineteen with more than enough competitive tempering  this reasoning was not unsound 
since the top four u s  tennis academies  tournament schedules closely resemble the a t p  tour in terms of numbing travel and
continual stress  john wayne is currently ranked    in the o n a n t a  s boys     s and    in the u s t a   canada  under
provincial pressure  has disowned him as an emigrant  and has in this year of the depend adult undergarment reached the semis
of both the junior french and junior u s  opens  and has lost to exactly nobody american in seven meets and a dozen major
tournaments  he trails the  l american kid  an independent     down in florida  veach  by only a couple u s t a  computer
points  and they haven t yet met in sanctioned play this year  and the kid is well known to be hiding out from wayne  avoiding
him  staying down in pompano beach  allegedly nursing a like four month groin pull  sitting on his ranking  he s supposed to
show at the whataburger invitational in az in a couple weeks  this veach  having won the    s at age seventeen there last year 
but he s got to know wayne s coming down  and speculation is rife and complex  o n a n t a  wise  there s an argentine kid that
mexico s academia de vera cruz has got rat holed away who s    and not about to lose to anybody  having this year taken three
out of four legs of the junior grand slam  the first time anybody s done that since a sepulchral czech kid named lendl  who
retired from the show and suicided well before the advent of subsidized time  but so there s wayne at  l 
and it s been established that hal incandenza  last year a respectable but by no means to write home about   rd nationally
and bouncing between    and    on the academy s a team in boys     s singles  has made a kind of quantumish competitive
plateaux hop such that this year   the one nearly done  kimberly clark corp  s depend absorbent products division soon to
give way to the highest corporate bidder for rights to the new year   incandenza  mind you this year just seventeen  is  th in the
nation and    on the o n a n t a  computer and playing a    for e t a  in boys     s  these competitive explosions happen
sometimes  nobody at the academy talks to hal much about the explosion  sort of the way you avoid a pitcher who s got a no 

 hitter going  hal s delicate and spinny  rather cerebral game hasn t altered  but this year it seems to have grown a beak  no longer
fragile or abstracted looking on court  he seems now almost to hit the corners without thinking about it  his unforced error stats
look like a decimal error 
hal s game involves attrition  he ll probe  pecking  until some angle opens up  until then he ll probe  he d rather run his man
ragged  wear him down  three different opponents this past summer had to go to oxygen during breaks      his serve yanks
across at people as if on a hidden diagonal string  his serve  now  suddenly  after four summers of thousand a day serves to no
one at dawn  is suddenly supposed to be one of the best left handed kick serves the junior circuit has ever seen  schtitt calls hal
incandenza his  revenant   now  and sometimes points his pointer at him in an affectionate way from his observation crow s nest in
the transom  during drills 
most of the singles  a matches are under way  coyle and his man on   are in an endless butterfly shaped rally  hal s muscular
but unquick opponent is bent over trying to get his breath while hal stands there and futzes with his strings  tall paul shaw on  
bounces the ball eight times before he serves  never seven or nine 
and john wayne s without question the best male player to appear at enfield academy in several years  he d been spotted
first by the late dr  james incandenza at age six  eleven summers back  when incandenza was doing an early and coldly
conceptual super   on people named john wayne who were not the real thespio historical john wayne  a film wayne s not to befucked with papa eventually litigated the kid s segment out of because the film had the word homo in the title     
on    with john wayne up at net  port washington s best boy throws up a lob  it s a beauty  the ball soars slowly up  just
skirts the indoor courts  system of beams and lamps  and floats back down gentle as lint  a lovely quad function of fluorescent
green  seams whirling  john wayne backpedals and flies back after it  you can tell   if you play seriously   you can tell just by
the way the ball comes off a guy s strings whether the lob is going to land fair  there s surprisingly little thought  coaches tell
serious players what to do so often it gets automatic  john wayne s game could be described as having a kind of automatic beauty 
when the lob first went up he d backpedaled from the net  keeping the ball in sight until it reached the top of its flight and its
curve broke  casting many shadows in the tray of lights hung from the ceiling s insulation  then wayne turned his back to the ball
and sprinted flat out for the spot where it will land fair  would land  he doesn t have to locate the ball again until it s hit the green
court just inside the baseline  by now he s come around the side of the bounced ball s flight  still sprinting  he looks mean in a
kind of distant way  he comes around the side of the bounced ball s second ascent the way you come up around the side of
somebody you re going to hurt  and he has to leave his feet and half pirouette to get his side to the ball and whip his big right arm
through it  catching it on the rise and slapping it down the line past the port washington boy  who s played the percentages and
followed a beauty of a lob up to net  the port washington kid applauds with the heel of his hand against his strings in
acknowledgment of a really nice get  even as he looks up at port washington s coaching staff in the gallery  the spectators  glass
panel is at ground level  and the players play below it on courts that have been carved out of a kind of pit  dug long ago  some
northeast clubs favor courts below ground  because earth insulates and keeps utility bills daunting instead of prohibitive  once the
lungs go up  the gallery panel stretches overhead behind courts   through    but there s a decided spectatorial clumping at the
part of the gallery that looks out over the show courts  boys     s    and     wayne and hal and p w t a  s two best  now after
wayne s balletic winner there s the sad sound of a small crowd behind glass s applause  on the courts the applause is muffled and
compromised by on court sounds  and sounds like the trapped survivors of something tapping for help at a great depth  the panel
is like an aquarium s glass  thick and clean  and traps noise behind it  and to the gallery it seems that    well muscled children are
arrayed and competing in total silence in the pit  almost everyone in the gallery is wearing tennis clothes and bright nylon warmups  some even wear wristbands  the tennis equivalent of a football fan s pennant and raccoon coat 
john wayne s post pirouette backward inertia has carried him into the heavy black tarpaulin that hangs several meters behind
both sides of the    courts on a system of rods and rings not unlike a very ambitious shower curtain  the tarps hiding from view
the waterstained walls of puffy white wrapped insulation and creating a narrow passage for players to get to their courts without
crossing open court and interrupting play  wayne hits the heavy tarp and kind of bounces off  producing a boom that resounds 
the sounds on court in an indoor venue are huge and complex  everything echoes and the echoes then meld  in the gallery  tavis
and nwangi bite their knuckles and delint squashes his nose flat against the glass in anxiety as everyone else politely applauds 
schtitt calmly taps his pointer against the top of his boot at times of high stress  wayne isn t hurt  though  everybody goes into the
tarp sometimes  that s what it s there for  it always sounds worse than it is 
the boom of the tarp sounds bad down below  though  the boom rattles teddy schacht  who s kneeling in the little passage
right behind court    holding m  pemulis s head as pemulis down on one knee is sick into a tall white plastic spare ball bucket 
schacht has to haul pemulis slightly back as wayne s outline bulges for a moment into the billowing tarp and threatens to knock
pemulis over  plus maybe the bucket  which would be a bad scene  pemulis  deep into the little hell of his own nauseous prematch nerves  is too busy trying to vomit w o sound to hear the mean sound of wayne s winner or the boom of him against the
heavy curtain  it s freezing back here in the little passage  up next to insulation and i beams and away from the infrared heaters
that hang over the courts  the plastic bucket is full of old bald wilson tennis balls and pemulis s breakfast  there is of course an
odor  schacht doesn t mind  he lightly strokes the sides of pemulis s head as his mother had stroked his own big sick head  back in
philly 
placed at eye level intervals in the tarp are little plastic windows  archer slit views of each court from the cold backstage
passage  schacht sees john wayne walk to the net post and flip his card as he and his opponent change sides  even indoors  you
change ends of the court after every odd numbered game  no one knows why odd rather than even  each p w t a  court has 
welded to its west net post  another smaller post with a double set of like flippable cards with big red numerals from   to    in
umpless competition you re supposed to flip your card appropriately at every change of sides  to help the gallery follow the score
in the set  a lot of junior players neglect to flip their cards  wayne is always automatic and scrupulous in his accounts  wayne s
father is an asbestos miner who at forty three is far and away the seniorest guy on his shift  he now wears triple thick masks and is
trying to hold on until john wayne can start making serious   and take him away from all this  he has not seen his eldest son play
since john wayne s que becois and canadian citizenships were revoked last year  wayne s card is on      his opponent has yet to
flip a card  wayne never even sits down to take the    seconds he s allowed on each change of sides  his opponent  in his light 

 blue flare collared shirt with wilson and p w t a  on the sleeves  says something not unfriendly as wayne brushes past him by
the post  wayne doesn t respond one way or the other  he just goes back to the baseline farthest from schacht s little tarp window
and bounces a ball up and down in the air with the reticulate face of his stick as the port washington boy sits in his little canvas
director s chair and towels the sweat off his arms  neither of which is large  and looks briefly up at the gallery behind the panel 
the thing about wayne is he s all business  his face on court is blankly rigid  with the hypertonic masking of schizophrenics and
zen adepts  he tends to look straight ahead at all times  he is about as reserved as they come  his emotions emerge in terms of
velocity  intelligence as strategic focus  his play  like his manner in general  seems to schacht less alive than undead  wayne
tends to eat and study alone  he s sometimes seen with two or three expatriate e t a  nucks  but when they re together they all
seem morose  it s wholly unclear to schacht how wayne feels about the u s  or his citizenship status  he figures wayne figures it
doesn t much matter  he is destined for the show  he will be an all business entertainer  citizen of the world  everywhere undead 
endorsing juice drinks and liniment ointment 
pemulis has nothing left and is spasming dryly over the bucket  his covered dunlop gut strung sticks and gear tumbled just
past schacht s in the passage  they are the last guys to get out on court  schacht is to play    singles on the    s b team  pemulis
   b  they are undeniably tardy getting out there  their opponents stand out on the baselines of courts   and    waiting for them
to come out and warm up  jittery  stretching out the way you do when you ve already stretched out  dribbling fresh bright balls
with their black wilson widebody sticks  the whole port washington tennis academy student body gets free and mandatory
wilson sticks under an administrative contract  nothing personal  but no way would schacht let an academy tell him what brand
of stick to swing  he himself favors head masters  which is regarded as bizarre and eccentric  the amf head rep brings them
out to him out of some cobwebby warehouse where they re kept since the line was discontinued during the large head revolution
many years back  aluminum head masters have small  perfectly round heads and a dull blue plastic brace in the v of the throat
and look less like weapons than toys  coyle and axford are always kibitzing that they ve seen a head master for sale at like a flea
market or garage sale someplace and schacht better get down there quick  schacht  who s historically tight with mario and with
lyle down in the weight room  where schacht  since the knee and the crohn s disease  likes to go even on off days  to work off
discomfort  and delint and loach are always on him about not getting musclebound   has a way of just smiling and holding his
tongue when he s kibitzed 
 are you okay  
pemulis says  blarg   he wipes at his forehead in a gesture of completion and submits to being hauled to his feet and stands
there on his own with his hands on his hips  slightly bent 
schacht straightens and pulls some wrinkles out of the bandage around the brace on his knee   take maybe another second 
wayne s already way up  
pemulis sniffs unpleasantly   how come this happens to me every time  this is not like me  
 happens to some people is all  
 this hunched spurting pale guy is not any me i ever recognize  
schacht gathers gear   some people their nerves are in their stomachs  cisne  yard guard  lord  you  stomach men  
 teddy brother man i m never once hung over for a competitive thing  i take elaborate precautions  not so much as a whippet 
i m always in bed the night before by      all pink cheeked and clean  
as they pass the plastic window behind court   schacht sees hal incan denza try to pass his serve and volley guy with a
baroque sideways slice down the backhand side and miss just wide  hal s card s already flipped to      schacht gives a little
toodleoo wave that hal can t see to acknowledge  pemulis is in front of him as they go down the cold passage 
 hal s way up too  another victory for the forces of peace  
 jesus i feel awful   pemulis says 
 things could be worse  
 expand on that  will you  
 this wasn t like that atlanta stomach incident  we were enclosed here  no one saw  you saw that glass  to schtitt and delint
it s all a silent movie down here  nobody heard thing one  our guys ll think we were back here butting heads to get enraged or
something  or we can tell them i got a cramp  that was a freebie  in terms of stomach incidents  
pemulis is a whole different person before competitive play 
t m fucking inept  
schacht laughs   you re one of the eptest people i know  get off your own back  
 never remember getting sick as a kid  now it s like i make myself sick just from worrying about getting sick  
 well then there you go  just don t think anything thoracic  pretend you don t have a stomach  
 i have no stomach   pemulis says  his head stays still when he talks  at least  negotiating the passage  he carries four sticks  a
rough white p w t a  locker room towel  an empty ball can full of high chlorine long island water  nervously zipping and
unzipping the top stick s cover  schacht only ever carries three sticks  his don t have covers on them  except for pemulis and
rader and unwin and a couple others who favor gut strings and really need protection  nobody at enfield uses racquet covers  it s
like an antifashion statement  people with covers make a point of telling you they re valid and for gut  a similar point of careful
nonpride is never having their shirts tucked in  ortho stice used to drill in cut off black jeans until schtitt had tony nwangi go
over and scream at him about it  each academy has its own style or antistyle  the p w t a  people  more or less a de facto
subsidiary of wilson  have unnecessary light blue wilson covers on all their courtside synthetic strung sticks and big red ws
stencilled onto their wilson synth gut strings  you have to let your company of choice spraypaint their logo on your strings if you
want to be on their free list for sticks  is the universal junior deal  schacht s orange gamma   synthetic strings have amf head
inc  s weird taoist paraboloid logo sprayed on  pemulis isn t on dunlop s free list     but gets the e t a  stringer to put
dunlop s dot and circumflex trademark on all his stick s strings  as a kind of touchingly insecure gesture  in schacht s opinion 
 i played your guy in tampa two years ago   pemulis says  sidestepping one of the old discolored drill balls that always litter
passages behind indoor tarps   name escapes  
 le something   says schacht   yet another nuck  one of those names that start with le   mario incandenza  in a pair of little

 audern tallat kelpsa s e t a  drill sweats  is lurching noiselessly some ten m  behind them in the passage  his police lock up and
head uncamera d  he s framing schacht s back in a three cornered box with his thumbs and long fingers  simulating the view
through a lens  mario s been authorized to travel with the squads to the whataburger invitational for final footage for his short and
upbeat annual documentary   brief testimonials and lighthearted moments and behind the scenes shots and emotional moments
on court  etc    that every year gets distributed to e t a  alumni and patrons and guests at the pre thanksgiving fundraising
exhibition and formal fete  mario is wondering how you could get enough light back here in a tarp tunnel to film a tense cold prematch gladiatorial march behind an indoor tarp  carrying tennis racquets in your arms like an obscene bouquet  without sacrificing
the dim and diffuse and kind of gladiatorially doomed quality figures in the dim passage have  after pemulis has mysteriously
won  he ll tell mario maybe a marino     with a diffusion filter on some kind of overhead cable you could winch along behind
the figures at about twice the focal length  or else use fast film and station the marino at the tunnel s very start and let the figures 
backs gradually recede into a kind of doomed mist of low exposure 
 i remember your guy as one big forehand  nothing but slice off the back  his vaps never varies  if you kick the serve over
to the backhand he ll slice it short  you can come in behind it at like will  
 worry about your own guy   schacht says 
 your guy s got zero imagination  
 and you ve got an empty expanse where your stomach ought to be  remember  
 i am a man with no stomach  
they emerge through flaps in the tarp with hands upraised in slight apology to their opponents  walk out onto the warmer
courts  the slow green eraserish footing of indoor composite  their ears dilate into all the sounds in the larger space  gasps and
thwaps and pocks and sneakers  squeaks  pemulis s court is almost down in female territory  courts    to    are girls     s a and
b  all bobbing ponytails and two handed backhands and high pitched grunts that if girls could only hear what their own grunts
sounded like they d cut it out  pemulis can t tell whether the very muffled applause way down up behind the gallery panel is
sardonic applause at his finally appearing after several minutes of vomiting or is sincerely for k  d  coyle on court    who s just
smashed a sucker lob so hard it s bounced up and racked   s tray of hanging lights  except for some rubber in his legs pemulis
feels stomachless and tentatively ok  this match is an all out must win for him in terms of the whataburger 
the infra lit courts are warm and soft  the heaters bolted into both walls above the tarp s upper hem are the deep warm red of
little square suns 
the port washington players all wear matching socks and shorts and tucked in shirts  they look sharp but effete  a
mannequinish aspect to them  most of the higher ranked e t a  students are free to sign on with different companies for no fees
but free gear  coyle is prince and reebok  as is trevor axford  john wayne is dunlop and adidas  schacht is head master sticks
but his own clothes and knee supports  ortho stice is wilson and all black fila  keith freer is fox sticks and both adidas and
reebok until one of the two companies  nne reps catches on  troeltsch is spalding and damn lucky to get that  hal incandenza is
dunlop and lightweight nike hightops and an air stirrup brace for the dicky ankle  shaw is kennex sticks and clothes from
tachani s big st tall line  pemulis s entrepreneurial vim has earned him complete freedom of choice and expense  though he s
barred by delint and nwangi from shirts that mention the sinn fein or that extol allston ma in any way  in competition 
before going back to the baseline and warming up groundstrokes schacht likes to take a little time courtside futzing around 
hitting his heads  frames against strings and listening for the pitch of best tension  arranging his towel on the back of his chair 
making sure his cards aren t still flipped from some previous match  etc   and then he prefers to sort of snuffle around his baseline
for a bit  checking for dustbunnies of ball fuzz and little divots or ridges from cold weather heave  adjusting the brace on his
ruined knee  putting his thick arms out cruciform and pulling them way back to stretch out the old pecs and cuffs  his opponent
waits patiently  twirling his poly butylene stick  and when they finally start to hit around  the guy s expression is pleasant  schacht
always prefers a pleasant match  one way or the other  he really doesn t care all that much whether he wins anymore  since first
the crohn s and then the knee at sixteen  he d probably now describe his desire to win as a preference  nothing more  what s
singular is that his tennis seems to have improved slightly in the two years since he stopped really caring  it s like his hard flat
game stopped having any purpose beyond itself and started feeding on itself and got fuller  looser  its edges less jagged  though
everybody else has been improving too  even faster  and schacht s rank has been steadily declining since sixteen  and the staff has
stopped talking even about a top college ride  schtitt s warmed to him  though  since the knee and the loss of any urge beyond the
play itself  and treats schacht now almost more like a peer than an experimental subject with something at stake  schacht is
already in his heart committed to a dental career  and he even interns twice a week for a root specialist over at the national
cranio facial pain foundation  in east enfield  when not touring 
it strikes schacht as odd that pemulis makes such a big deal of stopping all substances the day before competitive play but
never connects the neurasthenic stomach to any kind of withdrawal or dependence  he d never say this to pemulis unless pemulis
asked him directly  but schacht suspects pemulis is physically  drine dependent  preludin or tenuate or something  it s not his
business 
schacht s supposedly french canadian guy is as broad as schacht but shorter  his face dark and with a kind of eskimoid
structure to it  at eighteen his hairline recessed in the sort of way where you just know the kid s already got hair on his back  and
he warms up with crazy spins  moony top off a western forehand and weird inside out shit off a one hand back  his knees dipping
oddly whenever he makes contact and his follow through full of the dancerly flourishes that characterize a case of nerves  a
nervous spin artist can be eaten more or less for lunch  if you hit as hard as schacht does  and what pemulis said is true  the guy s
backhand is always sliced and lands shallow  schacht looks over at pemulis s guy  a grunter with a moody profile and the storky
look of recent puberty  pemulis is looking oddly sanguine and confident after a couple minutes futzing with the cans of water 
rinsing out the oral cavity and so on  pemulis is maybe going to win  too  despite himself  schacht figures he can run in and get
one of the twelve year olds he big buddies to go back into the passage and empty pemulis s bucket on the sly before anybody
coming off court sees it  evidence of nervous incapacity of any kind gets noted and logged  at e t a   and schacht s observed
pemulis having some kind of vested emotional interest in attending the whataburger inv  over thanksgiving  he thought mario s
lurking around in the cold passage scratching his poor big head over technical lighting problems was kind of funny  there will be

 no lungs or tarps or dim passages at the whataburger  the tucson tournament is outside  and tucson cruised around     c even
in november  and the sun there was a retinal horror show on overheads and serves 
though schacht buys quarterly urine like the rest of them  it seems to pemulis that schacht ingests the occasional chemical
that way grownups who sometimes forget to finish their cocktails drink liquor  to make a tense but fundamentally ok interior life
interestingly different but no more  no element of relief  a kind of tourism  and schacht doesn t even have to worry about
obsessive training like inc or stice or get sick so often from the physical stress of constant  drines like troeltsch or suffer from
thinly disguised psychological fallout like inc or struck or pemulis himself  the way pemulis and troeltsch and struck and
axford ingest substances and recover from substances and have a whole jargony argot based around various substances gives
schacht the creeps  a bit  but since the knee injury broke and remade him at sixteen he s learned to go his own interior way and let
others go theirs  like most very large men  he s getting comfortable early with the fact that his place in the world is very small and
his real impact on other persons even smaller   which is a big reason he can sometimes forget to finish his portion of a given
substance  so interested does he become in the way he s already started to feel  he s one of these people who don t need much 
much less much more 
schacht and his opponent warm up their groundstrokes with the fluid economy of years of warming up groundstrokes  they
take turns feeding each other some volleys at net and then each take a  couple up   lobs  hitting loose easy overheads  slowly
adjusting the idle from half speed to three quarter speed  the knee feels fundamentally all right  springy  slow indoor composite
surfaces do not like schacht s hard flat game  but they are kind to the knee  which after some days outside on hard cement swells
to about the size of a volleyball  schacht feels blandly happy down here on    playing in private  way down past the gallery s
panel  there is a nourishing sense of pregnable space in a big indoor club that you never get playing outside  especially playing
outside in the cold  when the balls feel hard and sullen and come off the stick s strung face with an echoless ping  here everything
cracks and booms  the grunts and shoe squeaks and booming pocks of impact and curses unfolding across the white on green
plane and echoing off each tarp  soon they ll all go inside for the winter  schtitt will yield and let them inflate the e t a  lung
over the sixteen center courts  it s like a barn raising  inflation day  it s communal and fun  and they ll take down the central
fences and outdoor night lamps and unbolt all the posts into sections and stack them and store them  and the testar and
athscme guys will come up in vans smoking cigarettes and squinting with weary expertise at tubes of plans in draftsman blue 
and there ll be one and sometimes two athscme helicopters w  slings and grappling hooks for the lung s dome and nacelle  and
schtitt and delint will let the younger e t a s get the infrared indoor heaters out of the same corrugated shed the disassembled
fences and lamps will go in  leaf cutter ant  or korean like armies of     and    year olds carrying sections and heaters and goretex swatches and long halo lithiated bulbs while the   s get to sit on canvas chairs and kibitz because they did their leaf cutter
lung raising bits at       already  two testar guys ll supervise otis p  lord and all this year s conspicuous tech wonks in
mounting the heaters and stringing the lights and running coaxial shunts with ceramic jacks between the pump room s main
breaker and the sunstrand grid and booting up the circulation fans and pneumatic hoists that ll raise the lung to the inflated shape
of a distended igloo  sixteen courts in four rows of four  enclosed and warmed by nothing but fibrous gore tex and ac current
and an enormous athscme exhaust flow effectuator that an athscme crew in one of the athscme helicopters will bring
in in a sling and cable and mount and secure on the lung s nipply nacelle at the top of the inflating dome  and that first night after
inflation  traditionally the fourth monday of november  all the upperclass   s so inclined will crank up the infrareds and get high
and eat low lipid microwave pizza and play all night  sweating magnificently  sheltered for the winter atop enfield s levelheaded
hill 
schacht stands back in the deuce court and lets his guy warm up his serves  oddly flat and low margin for a nervous touchartist  schacht bloops each return up with severe backspin so the balls ll roll back to him and he can serve them back to his guy 
also warming up  the warm up routine has become automatic and requires no attention  way up on  l  schacht sees john wayne
just plaster a backhand cross court  wayne hits it so hard a little mushroom cloud of green fuzz hangs in the air where ball had
met strings  their cards were too far to read in the sour apple light  but you could tell by the way port washington s best boy
walked back to the baseline to take the next serve that his ass had already been presented to him  in a lot of junior matches
everything past the fourth game or so is kind of a formality  both players tend to know the overall score by then  the big picture 
they ll have decided who s going to lose  competitive tennis is largely mental  once you re at a certain plateau of skill and
conditioning  schtitt d say spiritual instead of mental  but as far as schacht can see it s the same thing  as schacht sees it  schtitt s
philosophical stance is that to win enough of the time to be considered successful you have to both care a great deal about it and
also not care about it at all      schacht does not care enough  probably  anymore  and has met his gradual displacement from
e t a  s a singles squad with an equanimity some e t a  s thought was spiritual and others regarded as the surest sign of
dicklessness and burnout  only one or two people have ever used the word brave in connection with schacht s radical
reconfiguration after the things with the crohn s disease and knee  hal incandenza  who s probably as asymetrically hobbled on
the care too much side as schacht is on the not enough  privately puts schacht s laissez faire down to some interior decline  some
doom gray surrender of his childhood s promise to adult gray mediocrity  and fears it  but since schacht is an old friend and a
dependable designated driver and has actually gotten pleasanter to be around since the knee   which hal prays fervently that the
ankle won t start being the size of a volleyball itself at the end of each outdoor day   hal in a weird and deeper internal way
almost somehow admires and envies the fact that schacht s stoically committed himself to the oral professions and stopped
dreaming of getting to the show after graduation   an air of something other than failure about schacht s not caring enough 
something you can t quite define  the way you can t quite remember a word that you know you know  inside   hal can t quite feel
the contempt for teddy schacht s competitive slide that would be a pretty much natural contempt in one who cared so dreadfully
secretly much  and so the two of them tend to settle for not talking about it  just as schacht cheerfully wordlessly drives the tow
truck on occasions when the rest of the crew are so incapacitated they d have to hold one eye closed even to see an undoubled
road  and consents w o protest to pay retail for clean quarterly urine  and doesn t say a word about hal s devolution from
occasional tourist to subterranean compulsive  substance wise  with his pump room visits and visine  even though schacht deep
down believes that the substance compulsion s strange apparent contribution to hal s erumpent explosion up the rankings has got
to be a temporary thing  that there s like a psychic credit card bill for hal in the mail  somewhere  coming  and is sad for him in

 advance about whatever s surely got to give  eventually  though it won t be the boards  hal ll murder his boards  and schacht
may well be among those jockeying to sit near him  he d be the first to admit  on   hal now kicks a second serve to the ad court
with so much left handed top on it that it almost kicks up over port washington s    guy s head  it s clearly carnage up there on
show courts   and    dr  tavis will be irrepressible  the gallery is barely even applauding wayne and incandenza anymore  at a
certain point it becomes like romans applauding lions  all the coaches and staff and p w t a  parents and civilians in the
overhead gallery wear tennis outfits  the high white socks and tucked in shirts of people who do not really play 
schacht and his man play 
both pat montesian and gately s aa sponsor like to remind gately how this new resident geoffrey day could end up being
an invaluable teacher of patience and tolerance for him  gately  as ennet house staff 
 so then at forty six years of age i came here to learn to live by cliches   is what day says to charlotte treat right after randy
lenz asked what time it was  again  at        to turn my will and life over to the care of cliches  one day at a time  easy does it 
first things first  courage is fear that has said its prayers  ask for help  thy will not mine be done  it works if you work it  grow
or go  keep coming back  
poor old charlotte treat  needlepointing primly beside him on the old vinyl couch that just came from goodwill  purses her
lips   you need to ask for some gratitude  
 oh no but the point is i ve already been fortunate enough to receive gratitude   day crosses one leg over the other in a way
that inclines his whole little soft body toward her   for which  believe you me  i m grateful  i cultivate gratitude  that s part of the
system of cliches i m here to live by  an attitude of gratitude  a grateful drunk will never drink  i know the actual cliche is  a
grateful heart will never drink   but since organs can t properly be said to imbibe and i m still afflicted with just enough self will to
decline to live by utter non sequiturs  as opposed to just good old cliches  i m taking the liberty of light amendment   he gives with
this a look like butter wouldn t melt   albeit grateful amendment  of course  
charlotte treat looks over to gately for some sort of help or staff enforcement of dogma  the poor bitch is clueless  all of
them are clueless  still  gately reminds himself that he too is probably mostly still clueless  still  even after all these hundreds of
days   i didn t know that i didn t know  is another of the slogans that looks so shallow for a while and then all of a sudden drops
off and deepens like the lobster waters off the north shore  as gately fidgets his way through daily a m  meditation he always
tries to remind himself daily that this is all an ennet house residency is supposed to do  buy these poor yutzes some time  some
thin pie slice of abstinent time  till they can start to get a whiff of what s true and deep  almost magic  under the shallow surface of
what they re trying to do 
 i cultivate it assiduously  i do special gratitude exercises at night up there in the room  gratitude ups  you could call them 
ask randy over there if i don t do them like clockwork  diligently  sedulously  
 well it s true is all   treat sniffs   about gratitude  
everybody else except gately  lying on the old other couch opposite them  is ignoring this exchange  watching an old
interlace cartridge whose tracking is a little messed up so that staticky stripes eat at the screen s picture s bottom and top  day is
not done talking  pat m  encourages newer staff to think of residents they d like to bludgeon to death as valuable teachers of
patience  tolerance  self discipline  restraint 
day is not done talking   one of the exercises is being grateful that life is so much easier now  i used sometimes to think  i
used to think in long compound sentences with subordinate clauses and even the odd polysyllable  now i find i needn t  now i
live by the dictates of macrame samplers ordered from the back page ad of an old reader s digest or saturday evening post  easy
does it  remember to remember  but for the grace of capital g god  turn it over  terse  hard boiled  monosyllabic  good old
norman rockwell paul harvey wisdom  i walk around with my arms out straight in front of me and recite these cliches  in a
monotone  no inflection necessary  could that be one  could that be added to the cliche pool   no inflection necessary   too
many syllables  probably  
randy lenz says  i ain t got time for this shit  
poor old charlotte treat  all of nine weeks clean  is trying to look primmer and primmer  she looks again over to gately 
lying on his back  taking up the living room s whole other sofa  one sneaker up on the sofa s square frayed fabric arm thing  his
eyes almost closed  only staff get to lie on the couches 
 denial   charlotte finally says   is not a river in egypt    hows about the both of you shut the fuck up   says emil minty 
geoffrey  not geoff  geoffrey  day has been at ennet house six days  he came from roxbury s infamous dimock detox  where
he was the only white person  which gately bets must have been broadening for him  day has a squished blank smeared flat face 
one requiring like great self effort to like  and eyes that are just starting to lose the nictitated glaze of early sobriety  day is a
newcomer and a wreck  a red wine and quaalude man who finally nodded out in late october and put his saab through the
window of a maiden sporting goods store and then got out and proceeded to browse until the finest came and got him  who
taught something horseshit sounding like social historicity or historical sociality at some jr  college up the expressway in medford
and came in saying on his intake he also manned the helm of a scholarly quarterly  word for word  the house manager had said 
 manned the helm   and  scholarly   his intake estimated that day s been in and out of a blackout for most of the last several years 
and his wiring is still as they say a bit frayed  his detox at dimock  where they barely have the resources to give you a librium if
you start to d t   must have been just real grim  because geoffrey d  alleges it never happened  now his story is he just strolled
into ennet house on a lark one day from his home     clicks away in maiden and found the place too hilariously egregulous to
want to ever leave  it s the newcomers with some education that are the worst  according to gene m  they identify their whole
selves with their head  and the disease makes its command headquarters in the head      day wears chinos of indeterminate hue 
brown socks with black shoes  and shirts that pat montesian had described in the intake as  eastern european type hawaiian
shirts   day s now on the vinyl couch with charlotte treat after breakfast in the ennet house living room with a few of the other
residents that either aren t working or don t have to be at work early  and with gately  who d pulled an all night dream duty shift
out in the front office till       then got temp relieved by johnette foltz so he could go to work janitoring down at the shattuck
shelter till       then came and hauled ass back up here and took back over so s that johnette could go off to her na thing with a
bunch of na people in what looked like a dune buggy if the dunes in question were in hell  and is now  gately  trying to unclench

 and center himself inside by tracing the cracks in the paint of the living room ceiling with his eyes  gately often feels a terrible
sense of loss  narcotics wise  in the a m   still  even after this long clean  his sponsor over at the white flag group says some
people never get over the loss of what they d thought was their one true best friend and lover  they just have to pray daily for
acceptance and the brass danglers to move forward through the grief and loss  to wait for time to harden the scab  the sponsor 
ferocious francis g   doesn t give gately one iona of shit for feeling some negative feelings about it  on the contrary  he
commends gately for his candor in breaking down and crying like a baby and telling him about it early one a m  over the pay
phone  the sense of loss  it s a myth no one misses it  their particular substance  shit  you wouldn t need help if you didn t miss it 
you just have to ask for help and like turn it over  the loss and pain  to keep coming  show up  pray  ask for help  gately
rubs his eye  simple advice like this does seem like a lot of cliches   day s right about how it seems  yes  and if geoffrey day
keeps on steering by the way things seem to him then he s a dead man for sure  gately s already watched dozens come through
here and leave early and go back out there and then go to jail or die  if day ever gets lucky and breaks down  finally  and comes
to the front office at night to scream that he can t take it anymore and clutch at gately s pantcuff and blubber and beg for help at
any cost  gately ll get to tell day the thing is that the cliched directives are a lot more deep and hard to actually do  to try and live
by instead of just say  but he ll only get to say it if day comes and asks  personally  gately gives geoffrey d  like a month at the
outside before he s back tipping his hat to parking meters  except who is gately to judge who ll end up getting the gift of the
program v  who won t  he needs to remember  he tries to feel like day is teaching him patience and tolerance  it takes great
patience and tolerance not to want to punt the soft little guy out into the comm  ave  ravine and open up his bunk to somebody
that really desperately wants it  the gift  except who is gately to think he can know who wants it and who doesn t  deep down 
gately s arm is behind his head  up against the sofa s other arm  the old d e c  viewer is on to something violent and colorenhanced gately neither sees nor hears  it was part of his gifts as a burglar  he can sort of turn his attention on and off like a light 
even when he was a resident here he d had this prescient housebreaker s ability to screen input  to do sensory triage  it was one
reason he d even been able to stick out his nine residential months here with twenty one other newly detoxed housebreakers 
hoods  whores  fired execs  avon ladies  subway musicians  beer bloated construction workers  vagrants  indignant car salesmen 
bulimic trauma mamas  bunko artists  mincing pillow biters  north end hard guys  pimply kids with electric noserings  denialridden housewives and etc   all jonesing and head gaming and mokus and grieving and basically whacked out and producing
nonstopping output          
at some point in here day s saying  so bring on the lobotomist  bring him on i say  
except gately s own counselor when he was a resident here  eugenio martinez  one of the volunteer alumni counselors  a
one eared former boiler room bunko man and now a cellular phone retailer who d hooked up with the house under the original
founder guy that didn t even use his first name  and had about ten years clean  gene m  did   eugenio d lovingly confronted
gately early on about his special burglar s selective attention and about how it could be dangerous because how can you be sure
it s you doing the screening and not the spider  gene called the disease the spider and talked about feeding the spider versus
starving the spider and so on and so forth  eugenio m  had called gately into the house manager s back office and said what if
don s screening input turned out to be feeding the old spider and what about an experimental unscreening of input for a while 
gately had said he d do his best to try and d come back out and tried to watch a spont dissem of the celtics while two resident
pillow biters from the fenway were having this involved conversation about some third fag having to go in and get the skeleton of
some kind of fucking rodent removed from inside their butthole      the unscreening experiment had lasted half an hour  this
was right before gately got his    day chip and wasn t exactly wrapped real tight or real tolerant  still  ennet house this year is
nothing like the freakshow it was when gately went through 
gately has been completely substance free for     days today 
ms  charlotte treat  with a carefully made up  ruined face  is watching the viewer s stripe shot cartridge while she
needlepoints something  conversation between her and geoffrey d  has mercifully petered out  day is scanning the room for
somebody else to engage and piss off so he can prove to himself he doesn t fit in here and stay separated off isolated inside himself
and maybe get them so pissed off there s a beef and he gets bounced out  day  and it won t be his fault  you can almost hear his
disease chewing away inside his head  feeding  emil minty  randy lenz  and bruce green are also in the room  sprawled in
spring shot chairs  lighting one gasper off the end of the last  their postures the don t fuck with me slouch of the streets that here
makes their bodies  texture somehow hard to distinguish from that of the chairs  nell gunther is sitting at the long table in the

who s without not only hands and feet but arms and legs and even a head and who communicates by farting in morris code  this
sally earned glynn three days full house restriction and a week s extra chore for what johnette foltz described in the log as
 xsive cruetly   there is a vague intestinal moaning in gately s right side  watching burt f  smith smoke a benson   hedges by
holding it between his stumps with his elbows out like a guy with pruning shears is an adventure in fucking pathos as far as
gately s concerned  and geoffrey day cracks wise about there but for grace  and forget about what it s like trying to watch burt
f  smith try and light a match 
gately  who s been on live in staff here four months now  believes charlotte treat s devotion to needlepoint is suspect  all

 those needles  in and out of all that thin sterile white cotton stretched drum tight in its round frame  the needle makes a kind of
thud and squeak when it goes in the cloth  it s not much like the soundless pop and slide of a real cook and shoot  but still  she
takes such great care 
gately wonders what color he d call the ceiling if forced to call it a color  it s not white and it s not gray  the brown yellow
tones are from high tar gaspers  a pall hangs up near the ceiling even this early in the new sober day  some of the drunks and
tranq jockeys stay up most of the night  joggling their feet and chain smoking  even though there s no cartridges or music allowed

dining rooms without really looking  emil minty  a hard core smack addict punk here for reasons nobody can quite yet pin down 
is in an old mustard colored easy chair with his combat boots up on one of the standing ashtrays  which is tilting not quite enough
for gately to tell him to watch out  please  minty s orange mohawk and the shaved skull around it are starting to grow out brown 
which is just not a pleasant sight in the morning at all  the other ashtray on the floor by his chair is full of the ragged little new
moons of bitten nails  which has got to mean that the hester t  that he d ordered to bed at      was right back down here in the
chair going at her nails again the second gately left to mop shit at the shelter  when he s up all night gately s stomach gets all
tight and acidy  from either all the coffee maybe or just staying up  minty s been on the streets since he was like sixteen  gately
can tell  he s got that sooty complexion homeless guys get where the soot has insinuated itself into the dermal layer and thickened 
making minty look somehow upholstered  and the big armed driver for leisure time ice  the quiet kid  green  a garbage head
all substance type kid  maybe twenty one  face very slightly smunched in on one side  wears sleeveless khaki shirts and had lived
in a trailer in that apocalyptic enfield trailer park out near the allston spur  gately likes green because he seems to have got sense
enough to keep his map shut when he s got nothing important to say  which is basically all the time  the tattoo on the kid s right
tricep is a spear pierced heart over the hideous name mildred bonk  who bruce g  told him was a ray of living light and a
dead ringer for the late lead singer of the fiends in human shape and his dead heart s one love ever  and who took their daughter
and left him this summer for some guy that told her he ranched fucking longhorn cows east of atlantic city nj  he s got  even by
ennet house standards  major league sleep trouble  green  and he and gately play cribbage sometimes in the wee dead hours  a
game gately picked up in jail  burt f s  is now hunched in a meaty coughing fit  his elbows out and his forehead purple  no sign
of hester thrale  nailbiter and something pat calls borderline  gately can see everything without moving or moving his head or
either eye  also in here is randy lenz  who lenz is a small time organic coke dealer who wears sportcoats rolled up over his
parlor tanned forearms and is always checking his pulse on the inside of his wrists  it s come out that lenz is of keen interest to
both sides of the law because this past may he d apparently all of a sudden lost all control and holed up all of a sudden in a
charlestown motel and free based most of a whole     grams he d been fronted by a suspiciously trusting brazilian in what lenz
didn t know was supposed to have been a d e a  sting operation in the south end  having screwed both sides in what gately
secretly views as a delicious fuck up  randy lenz has  since may  been the most wanted he s probably ever been  he is seedily
handsome in the way of pimps and low level coke dealers  muscular in the mp ish way that certain guys  muscles look muscular
but can t really lift anything  with complexly gelled hair and the little birdlike head movements of the deeply vain  one forearm s
hair has a little hairless patch  which gately knows well spells knife owner  and if there s one thing gately s never been able to
stomach it s a knife owner  little swaggery guys that always queer a square beef and come up off the ground with a knife where
you have to get cut to take it away from them  lenz is teaching gately reserved politeness to people you pretty much want to beat
up on sight  it s pretty obvious to everybody except pat montesian   whose odd gullibility in the presence of human sludge 
though  gately needs to try to remember had been one of the reasons why he himself had got into ennet house  originally  
obvious that lenz is here mostly just to hide out  he rarely leaves the house except under compulsion  avoids windows  and
travels to the nightly required aa na meetings in a disguise that makes him look like cesar romero after a terrible accident  and
then he always wants to walk back to the house solo afterward  which is not encouraged  lenz is seated low in the
northeasternmost corner of an old fake velour love seat he s jammed in the northeasternmost corner of the living room  randy
lenz has a strange compulsive need to be north of everything  and possibly even northeast of everything  and gately has no clue
what it s about but observes lenz s position routinely for his own interest and files  lenz s leg  like ken erdedy s leg  never stops
joggling  day claims it joggles even worse in sleep  another gurgle and abdominal chug for don g   lying there  charlotte treat
has violently red hair  as in hair the color of like a red crayon  the reason she doesn t have to work an outside menial job is she s
got some strain of the virus or like h i v  former prostitute  reformed  why do prostitutes when they get straight always try and
get so prim  it s like long repressed librarian ambitions come flooding out  charlotte t  has a cut rate whore s hard half pretty
face  her eyes lassoed with shadow around all four lids  her also with a case of the dermal layer sooty complexion  the riveting
thing about treat is how her cheeks are deeply pitted in these deep trenches that she packs with foundation and tries to cover over
with blush  which along with the hair gives her the look of a mean clown  the ghastly wounds in her cheeks look for all the world
like somebody got at her with a woodburning kit at some point in her career path  gately would rather not know

by the prince valiantish haircut he tries to maintain himself in the mirror  to save    room and board aside   plus the opportunity
for service   he makes very little as an ennet house staffer  and is paying off restitution schedules in three different district
courts  he has the fluttery white eyed smile now of someone who s holding himself just over the level of doze  pat montesian is

people in leather and metal  preening  rooms full of randy lenzes  all hugging each other  pretending they don t miss the

meeting s rear  like gately when he first came  retired old kindergarten teachers in polyresin slacks and a pince nez who bake
cookies for the weekly meeting and relate from behind the podium how they used to blow bartenders at closing for just two more
fingers in a paper cup to take home against the morning s needled light  gately  albeit an oral narcotics man from way back  has
committed himself to aa  he drank his fair share  too  he figures  after all 
exec  director pat m  is due in at      and has application interviews with three people   f and  m  who better be showing
up soon  and gately will answer the door when they don t know enough to just come in and will say welcome and get them a cup
of coffee if he judges them able to hold it  he ll get them aside and tip them off to be sure to pet pat m  s dogs during the
interview  they ll be sprawled all over the front office  sides heaving  writhing and biting at themselves  he ll tell them it s a
proved fact that if pat s dogs like you  you re in  pat m  has directed gately to tell appliers this  and then if the appliers do actually
pet the dogs   two hideous white golden retrievers with suppurating scabs and skin afflictions  plus one has grand mall epilepsy
  it ll betray a level of desperate willingness that pat says is just about all she goes by  deciding 
a nameless cat oozes by on the broad windowsill above the back of the fabric couch  animals here come and go  alumni

line this morning was chemically pink  trails of industrial exhaust blowing due north  the nail parings in the ashtray on the floor
are  he realizes now  too big to be from fingernails  these bitten arcs are broad and thick and a deep autumnal yellow  he
swallows hard  he d tell geoffrey day how  even if they are just cliches  cliches are  a  soothing  and  b  remind you of common
sense  and  c  license the universal assent that drowns out silence  and     silence is deadly  pure spider food  if you ve got the
disease  gene m  says you can spell the disease dis ease  which sums the basic situation up nicely  pat has a meeting at the
division of substance abuse services in government center at noon she needs to be reminded about  she can t read her own
handwriting  which the stroke affected her handwriting  gately envisions going around having to find out who s biting their
fucking toenails in the living room and putting the disgusting toenail bits in the ashtray at like       plus house regs prohibit bare
feet anyplace downstairs  there s a pale brown water stain on the ceiling over day and treat the almost exact shape of florida 
randy lenz has issues with geoffrey day because day is glib and a teacher at a scholarly journal s helm  this threatens the selfconcept of a randy lenz that thinks of himself as a kind of hiply sexy artist intellectual  small time dealers never conceptualize
themselves as just small time dealers  kind of like whores never do  for occupation on his intake form lenz had put free lance
script writer  and he makes a show of that he reads  for the first week here in july he d held the books upside down in the
northeast corner of whatever room  he had a gigantic medical dictionary he d haul down and smoke and read until annie parrot
the asst  manager had to tell him not to bring it down anymore because it was fucking with morris hanley s mind  at which juncture he quit reading and started talking  making everybody nostalgic for when he just sat there and read  geoffrey d  has issues
with randy l   also  you can tell  there s a certain way they don t quite look at each other  and so now of course they re mashed
together in the   man together  since three guys in one night missed curfew and came in without one normal sized pupil between
them and refused urines and got bounced on the spot  and so day gets moved up in his first week from the   man room to the  man  seniority comes quick around here  past minty  down at the dining room table s end  burt f s  s still coughing  still hunched
over  his face a dusky purple  and nell g  is behind him pounding him on the back so that it keeps sending him forward over his
ashtray  and he s waving one stump vaguely over his shoulder to try and signal her to quit  lenz and day  a beef may be brewing 
day ll try to goad lenz into a beef that ll be public enough so he doesn t get hurt but does get bounced  and then he can leave
treatment and go back to chianti and  ludes and getting assaulted by sidewalks and make out like the relapse is ennet house s
fault and never have to confront himself or his disease  to gately  day is like a wide open interactive textbook on the disease 
one of gately s jobs is to keep an eye on what s possibly brewing among residents and let pat or the manager know and try to
smooth things down in advance if possible  the ceiling s color could be called dun  if forced  someone has farted  no one knows
just who  but this isn t like a normal adult place where everybody coolly pretends a fart didn t happen  here everybody has to make
their little comment 
time is passing  ennet house reeks of passing time  it is the humidity of early sobriety  hanging and palpable  you can hear
ticking in clockless rooms here  gately changes the angle of one sneaker  puts the other arm behind his head  his head has real
weight and pressure  randy lenz s obsessive compulsions include the need to be north  a fear of disks  a tendency to constantly
take his own pulse  a fear of all forms of timepieces  and a need to always know the time with great precision 
 day man you got the time maybe real quick   lenz  for the third time in half an hour  patience  tolerance  compassion  selfdiscipline  restraint 
gately remembers his first six months here straight  he d felt the sharp edge of every second that went by  and the freakshow
dreams  nightmares beyond the worst d t s you d ever heard about  a reason for a night shift staffer in the front office is so
somebody s there for the residents to talk at when   not if  when   when the freakshow dreams ratchet them out of bed at like
      nightmares about relapsing and getting high  not getting high but having everybody think you re high  getting high with
your alcoholic mom and then killing her with a baseball bat  whipping the old unit out for a spot urine and starting up and flames
coming shooting out  getting high and bursting into flames  having a waterspout shaped like an enormous talwin suck you up
inside  a vehicle explodes in an enhanced bloom of sooty flame on the d e c  viewer  its hood up like an old pop tab 
day s making a broad gesture out of checking his watch   right around       fella  
randy l  s fine nostrils flare and whiten  he stares straight ahead  eyes narrowed  fingers on his wrist  day purses his lips  leg
joggling  gately hangs his head over the arm of the sofa and regards lenz upside down 
 that look on your map there mean something there  randy  are you like communicating something with that look  
 does anybody maybe know the time a little more exactly is what i m wondering  don  since day doesn t  
gately checks his own cheap digital  head still hung over the sofa s arm   i got                  randy  
 ks a lot  d g  man  
so and now day has that same flared narrow look for lenz   we ve been over this  friend  amigo  sport  you do this all the

 time with me  again i ll say it   i don t have a digital watch  this is a fine old antique watch  it points  a memento of far better
days  it s not a digital watch  it s not a cesium based atomic clock  it points  with hands  see  spiro agnew here has two little
arms  they point  they suggest  it s not a sodding stopwatch for life  lenz  get a watch  am i right  why don t you just get a watch 
lenz  three people i happen to know of for a fact have offered to get you a watch and you can pay them back whenever you feel
comfortable about poking your nose out and investigating the work a world  get a watch  obtain a watch  a fine  digital 
incredibly wide watch  about five times the width of your wrist  so you have to hold it like a falconer  and it treats time like pi  
 easy does it   charlotte treat half sings  not looking up from her needle and frame 
day looks around at her   i don t believe i was speaking to you in any way shape or form  
lenz stares at him   if you re trying to fuck with me  brother   he shakes his fine shiny head   big mistake  
 oo i m all atremble  i can barely hold my arm steady to read my watch  
 big big big real big mistake  
 peace on earth good will toward men   says gately  back on his back  smiling at the dun cracked ceiling  he s the one who d

they returned from long island bearing their shields rather than upon them  as they say  john wayne and hal incandenza lost
only five total games between them in singles  the a doubles had resembled a spatterpainting  and the b teams  especially the
distaffs  had surpassed themselves  the whole p w t a  staff and squad had had to sing a really silly song  coyle and troeltsch
didn t win  and teddy schacht had  incredibly  lost to his squat spin doctory opponent in three sets  despite the kid s debilitating
nerves at crucial junctures  the fact that schacht wasn t all that upset got remarked on by staff  schacht and a conspicuously
energized jim troeltsch rallied for the big win in    a    dubs  though  troeltsch s disconnected microphone mysteriously
disappeared from his gear bag during post doubles showers  to the rejoicing of all  pemulis s storky intense two hands off bothsides opponent had gotten weirdly lethargic and then disoriented in the second set after pemulis had lost the first in a tie break 
after the kid had delayed play for several minutes claiming the tennis balls were too pretty to hit  p w t a  trainers had conducted
him gently from the court  and the peemster got  v d    which is jr  circuit argot for a victory by default  the fact that pemulis
hadn t walked around with his chest out recounting the win for any e t a  females got remarked on only by hal and t  axford 
schacht was in too much knee pain to remark on much of anything  and schtitt had e t a  s barry loach inject the big purple
knee with something that made schacht s eyes roll up in his head 
then during the post meet mixer and dance pemulis s defaulted opponent ate from the hors d  oeuvres table without using
utensils or at one point even hands  did a disco number when there wasn t any music going  and was finally heard telling the port
washington headmaster s wife that he d always wanted to do her from behind  pemulis spent a lot of time whistling and staring
innocently up at the pre fab ceiling 
the bus for all the    s squads was warm and there were little nozzles of light over your seat that you could either have on to
do homework or shut off and sleep  troeltsch  left eye ominously nystagmic  pretended to recap the day s match highlights for a
subscription audience  speaking earnestly into his fist  the c team s stockhausen was pretending to sing opera  hal and tall paul
shaw were each reading an sat prep guide  a good quarter of the bus was yellow highlighting copies of e  a  abbott s
inescapable at e t a  book flatland for either flottman or chawaf or thorp  an elongated darkness with assorted shapes melted
by  plus long gauntlets  near exits  of tall interstatish lamps laying down cones of dirty looking sodium light  the ghastly sodium
lamplight made mario incandenza happy to be in his little cone of white inside light  mario sat next to k  d  coyle   who was
kind of mentally slow  especially after a hard loss   and they played rock paper scissors for two hundred clicks or more  not
saying anything  engrossed in trying to locate patterns in each other s rhythms of choices of shapes  which they both decided there
weren t any  two or three upper classmen in levy richardson o byrne chawaf s disciplinary lit  were slumped over
goncharov s oblomov  looking very unhappy indeed  charles tavis sat way in the back with john wayne and beamed and spoke
nonstop in hushed tones to wayne as the canadian stared out the window  delint was with the    s one bus back  he d been
ragging slice s and korn span s asses since their doubles  which it looked like they practically gave away  the bus was schtittless 
schtitt always found a private mysterious way back  then appeared at dawn drills with delint and elaborate work ups of
everything that had gone wrong the day before  he was particularly shrill and insistent and negative after they d won something 
schacht sat listing to port and didn t respond when hands were waved in front of his face  and axford and struck started kibitzing
barry loach about their knees were feeling punk as well  the luggage rack over everyone s heads bristled with grips and coverless
strings  and liniment and tincture of benzoin had been handed out and liberally applied  so the warm air became complexly spiced 
everybody was tired in a good way 
the homeward ride s camaraderie was marred only by the fact that someone near the back of the bus started the passing
around of a gothic fonted leaflet offering the kingdom of prehistoric england to the man who could pull keith freer out of
bernadette longley  freer had been discovered by prorector mary esther thode more or less xing poor bernadette longley under
an adidas blanket in the very back seat on the bus trip to the east coast clays in providence in september  and it had been a nasty
scene  because there were some basic academy license rules that it was just unacceptable to flout under the nose of staff  keith
freer was deeply asleep when the leaflet was getting passed around  but bernadette longley wasn t  and when the leaflet hit the
front half where all the females now had to sit since september she d buried her face in her hands and flushed even on the back of
her pretty neck  and her doubles partner     came all the way back to where jim struck and michael pemulis were sitting and
told them in no uncertain terms that somebody on this bus was so immature it was really sad 
charles tavis was irrepressible  he did a pierre trudeau impersonation no one except the driver was old enough to laugh at 
and the whole mammoth travelling squad  three buses  worth  got to stop and have the mega breakfast at denny s  over next to
empire waste  at like       when they got in 

hal s eldest brother orin incandenza got out of competitive tennis when hal was nine and mario nearly eleven  this was
during the period of great pre experialist upheaval and the emergence of the fringe c u s p  of johnny gentle  famous crooner 
and the tumescence of o n a n ism  at late seventeen  orin was ranked in the low   s nationally  he was a senior  he was at that

 awful age for a low   s player where age eighteen and the terminus of a junior career are looming and either      you re going to
surrender your dreams of the show and go to college and play college tennis  or     you re going to get your full spectrum of
gram negative and cholera and amoebic dysentery shots and try to eke outsome kind of sad diasporic existence on a eurasian
satellite pro tour and try to hop those last few competitive plateaux up to show caliber as an adult  or     or you don t know what
you re going to do  and it s often an awful time     
e t a  tries to dilute the awfulness a little by letting eight or nine postgraduates stay on for two years and serve in delint s
platoon of prorec tors     in exchange for room and board and travel expenses to small sad satellite tourneys  and orin s being
directly related to e t a  administration obviously gave him kind of a lock on a prorector appointment if he wanted it  but a
prorector s job was only for maybe at most a few years  and was regarded as sad and purgatorial       and then of course what then 
what are you going to do after that  etc 
orin s decision to attend college pleased his parents a great deal  though mrs  avril incandenza  especially  had gone out of
her way to make it clear that whatever orin decided to do would please them because they stood squarely behind and in full
support of him  orin  and any decision his very best thinking yielded  but they were still in favor of college  privately  you could
tell  orin was clearly not ever going to be a professional caliber adult tennis player  his competitive peak had come at thirteen 
when he d gotten to the    and under quarterfinals of the national clays in indianapolis in and in the quarters had taken a set off
the second seed  but starting soon after that he d suffered athletically from the same delayed puberty that had compromised his
father when himself had been a junior player  and having boys he d cleaned the clocks of at twelve and thirteen become now
seemingly overnight mannish and deep chested and hairy legged and starting now to clean orin s own clock at fourteen and
fifteen   this had sucked some kind of competitive afflatus out of him  broken his tennis spirit  orin  and his u s t a  ranking
had nosedived through three years until it levelled off somewhere in the low   s  which meant that by age fifteen he wasn t even
qualifying for the major events  main    man draw  when e t a  opened  his ranking among the boys    s hovered around    and
he was relegated to a middle spot on the academy s b squad  a mediocrity that sort of becalmed his verve even further  his style
was essentially that of a baseliner  a coun terpuncher  but without the return of serve or passing shots you need to stand much of a
chance against a quality net man  the e t a  rap on orin was that he lobbed well but too often  he did have a phenomenal lob  he
could hug the curve of the dome of the lung and three times out of four nail a large sized coin placed on the opposite baseline  he
and marlon bain and two or three other marginal counterpunching boys at e t a  all had phenomenal lobs  honed through spare
p m  devoted more and more to es chaton  which by the most plausible account a croatian refugee transfer had brought up from
the palmer academy in tampa  orin was eschaton s first game master at e t a   where in the first eschaton generations it was
mostly marginal and deafflatusized upperclassmen who played 
college was the comparatively obvious choice  then  for orin  as the time of decision drew nigh  oblique family pressures
aside  as a low ranked player at e t a  he d had stiffer academic demands than did those for whom the real show had seemed like
a viable goal  and the eschatonology helped a great deal with the math computer stuff e t a  tended to be a bit weak in  both
himself and schtitt being at that point pretty anti quantitative  his grades were solid  his board scores weren t going to embarrass
anybody  orin was basically academically sound  especially for a somebody with a top level competitive sport on his secondary
transcript 
and you have to understand that mediocrity is relative in a sport like junior tennis  a national ranking of    in boys    andunder singles  while mediocre by the standards of aspiring pros  is enough to make most college coaches  chins shiny  orin got a
couple pac    offers  big    offers  u  new mexico actually hired a mariachi band that established itself under his dorm room s
window six nights running until mrs  incandenza got himself to authorize  f  d  v   harde to electrify the fences  ohio state flew
him out to columbus for such a weekend of  prospective orientation  that when orin got back he had to stay in bed for three days
drinking alka seltzer with an ice pack on his groin  cal tech offered him an rotc waiver and a p  standing in their elite
strategic studies program after decade magazine had run a short interest piece on orin and the croate and eschaton s applied use
of c  pink      
orin chose b u  boston u  not a tennis power  not in cal tech s league academically  not the sort of place that hires bands
or flies you out for roman orgies of inducement  and only just about three clicks down the hill and comm  ave  from e t a  
west of the bay  around the intersection of commonwealth and beacon  boston  it was kind of a joint orin incandenza  avril
incandenza decision  orin s moms privately thought it was important for orin to be away from home  psychologically speaking 
but still to be able to come home whenever he wished  she put everything to orin in terms of worrying that her concern over
what d be best for him psychologically might prompt her to overstep her maternal bounds and speak out of turn or give intrusive
advice  according to all her lists and advantage disadvantage charts  b u  was from every angle far and away o  s best choice  but
to keep ever from overstepping or lobbying intrusively the moms actually for six weeks would flee any room orin entered  both
hands clapped over her mouth  orin had this way his face would get when she d beg him not to let her influence his choice  it was
during this period that orin had characterized the moms to hal as a kind of contortionist with other people s bodies  which hal s
never been able to forget  himself  from his own experience  probably thought it d be better for orin to get the hell out of dodge
altogether  do something midwest or pac  but he kept his own counsel  he never had to struggle not to overstep  he probably
figured orin was a big boy  this was four years and    some released entertainments before himself put his head in a microwave
oven  fatally  then it turned out avril s adoptive slash half brother charles tavis  who at this time was back chairing a s a  at
throppinghamshire      turned out to be old minor sport athletic administration network friends with boston university s varsity
tennis coach  tavis flew down special on air canada to set up a meet between the four of them  avril and son and tavis and the
b u  tennis coach  the b u  tennis coach was a septuagenaric ivy league guy  one of those emptily craggily handsome old
patrician men whose profile looks like it ought to be on a coin  who liked his  lads  to wear all white and actually literally vault the
net  win or lose  after matches  b u  had only had a couple nationally ranked players  like ever  and that had been in the a d 
    s  way before this fashion conscious guy s tenure  and when the coach saw orin play he about fell over sideways  recall how
mediocrity is contextual  b u  s players all hailed  literally  from new england country clubs and wore ironed shorts and those
faggy white tennis sweaters with that blood colored stripe across the chest  and talked without moving their jaw  and played the
sort of stiff and patrician serve and volley game you play if you ve had lots of summer lessons and club round robins but had

 never ever had to get out there and kill or die  psychically  orin wore cut off jeans and deck sneakers w o socks and yawned
compulsively as he beat b u  s immaculately groomed  l singles man   and    hitting something like    offensive lobs for
winners  then at the four way meeting tavis arranged  the old b u  coach showed up in l l  bean chinos and a lacoste polo shirt
and got a look at the size of orin s left arm  and then at orin s moms in a tight black skirt and levantine jacket with kohl around
her eyes and a moussed tower of hair and about fell back over sideways the other way  she had this effect on older men 
somehow  orin was in a position to dictate terms limited only by the parameters of b u  s own sports budget mar ginality     
orin signed a letter of intent accepting a full ride to b u   plus books and a hitachi lap top w  software and off campus housing
and living expenses and a lucrative work study job where his job was to turn on the sprinklers every morning at the b u  football
terriers  historic nickerson field  sprinklers that were already on automatic timers   the sprinkler job was b u  s tennis team s
one plum  recruitment wise  charles tavis   who at avril s urging that fall cashed in his canadian return ticket and stayed on as
assistant headmaster to assist orin s father s oversight of the academy     in a progressively more and more total capacity as
both in  and external travels took j  o  incandenza away from enfield more and more often   said    years later that he d never
really expected a thank you from orin anyway  for liaisoning with the b u  tennis apparatus  that he wasn t in this for the thankyous  that a person who did a service for somebody s gratitude was more like a   d cutout image of a person than a bona fide
person  at least that s what he thought  he said  he said what did avril and hal and mario think  was he a genuine   d person  was
he perhaps just rationalizing away some legitimate hurt  did orin maybe resent him for seeming to move in just as he  orin 
moved out  though surely not for tavis s assuming more and more total control of the e t a  helm as j  o  incandenza spent
increasingly long hiati either off with mario on shoots or editing in his room off the tunnel or in alcohol rehabilitative facilities
    of them over those final three years  tavis has the blue cross statements right here   and even more surely not for the final
felo de se anyone with any kind of denial free sensitivity could have predicted for the past    years  but  c t  opined on   july
y d p a h  after orin  who now had plenty of free summer time  declined his fifth straight invitation back to enfield and his
family s annual barbecue and wimbledon finals interlace spontaneous dissemination watching  orin might just be harboring a
resentment over c t  moving into the headmaster s office and changing the door s te occidere pos sunt       before

have someone sedulous and brisk take over  incandenza himself having eliminated his own map on   april of the year of the

and fill the void  and that person was going to have to be someone who could achieve total worry without becoming paralyzed
by the worry or by the absence of minimal thank yous for inglorious duties discharged in the stead of a person whose
replacement was naturally  naturally going to come in for some resentment  tavis felt  since since you can t get mad at a dying
man  much less at a dead man  who better to assume the stress of filling in as anger object than that dead man s thankless
inglorious sedulous untiring   d bureaucratic assistant and replacement  whose own upstairs room was right next to the hmh s
master bedroom and who might  by some grieving parties  be viewed as some kind of interloping usurper  tavis had been ready
for all this stress and more  he told the assembled academy in preparatory remarks before last year s fall term convocation 
speaking through amplification from the red and gray bunting draped crow s nest of gerhardt schtitt s transom down into the
rows of folding chairs arranged all along the base and sidelines of e t a  courts      he not only fully accepted the stress and
resentment  he said he had worked hard and would continue  in his dull quiet unromantic fashion  to work hard to remain open to
it  to this resentment and sense of loss and irreplaceability  even after four years  to let everyone who needed to get it out get it out 
the anger and resentment and possible contempt  for their own psychological health  since tavis acknowledged publicly that there
was more than enough on every e t a  s plate to begin with as it was  the convocation assembly was outside  on the center
courts that in winter are sheltered by the lung  it was    august in the year of dairy products from the american heartland  hot
and muggy  upper classmen who d heard these same basic remarks for the past four years made little razor to jugular and
hangman s noose over imaginary cross beam motions  listening  the sky overhead was glassy blue between clots and strings of
clouds moving swiftly north  on courts       the applied music chorus guys kept up a background of  tenabrae factae sunt

the cotton u s  and crisp nylon o n a n  flags flapped and clanked halfway down the driveway s poles in remembrance  the
sunstrand plaza still as of that fall hadn t yet found a way to muffle its east newton athscme fans  and tavis s voice  which
even with the police bullhorn tended to sound distant and receding anyway  wove in and out of the sound of the fans and the
whump of the e w d  catapults and locusts  electric screams and the exhaust rich hot rush of the summer wind up off comm 
ave  and the car horns and green line s trundle and clang and the clank of the flags  poles and wires  and everybody but the staff
and littlest kids up front missed most of tavis s explanation that salic law d nothing to do with the fact that there was simply no
way the late headmaster s beloved spouse and e t a  dean of academic affairs and of females mrs  avril incandenza could
have become headmaster  how would  headmistress  have sounded  and she had the females and female prorectors and harde s
custodians to oversee  and curricula and assignments and schedules  and complex new o n a n t a  accreditation to finalize the
kafkan application for  plus daily hmh sterilization and personal ablution rituals and the constant battle against anthracnose and
dry climate blight in the dining room s green babies  plus of course e t a  teaching duties on top of that  with the addition of
untold sleepless nights with the militant grammarians of massachusetts  the academic pac that watchdogged media syntax and
invited florid fish lipped guys from the french academy to come speak with trilled r s on prescriptive preservation  and held
marathon multireadings of e g  orwell s  politics and the english language   and whose avril chaired tactical phalanx  mgm s 
was then  unsuccessfully  it turned out  court fighting the new gentle administration s title ii g public funded library phaseoutfat trimming initiative  besides of course being practically laid out flat with grief and having to do all the emotional processing

 work attendant on working through that kind of personal trauma  on top of all of which assuming the administrative tiller of
e t a  itself would have been simply an insupportable burden she s thanked c t  effusively on more than one public occasion for
leaving the plush sinecure of throppinghamshire and coming down to undertake the stress ridden tasks not only of bureaucratic
administration and insuring as smooth a transition as possible but of being there for the incandenza family itself  w  or w o thankyous  and for helping support not only orin s career and institutional decision processes but also for being there supportively for
all involved when orin made his seminal choice not to go ahead and play competitive college tennis after all  at b u 
what happened was that by the third week of his freshman year orin was attempting an extremely unlikely defection from
college tennis to college football  the reason he gave his parents   avril made it clear that the very last thing she wanted was to
have any of her children feel they had to justify or explain to her any sort of abruptly or even bizarrely sudden major decision they
might happen to make  and it s not clear that the mad stork had even nailed down the fact that orin was still in metro boston at
b u  in the first place  but orin still felt the move demanded some kind of explanation   was that fall tennis practice had started
and he d discovered that he was an empty withered psychic husk  competitively  burned out 
orin had been playing  eating  sleeping  and excreting competitive tennis since his racquet was bigger than he was  he said he
realized he had at eighteen become exactly as fine a tennis player as he was ever destined to be  the prospect of further
improvement  a crucial carrot that schtitt and the e t a  staff were expert at dangling  had disappeared at a fourth rate tennis
program whose coach had a poster of bill tilden in his office and offered critique on the level of bend your knees and watch
the ball  this was all actually true  the burn out part  and totally swallowable as far as the from tennis  part went  but orin had a
harder time explaining the decision s  to football component  partly because he had only the vaguest understanding of u s 
football s rules  tactics  and nonmetric venue  he had in fact never once even touched a real pebbled leather football before and 
like most serious tennis players  had always found the misshapen ball s schizoid bounces disorienting and upsetting to look at  in
fact the decision had very little to do with football at all  or with the reason orin ended up starting to give before avril all but
demanded that he stop feeling in any way pressured or compelled to do anything more than ask for their utter and unqualified
support of whatever actions he felt his personal happiness required  which is what she did when he started a slightly lyrical thing
about the crash of pads and sisboomba of pep squad and ambience of male bonding and smell of dewy turf at nickerson field at
dawn when he showed up to watch the sprinklers come on and turn the lemon wedge of risen sun into plumed rainbows of
refraction  the refracting sprinklers part was actually true  and that he liked it  the rest had been fiction 
the real football reason  in all its inevitable real reason banality  was that  over the course of weeks of dawns of watching the
autosprinklers and the pep squad  which really did practice at dawn  practices  orin had developed a horrible schoolboy grade
crush  complete with dilated pupils and weak knees  for a certain big haired sophomore baton twirler he watched twirl and strut
from a distance through the diffracted spectrum of the plumed sprinklers  all the way across the field s dewy turf  a twirler who d
attended a few of the all athletic team mixers orin and his strabismic b u  doubles partner had gone to  and who danced the
same way she twirled and invoked mass pep  which is to say in a way that seemed to turn everything solid in orin s body watery
and distant and oddly refracted 
orin incandenza  who like many children of raging alcoholics and ocd sufferers had internal addictive sexuality issues  had
already drawn idle little sideways   s on the postcoital flanks of a dozen b u  coeds  but this was different  he d been smitten
before  but not decapitated  he lay on his bed in the autumn p m s during the tennis coach s required nap time  squeezing a tennis
ball and talking for hours about this twirling sprinkler obscured sophomore while his doubles partner lay way on the other side of
the huge bed looking simultaneously at orin and at the n e  leaves changing color in the trees outside the window  the schoolboy
epithet they d made up to refer to orin s twirler was the p g o a t   for the prettiest girl of all time  it wasn t the entire
attraction  but she really was almost grotesquely lovely  she made the moms look like the sort of piece of fruit you think you want
to take out of the bin and but then once you re right there over the bin you put back because from close up you can see a much
fresher and less preserved seeming piece of fruit elsewhere in the bin  the twirler was so pretty that not even the senior b u 
football terriers could summon the saliva to speak to her at athletic mixers  in fact she was almost universally shunned  the
twirler induced in heterosexual males what u h i d  later told her was termed the actaeon complex  which is a kind of deep
phylogenic fear of transhuman beauty  about all orin s doubles partner   who as a strabismic was something of an expert on
female unattain ability   felt he could do was warn o  that this was the kind of hideously attractive girl you just knew in advance
did not associate with normal collegiate human males  and clearly attended b u  athletic social functions only out of a sort of
bland scientific interest while she waited for the cleft chinned ascapartic male model looking wildly successful in business adult
male she doubtless was involved with to telephone her from the back seat of his green stretch infiniti  etc  no major sport player
had ever even orbited in close enough to hear the elisions and apical lapses of a mid southern accent in her oddly flat but resonant
voice that sounded like someone enunciating very carefully inside a soundproof enclosure  when she danced  at dances  it was
with other cheerleaders and twirlers and pep squad terrierettes  because no male had the grit or spit to ask her  orin himself
couldn t get closer than four meters at parties  because he suddenly couldn t figure out where to put the stresses in the charlestavis unwittingly inspired
 describe the sort of man you find attractive and ril affect the demeanor of that sort of man 
strategic opening that had worked so well on other b u  subjects  it took three hearings for him to figure out that her name wasn t
joel  the big hair was red gold and the skin peachy tinged pale and arms freckled and zy gomatics indescribable and her eyes an
extra natural hd green  he wouldn t learn till later that the almost pungently clean line dried laundry scent that hung about her
was a special low ph dandelion attar decocted special by her chemist daddy in shiny prize ky 
boston university s tennis team  needless to say  had neither cheerleaders nor baton twirling pep squads  which were
reserved for major and large crowd sports  this is pretty understandable 
the tennis coach took orin s decision hard  and orin had had to hand him a kleenex and stand there for several minutes under
the poster of an avuncular big bill tilden standing there in wwii era long white pants and ruffling a ballboy s hair  orin
watching the kleenex soggify and get holes blown through it while he tried to articulate just what he meant by burned out and
withered husk and carrot  the coach had kept asking if this meant orin s mother wouldn t be coming down to watch practice
anymore 
orin s now former doubles partner  a strabismic and faggy sweatered but basically decent guy who also happened to be heir

 to the nickerson farms meat facsmile fortune  had his cleft chinned and solidly b u  connected dad make  a couple quick calls 
from the back seat of his forest green lexus  b u  s head football coach  the boss terrier  an exiled oklahoman who really did
wear a gray crewneck sweatshirt with a whistle on a string  was intrigued by the size of the left forearm and hand extended
 impolitely but intriguingly  during introductions   this was orin s tennis arm  roughly churn sized  the other  whose dimensions
were human  was hidden under a sportcoat draped strategically over the aspiring walk on s right shoulder 
but you can t play u s  football with a draped sportcoat  and orin s only real speed was in tiny three meter lateral bursts  and
then it turned out that the idea of actually making direct physical contact with an opponent was so deeply ingrained as alien and
horrific that orin s tryouts  even at reserve positions  were too pathetic to describe  he was called a dragass and then a mollygag
and then a bona fried pussy  he was finally told that he seemed to have some kind of empty swinging sack where his balls ought
to be and that if he wanted to keep his scholarship he might ought to stick to minor type sports where what you hit didn t up and
hit you back  the coach finally actually grabbed orin s facemask and pointed to the mouth of the field s southern tunnel  orin
walked south off the field solo and disconsolate  helmet under his little right arm  with not even a wistful glance back at the pep
squad s p g o a t  practicing baton aloft splits in a heart rendingly distant way beneath the visitors  northern goalposts 
what metro boston aas are trite but correct about is that both destiny s kisses and its dope slaps illustrate an individual
person s basic personal powerlessness over the really meaningful events in his life        i e  almost nothing important that ever
happens to you happens because you engineer it  destiny has no beeper  destiny always leans trenchcoated out of an alley with
some sort of psst that you usually can t even hear because you re in such a rush to or from something important you ve tried to
engineer  the destiny grade event that happened to orin incandenza at this point was that just as he was passing glumly under the
home goalposts and entering the shadow of the south exit tunnel s adit a loud and ominously orthopedic cracking sound  plus then
shrieking  issued from somewhere on the field behind him  what had happened was that b u  s best defensive tackle   a     kilo
future pro who had no teeth and liked to color   practicing special teams punt rushes  not only blocked b u  s varsity punter s
kick but committed a serious mental error and kept coming and crashed into the little padless guy while the punter s cleated foot
was still up over his head  falling on him in a beefy heap and snapping everything from femur to tarsus in the punter s leg with a
dreadful high caliber snap  two pep majorettes and a waterboy fainted from the sound of the punter s screams alone  the blocked
punt s ball caromed hard off the defensive tackle s helmet and bounced crazily and rolled untended all the way back to the shadow
of the south tunnel  where orin had turned to watch the punter writhe and the lineman rise with a finger in his mouth and a guilty
expression  the defensive line coach disconnected his headset and dashed out and began blowing his whistle at the lineman at
extremely close range  over and over  as the huge tackle started to cry and hit himself in the forehead with the heel of his hand 
since nobody else was close  orin picked up the blocked punt s ball  which the head coach was gesturing impatiently for from his
position at the midfield bench  orin held the football  which he d not been very good at it during tryouts  holding onto it   feeling
its weird oval weight  and looked way upfield at the stretcher bearers and punter and assistants and coach  it was too far to try to
throw  and there was just no way orin was making another solo walk up the sideline and then back off the field again under the
distant green gaze of the twirler who owned his cns 
orin  before that seminal moment  had never tried to kick any sort of ball before in his whole life  was the unengineered and
kind of vulnerable revelation that ended up moving joelle van dyne way more than status or hang time 
and but as of that moment  as whistles fell from lips and people pointed  and under that same green and sprinkler hazed gaze
orin found for himself  within competitive u s  football  a new niche and carrot  a show type career he could never have
dreamed of trying to engineer  within days he was punting    yards without a rush  practicing solo on an outside field with the
special teams assistant  a dreamy gauloise smoking man who invoked ideas of sky and flight and called orin  ephebe   which a
discreet phone call to his youngest brother revealed not to be the insult orin had feared it sounded like  by the second week o 
was up around    yards  still without a snap or rush  his rhythm clean and faultless  his concentration on the transaction between
one foot and one leather egg almost frighteningly total  nor  by the third week  was he much distracted by the ten crazed pituitary
giants bearing down as he took the snap and stepped forward  the gasps and crunching and meaty splats of interpersonal contact
around him  the cooly type shuffle of the stretcher bearers who came and went after the whistles blew  he d been taken aside and
the empty scrotum crack apologized for  and it had been explained   complete with blow ups of rulebook pages   that
regulations against direct physical contact with the punter were draconian  enforced by the threat of massive yardage and loss of
possession  the rifle shot sounds of the ex punter s now useless leg were one in a million sounds  he was assured  the head
coach let orin overhear him telling the defense that any man misfortunate enough to impact the team s new stellar punt man
might could just keep on walking after the play was over  all the way to the south tunnel and the stadium exit and the nearest
transportation to some other institution of learning and ball 
it was  pretty obviously  the start of football season  crisp air  everything half dead  burning leaves  hot chocolate  raccoon
coats and halftime twirling and something called the wave  crowds exponentially larger and more demonstrative than tennistournament crowds  home v  suny buffalo  home v  syracuse  at boston college  at rhode island  home v  the despised
minutemen of umass amherst  orin s average reached    yards per kick and was still improving  his eyes fixed on the twin
inducements of a gleaming baton and a massive developmental carrot he hadn t felt since age fourteen  he punted the football
better and better as his motion   a dancerly combination of moves and weight transfers every bit as complex and precise as a
kick serve   got more instinctive and he found his hamstrings and adductors loosening through constant and high impact
competitive punting  his left cleat finishing at     to the turf  knee to his nose  rockette kicking in the midst of crowd noise so
rabid and entire it seemed to remove stadiums  air  the one huge wordless orgasmic voice rising and creating a vacuum that sucked
the ball after it into the sky  the leather egg receding as it climbed in a perfect spiral  seeming to chase the very crowd roar it had
produced 
by halloween his control was even better than his distance  it wasn t by accident that the special teams assistant described it
as  touch   consider that a football field is basically just a grass tennis court tugged unnaturally long  and that white lines at
complex right angles still define tactics and movement  the very possibility of play  and that orin incandenza  who tennishistorically had had mediocre passing shots  had been indicted by schtitt for depending way too often on the lob he d developed as
compensation  like the equally weak passing eschaton prodigy michael pemulis after him  orin s whole limited game had been

 built around a preternatural lob  which of course a lob is just a higher than opponent parabola that ideally lands just shy of the
area of play s rear boundary and is hard to retrieve and return  gerhardt schtitt and delint and their depressed prorectors had had
to sit eating butterless popcorn through only one cartridge of one b u  game to understand how orin had found his major sport
niche  orin was still just only lobbing  schtitt observed  illustrating with the pointer and a multiple replayed fourth down  but now
with the leg instead  the only punting  and now with ten armored and testosterone flushed factota to deal with what ever return an
opponent could muster  schtitt posited that orin had stumbled by accident on a way  in this grotesquely physical and territorial
u s  game  to legitimate the same dependency on the one shot of lob that had kept him from developing the courage to develop his
weaker areas  which this unwillingness to risk the temporary failure and weakness for long term gaining had been the real
herbicide on the carrot of orin incandenza s tennis  puberty schmuberty  as the real reason for burning down the inside fire for
tennis  schtitt knew  schtitt s remarks were nodded vigorously at and largely ignored  in the viewing room  schtitt later told
delint he had several very bad feelings about orin s future  inside 
but so by freshman halloween orin was regularly placing his punts inside the opponents      spinning the ball off his cleats 
laces so it either hit and squiggled outside the white sideline and out of play or else landed on its point and bounced straight up
and seemed to squat in the air  hovering and spinning  waiting for some downfield terrier to kill it just by touching  the special
teams assistant told orin that these were historically called coffin corner kicks  and that orin incandenza was the best natural
coffin corner man he d lived to see  you almost had to smile  orin s full ride scholarship was renewed under the aegis of a
brutaler but way more popular north american sport than competitive tennis  this was after the second home game  around the
time that a certain actaeonizingly pretty baton twirler  invoking mass pep during breaks in the action  seemed to begin somehow
directing her glittering sideline routines at orin in particular  so and then the only really cardiac grade romantic relationship of
orin s life took bilateral root at a distance  during games  without one exchanged personal phoneme  a love communicated  
across grassy expanses  against stadiums  monovocal roar   entirely through stylized repetitive motions   his functional  hers
celebratory   their respective little dances of devotion to the spectacle they were both   in their different roles   trying to make
as entertaining as possible 
but so the point was that the accuracy came after the distance  in his first couple games orin had approached his fourth down
task as one of simply kicking the ball out of sight and past hope of return  the dreamy s t  assistant said this was a punter s
natural pattern of growth and development  your raw force tends to precede your control  in his initial home start  wearing a
padless uniform that didn t fit and a wide receiver s number  he was summoned when b u  s first drive stalled on the    of a
syracuse team that had no idea it was in its last season of representing an american university  a side issue  college sport
analysts would later use the game to contrast the beginning and end of different eras  but a side issue  orin had a book long of   
yards that day  and an average hang of eight point something seconds  but that first official punt  exhilarated   the carrot  the
p g o a t   the monovocal roar of a major sport crowd   he sent over the head of the orangeman back waiting to receive it  over
the goalposts and the safety nets behind the goalposts  over the first three sections of seats and into the lap of an emeritus
theology prof in row    who d needed opera glasses to make out the play itself  it went in the books at    yards  that baptismal
competitive punt  it was really almost a    yard punt  and had the sort of hang time the special teams asst  said you could have
tender and sensitive intercourse during  the sound of the podiatric impact had silenced a major sport crowd  and a retired usmc
flier who always came with petroleum jelly samples he hawked to the knuckle chapped crowds in the nickerson stands told his
cronies in a brookline watering hole after the game that this incandenza kid s first public punt had sounded just the way rolling
thunder s big bellied berthas had sounded  the exaggerated whump of incendiary tonnage  way larger than life 
after four weeks  orin s success at kicking big egg shaped balls was way past anything he d accomplished hitting little round
ones  granted  the tennis and eschaton hadn t hurt  but it wasn t all athletic  this affinity for the public punt  it wasn t all just highlevel competitive training and high pressure experience transported inter sport  he told joelle van dyne  she of the accent and
baton and brainlocking beauty  told her in the course of an increasingly revealing conversation after kind of amazingly she had
approached him at a columbus day major sport function and asked him to autograph a squooshy sided football he d kicked a hole
through in practice   the deflated bladder had landed in the marching terriers  sousaphone player s sousaphone and had been
handed over to joelle after extrication by the lardy tubist  sweaty and dumb under the girl s ac taeonizingly imploring gaze  
asked him   orin now also suddenly damp and blank on anything attractive to say or recite   asked him in an emptily resonant
drawl to inscribe the punctured thing for her own personal daddy  one joe lon van dyne of shiny prize ky and she said also of
the dyne riney proton donor reagent corp  of nearby boaz ky  and engaged him  o   in a slowly decreasingly one sided
social function type conversation   the p g o a t  was pretty easy to stay in a one to one like tete a tete with  since no other
terrier could bring himself within four meters of her   and orin gradually found himself almost meeting her eye as he shared
that he believed it wasn t all athletic  punting s pull for him  that a lot of it seemed emotional and or even  if there was such a thing
anymore  spiritual  a denial of silence  here were upwards of        voices  souls  voicing approval as one soul  he invoked the
raw numbers  the frenzy  he was thinking out loud here  audience exhortations and approvals so total they ceased to be
numerically distinct and melded into a sort of single coital moan  one big vowel  the sound of the womb  the roar gathering  tidal 
amniotic  the voice of what might as well be god  none of tennis s prim applause cut short by an umpire s patrician shush  he said
he was just speculating here  ad libbing  he was meeting her eye and not drowning  his dread now transformed into whatever it
had been dread of  he said the sound of all those souls as one sound  too loud to bear  building  waiting for his foot to release it 
orin said the thing he thought he liked was he literally could not hear himself think out there  maybe a cliche  but out there transformed  his own self transcended as he d never escaped himself on the court  a sense of a presence in the sky  the crowd sound
congregational  the stadium shaking climax as the ball climbed and inscribed a cathedran arch  seeming to take forever to fall      it
never even occurred to him to ask her what sort of demeanor she preferred  he didn t have to strategize or even scheme  later he
knew what the dread had been dread of  he hadn t had to promise her anything  it turned out  it was all for free 
by the end of his freshman fall and b u  s championship of the yankee conference  plus its nonvictorious but still
unprecedented appearance at las vegas s dignitary attended k l rmki forsythia bowl  orin had taken his off campus housing
subsidy and moved with joelle van dyne the heart stopping kentuckian into an east cambridge co op three subway stops distant
from b u  and the all new inconveniences of being publicly stellar at a major sport in a city where people beat each other to death

 in bars over stats and fealty 
joelle had done the midnight thanksgiving dinner at e t a   and survived avril  and then orin spent his first xmas ever
away from home  flying to paducah and then driving a rented  wd to kudzu hung shiny prize  kentucky  to drink toddies under a
little white reusable xmas tree with all red balls with joelle and her mother and personal daddy and his loyal pointers  getting a
storm cellar tour of joe lon s incredible pyrex collection of every solution in the known world that can turn blue litmus paper red 
little red rectangles floating in the flasks for proof  orin nodding a lot and trying incredibly hard and joelle saying that mr  van
d  s not once smiling at him was just his way  was all  the way his own moms had her way joelle d had trouble with  orin wired
marlon bain and ross real and the strabismic nickerson that he was by all indications in love with somebody 
freshman new year s eve in shiny prize  far from the o n a n ite upheavals of the new northeast  the last p m  before
subsidization  was the first time orin saw joelle ingest very small amounts of cocaine  orin had exited his own substance phase
about the time he discovered sex  plus of course the n  o n a n c a a  urine considerations  and he declined it  the cocaine  but
not in a judgmental or killjoy way  and found he liked being with his p g o a t  straight while she ingested  he found it exciting 
a vicariously on the edge feeling he associated with giving yourself not to any one game s definition but to yourself and how you
unjudgmentally feel about somebody who s high and feeling even freer and better than normal  with you  alone  under the red
balls  they were a natural match here  her ingestion then was recreational  and he not only didn t mind but never made a show of
not minding  nor she that he abstained  the whole substance issue was natural and kind of free  another reason they seemed starfated was that joelle had in her sophomore year decided to concentrate in film cartridge  academically  at b u  either filmcartridge theory or film cartridge production  or maybe both  the p g o a t  was a film fanatic  though her tastes were pretty
corporate  she told o  she preferred movies where  a whole bunch of shit blows up         orinina low key way introduced her to
art film  conceptual and highbrow academic avant  and apres garde film  and taught her how to use some of interlace s more
esoteric menus  he blasted up the hill to enfield and brought down the mad stork s own pre nuptial agreement of heaven and
hell  which had a major impact on her  right after thanksgiving himself let the p g o a t  understudy with leith on the set of
the american century as seen through a brick in return for getting to film her thumb against a plucked string  after an only
mildly disappointing sophomore season o  flew with her to toronto to watch part of the filming of blood sister  one tough nun 
himself would take orin and his beloved out after dailies  entertaining joelle with his freakish gift for canadian cab hailing while
orin stood turtle headed in his topcoat  and then later orin would shepherd the two of them back to their ontario place hotel 
stopping the cab to let them both throw up  fireman carrying joelle while he watched the mad stork negotiate his suite by
holding on to walls  himself showed them the u  toronto conference center where he and the moms had first met  this might
have been the end s start  gradually  in hindsight  joelle that summer declined a sixth summer at the dixie baton twirling institute
in oxford ms and let himself give her a stage name and use her in rapid succession in low temperature civics   the  desire to
desire  and safe boating is no accident  travelling with himself and mario while orin stayed in boston recuperating from minor
surgery on a hypertrophied left quadriceps at a massachusetts general hospital where no fewer than four nurses and p t s in the
sports medicine wing filed for legal separation from their husbands  with custody 
the p g o a t  s real ambitions weren t thespian  orin knew  is one reason he hung in so long  joelle when he d met her
already owned some modest personal film equipment  courtesy of her personal daddy  and she now had access to nothing if not
serious digital gear  by orin s sophomore year she no longer twirled or incited pep in any way  in his first full season she stood
behind various white lines with a little bolex r   digital recorder and btl meters and lenses  including a bitching angenieux
zoom o  d gone and paid for  as a gesture  and she shot little half disk sector clips of      b u  punter  sometimes with leith in
attendance  never himself   experimenting with speed and focal length and digital mattes  extending herself technically  orin 
despite his interests in upgrading the p g o a t  s commercial tastes  was himself pretty luke warm on film and cartridges and
theater and pretty much anything that reduced him to herd like spectation  but he respected joelle s own creative drives  to an
extent  and he found out that he really did like watching the football footage of joelle van dyne  featuring pretty much him only 
strongly preferred the little    sector clips to himself s cartridges or corporate films where things blew up while joelle bounced in
her seat and pointed at the viewer  and he found them  her clips of him at play  way more engaging than the grainy overcluttered
game  and play celluloids the head coach made everybody sit through  orin liked to adjust the co op s rheostat way down when
joelle wasn t home and haul out the diskettes and make jiffy pop and watch her little ten second clips of him over and over  he
saw something different each time he rewound  something more  the clips of him punting unfolded like time lapsing flowers and
seemed to reveal him in ways he could never have engineered  he sat rapt  it only happened when he watched them alone 
sometimes he got an erection  he never masturbated  joelle came home  still in the last stages of a late puberty and the prettiness
getting visibly worse day by day  joelle had been maiden  still  when orin met her  she d been shunned theretofore  both at b u 
and shiny prize boaz consolidated  the beauty had repelled every comer  she d devoted her life to her twirling and amateur film 
disney leith said she had the knack  her camera hand was rock steady  even the early clips from the start of the y w  season
looked shot off a tripod  there d been no audio in the sophomore clips  and you could hear the high pitched noise of the cartridge
in the tp s disk drive  a cartridge revolving at a digital diskette s     rpm sounds a bit like a distant vacuum cleaner  late night
car noises and sirens drifted in through the bars from as far away as the storrow      silence was not part of what orin was after 
watching   joelle housekeeps like a fiend  the place is always sterile  the resemblance to the moms s housekeeping he finds a bit
creepy  except joelle doesn t mind a mess or give anybody the creeps worrying about hiding that she minds it so nobody s feelings
will be hurt  with joelle the mess just disappears sometime during the night and you wake up and the place is sterile  it s like
elves   soon after he started watching the clips in his junior year  orin had blasted up comm  s hill and brought joelle back a
bolex compatible tatsuoka recorder w  sync pulse  a cardioid mike  a low end tripod w  a barney to muffle the bolex s whir  a
classy pilotone blooper and sync pulse cords  a whole auracopia  it took leith three weeks to teach her to use the pilotone  now
the clips had sound  orin has trouble not burning the jiffy pop popcorn  it tends to burn as the foil top inflates  you have to take it
off the stove before the foil forms a dome  no microwave popcorn for orin  even then  he liked to dim the track lights when
joelle was out and haul out the cartridge rack and watch her little ten second clips of his punts over and over  here he is back
against delaware in the second home game of y t m p  the sky is dull and pale  the five yankee conference flags   u 
vermont and unh now history   are all right out straight with the gale off the charles for which nickerson field is infamous 

 it s fourth down  obviously  thousands of kilos of padded meat assume four point stances and chuff at each other  poised to
charge and stave  orin is twelve yards back from scrimmage  his cleated feet together  his weight just ahead of himself  his
mismatched arms out before him in the attitude of the blind before walls  his eyes are fixed on the distant grass stained valentine
of the center s ass  his stance  waiting to receive the snap  is not unlike a diver s  he sees  nine men on line  four pointed  poised to
stave off ten men s assault  the other team s deep back is back to receive  seventy yards away or more  the fullback whose sole
job is to keep orin from harm is ahead and to the left  bent at the knees  his taped fists together and elbows out like a winged thing
ready to hurl itself at whatever breaches the line and comes at the punter  joelle s equipment isn t quite pro caliber but her
technique is very good  by junior year there s also color  there s only one sound  and it is utter  the crowd s noise and its response
to that noise  building  orin s back against delaware  ready  his helmet a bright noncontact white and his head s insides scrubbed
free for ten seconds of every thought not connected to receiving the long snap and stepping martially forward to lob the leather
egg beyond sight at an altitude that makes the wind no factor  madame p g o a t  gets it all  zooming in from the opposite end
zone  she gets his timing  a punt s timing is minutely precise  like a serve s  it s like a solo dance  she gets the ungodly whump
against and above the crowd s vowel s climax  she captures the pendular     arc of orin s leg  the gluteal follow through that puts
his cleat s laces way over his helmet  the perfect right angle between leg and turf  her technique is superb on the delaware debacle
orin can just barely take reviewing  the one time all year the big chuffing center oversnaps and arcs the ball over orin s upraised
hands so by the time he s run back and grabbed the crazy bouncing thing ten yards farther back the delaware defense has
breached the line  are through the line  the fullback supine and trampled  all ten rushers rushing  wanting nothing more than
personal physical contact with orin and his leather egg  joelle gets him sprinting  a three meter lateral burst as he avoids the first
few sets of hands and the beefy curling lips and but is just about to get personally contacted and knocked out of his cleats by the
delaware strong safety flying in on a slant from way outside when the tiny    sector of digital space each punt s programmed to
require runs out and the crowd sound moos and dies and you can hear the disk drive stalled at the terminal byte and orin s chinstrapped plastic barred face is there on the giant viewer  frozen and high def in his helmet  right before impact  zoomed in on
with a quality lens  of particular interest are the eyes 

   november year of the depend adult undergarment
poor tony krause had a seizure on the t  it happened on a gray line train from watertown to inman square  cambridge 
he d been drinking codeine cough syrup in the men s room of the armenian foundation library in horrid central watertown ma
for over a week  darting out from cover only to beg a scrip from hideous equus reese and then dash in at brooks pharmacy 
wearing a simply vile ensemble of synthetic fiber slacks and suspenders and tweed donegal cap he d had to cadge from a
longshoremen s union hall  poor tony couldn t dare wear anything comely  not even the antitoi brothers  red leather coat  not
since that poor woman s bag had turned out to have a heart inside  he had simply never felt so beset and overcome on all sides as
the black july day when it fell to his lot to boost a heart  who wouldn t wonder why me  he didn t dare dress expressive or ever
go back to the square  and emil still had him marked for de mapping as a consequence of that horrid thing with wo and bobby c
last winter  poor tony hadn t dared show one feather east of tremont st  or at the brighton projects or even delphina s in
backwater enfield since last xmas  even after emil simply dematerialized from the street scene  and now since    july he was
non grata at harvard square and environs  and even the sight of an oriental now gave him palpitations   say nothing of an
aigner accessory 
thus poor tony had no way to cop for himself  he could trust no one enough to inject their wares  s  t  cheese and
lolasister were no more trustworthy than he himself  he didn t even want them to know where he slept  he began drinking cough
syrup  he managed to get bridget tender hole and the strictly rough trade stokely dark star to cop for him on the wink for a few
weeks  until stokely died in a fenway hospice and then bridget ten derhole was shipped by her pimp to brockton under
maddeningly vague circumstances  then poor tony had read the dark portents and swallowed the first of his pride and hid himself
even more deeply in a dumpster complex behind the i b p w d w        local    hall in fort point downtown and resolved to
stay hidden there for as long as he could swallow the pride to send lolasister out to acquire heroin  accepting w o pride or complaint the shameless rip offs the miserable bitch perpetrated upon him  until a period in october when lolasister went down with
hepatitis g and the supply of heroin dried horribly up and the only people even copping enough to chip were people in a position
to dash here and there to great beastly lengths under an open public access sky and no friend  no matter how dear or indebted 
could afford to cop for another  then  wholly friend  and connectionless  poor tony  in hiding  began to withdraw from heroin 
not just get strung out or sick  withdraw  the words echoed in his neuralgiac and wigless head with the simply most awful
sinister footsteps echoing in deserted corridor quality  withdrawal  the wingless fowl  turkeyfication  kicking  the old cold
bird  poor tony had never once had to withdraw  not all the way down the deserted corridor of withdrawal  not since he first got
strung at seventeen  at the very worst  someone kind had always found him charming  if things got dire enough to have to rent out
his charms  alas thus about the fact that his charms were now at low ebb  he weighed fifty kilos and his skin was the color of
summer squash  he had terrible shivering attacks and also perspired  he had a sty that had scraped one eyeball as pink as a
bunny s  his nose ran like twin spigots and the output had a yellow green tinge he didn t think looked promising at all  there was
an uncomely dry rot smell about him that even he could smell  in water town he tried to pawn his fine auburn wig w  removable
chignon and was cursed at in armenian because the wig had infestations from his own hair below  let s not even mention the
armenian pawnbroker s critique of his red leather coat 
poor tony got more and more ill as he further withdrew  his symptoms themselves developed symptoms  troughs and nodes
he charted with morbid attention in the dumpster  in his suspenders and horrid tweed cap  clutching a shopping bag with his wig
and coat and comely habilements he could neither wear nor pawn  the empty empire displacement co  dumpster he was hiding
in was new and apple green and the inside was bare dimpled iron  and it remained new and unutilized because persons declined to
come near enough to utilize it  it took some time for poor tony to realize why this was so  for a brief interval it had seemed like a
break  fortune s one wan smile  an e w d  land barge crew set him straight in language that left quite a bit of tact to be wished
for  he felt  the dumpster s green iron cover also leaked when it rained  and it contained already a colony of ants along one wall 

 which insects poor tony had ever since a neurasthenic childhood feared and detested in particular  ants  and in direct sunlight the
quarters became a hellish living environment from which even the ants seemed to vanish 
with each step further into the black corridor of actual withdrawal  poor tony krause stamped his foot and simply refused to
believe things could feel any worse  then he stopped being able to anticipate when he needed to as it were visit the powder room 
a fastidious gender dysphoric s horror of incontinence cannot properly be described  fluids of varying consistency began to pour
w o advance notice from several openings  then of course they stayed there  the fluids  on the summer dumpster s iron floor 
there they were  not going anywhere  he had no way to clean up and no way to cop  his entire set of interpersonal associations
consisted of persons who did not care about him plus persons who wished him harm  his own late obstetrician father had rended
his own clothing in symbolic shiva in the year of the whopper in the kitchen of the krause home      mount auburn street 
horrid central watertown  it was the incontinence plus the prospect of      s monthly social assistance checks that drove poor
tony out for a mad scampering relocation to an obscure armenian foundation library men s room in watertown center  wherein
he tried to arrange a stall as comfortingly as he could with shiny magazine photos and cherished knickknacks and toilet paper laid
down around the seat  and flushed repeatedly  and tried to keep true withdrawal at some sort of bay with bottles of codinex plus 
a tiny percentage of codeine gets metabolized into good old c   morphine  affording an agonizing hint of what real relief from
the bird might feel like  i e  the cough syrup did little more than draw the process out  extend the corridor   it slowed up time 
poor tony krause sat on the insulated toilet in the domesticated stall all day and night  alternately swilling and gushing  he
held his high heels up at   ooh  when the library staff checked the stalls and turned off all the lights and left poor tony in a
darkness within darkness so utter he had no idea where his own limbs were or went  he left that stall maybe once every two days 
scampering madly to brooks in cast off shades and a kind of hood or shawl made pathetically of brown men s room paper towels 
time began to take on new aspects for him  now  as withdrawal progressed  time began to pass with sharp edges  its passage
in the dark or dim lit stall was like time was being carried by a procession of ants  a gleaming red martial column of those
militaristic red southern u s  ants that build hideous tall boiling hills  and each vile gleaming ant wanted a minuscule little
portion of poor tony s flesh in compensation as it helped bear time slowly forward down the corridor of true withdrawal  by the
second week in the stall time itself seemed the corridor  lightless at either end  after more time time then ceased to move or be
moved or be move throughable and assumed a shape above and apart  a huge  musty feathered  orange eyed wingless fowl
hunched incontinent atop the stall  with a kind of watchful but deeply uncaring personality that didn t seem keen on poor tony
krause as a person at all  or to wish him well  not one little bit  it spoke to him from atop the stall  the same things  over and over 
they were unrepeatable  nothing in even poor tony s grim life experience prepared him for the experience of time with a shape
and an odor  squatting  and the worsening physical symptoms were a spree at bonwit s compared to time s black assurances that
the symptoms were merely hints  signposts pointing up at a larger  far more dire set of withdrawal phenomena that hung just
overhead by a string that unravelled steadily with the passage of time  it would not keep still and would not end  it changed shape
and smell  it moved in and out of him like the very most feared prison shower assailant  poor tony had once had the hubris to
fancy he d had occasion really to shiver  ever  before  but he had never truly really shivered until time s cadences   jagged and
cold and smelling oddly of deodorant   entered his body via several openings   cold the way only damp cold is cold   the
phrase he d had the gall to have imagined he understood was the phrase chilled to the bone   shard studded columns of chill
entering to fill his bones with ground glass  and he could hear his joints  glassy crunch with every slightest shift of hunched
position  time ambient and in the air and entering and exiting at will  coldly  and the pain of his breath against his teeth  time
came to him in the falcon black of the library night in an orange mohawk and merry widow w  tacky amalfo pumps and nothing
else  time spread him and entered him roughly and had its way and left him again in the form of endless gushing liquid shit that
he could not flush enough to keep up with  he spent the longest morbid time trying to fathom whence all the shit came from when
he was ingesting nothing at all but codinex plus  then at some point he realized  time had become the shit itself  poor tony had
become an hourglass  time moved through him now  he ceased to exist apart from its jagged edged flow  he now weighed more
like    kg  his legs were the size his comely arms had been  before withdrawal  he was haunted by the word zuckung  a foreign
and possibly yiddish word he did not recall ever before hearing  the word kept echoing in quick step cadence through his head
without meaning anything  he d naively assumed that going mad meant you were not aware of going mad  he d naively pictured
madmen as forever laughing  he kept seeing his sonless father again   removing the training wheels  looking at his pager 
wearing a green gown and mask  pouring iced tea in a pebbled glass  tearing his sportshirt in filial woe  grabbing his shoulder 
sinking to his knees  stiffening in a bronze casket  being lowered under the snow at mount auburn cemetery  through dark
glasses from a distance   chilled to the zuckung   when  then  even the funds for the codeine syrup were exhausted  he still sat on
the toilet of the rear stall of the a f l  loo  surrounded by previously comforting hung habilements and fashion magazine
photographs he d fastened to the wall with tape cadged on the way in from the reference desk  sat for almost a whole nother night
and day  because he had no faith that he could stem the flow of diarrhea long enough to make it anywhere   if anywhere to go
presented itself   in his only pair of gender appropriate slacks  during hours of lit operation  the men s room was full of old men
who wore identical brown loafers and spoke slavic and whose rapid fire flatulence smelled of cabbage 
toward the end of the day of the second syrupless afternoon  the day of the seizure  poor tony krause began to withdraw
from the cough syrup s alcohol and codeine and demethylated morphine  now  as well as from the original heroin  yielding a set of
sensations for which not even his recent experience had prepared him  the alcohol withdrawal especially   and when the true
d t  type big budget visuals commenced  when the first glossy and minutely hirsute army ant crawled up his arm and refused
ghostlike to be brushed away or hammered dead  poor tony threw his hygienic pride into time s porcelain maw and pulled up his
slacks   mortifyingly wrinkled from     days puddled around his ankles   made what slight cosmetic repairs he could  donned
his tacky hat with scotch taped scarf of paper towels  and lit out in last ditch desperation for cambridge s inman square  for the
sinister and duplicitous antitoi brothers  their glass entertainment  n notions fronted operations center he d long ago vowed
never again to darken the door of and but now figured to be his place of very last resort  the antitois  canadians of the quebec
subgenus  sinister and duplicitous but when it came down to it rather hapless political insurgents he d twice availed of services
through the offices of lolasister  now the only persons anywhere he could claim somehow owed him a kindness  since the affair
of the heart 

 in his coat and skallycap over scarf on watertown center s underground gray line platform  when the first hot loose load fell
out into the baggy slacks and down his leg and out around his high heel   he still had only his red high heels with the crossing
straps  which the slacks were long enough to mostly hide   poor tony closed his eyes against the ants formicating up and down
his arms  skinny length and screamed a soundless interior scream of utter and soul scalded woe  his beloved boa fit almost
entirely in one breast pocket  where it stayed in the name of discretion  on the crowded train itself  then  he discovered that he d
gone in three weeks from being a colorful and comely albeit freakishly comely person to being one of those loathsome urban
specimens that respectable persons on t trains slide and drift quietly away from without even seeming to notice they re even there 
his scarf of paper towels had come partly untaped  he smelled of bilirubin and yellow sweat and wore week old eyeliner that
simply did not fly if one needed a shave  there had been some negative urine incidents as well  in the slacks  to round matters out 
he had simply never in his life felt so unattractive or been so sick  he wept silently in shame and pain at the passage of each
brightly lit public second s edge  and the driver ants that boiled in his lap opened needle teethed little insectile mouths to catch the
tears  he could feel his erratic pulse in his sty  the gray line was of the green  and orange line trundling behemoth type train 
and he sat all alone at one end of the car  feeling each slow second take its cut 
when it descended  the seizure felt less like a separate distinct health crisis than simply the next exhibit in the corridor of
horrors that was the old cold bird  in actual fact the seizure   a kind of synaptic firefight in poor tony s desiccated temporal
lobes   was caused entirely by withdrawal not from heroin but from plain old grain alcohol  which was co dinex plus cough
syrup s primary ingredient and balm  he d consumed upwards of sixteen little eighty proof bottles of codinex per day for eight
days  and so was cruising for a real neurochemical bruising when he just up and stopped  the first thing that didn t augur very well
was a shower of spark sized phosphenes from the ceiling of the swaying train  this plus the fiery violet aura around the heads of
the respectables who d quietly retreated as far as possible from the various puddles in which he sat  their clean pink faces looked
somehow stricken  each inside a hood of violet flame  poor tony didn t know that his silent whimpers had ceased to be silent  was
why everyone in the car had gotten so terribly interested in the floor tiles between their feet  he knew only that the sudden and
incongruous smell of old spice stick deodorant  classic original scent   unbidden and unex plainable  his late obstetric
poppa s brand  not smelled for years   and the tiny panicked twitters with which withdrawal s ants skittered glossily up into his
mouth and nose and disappeared  each of course taking its tiny pincered farewell bite as it went  augured some new and vivider
exhibit on the corridor s horizon  he d become  at puberty  violently allergic to the smell of old spice  as he soiled himself and
the plastic seat and floor once again the classic scent of times past intensified  then poor tony s body began to swell  he
watched his limbs become airy white dirigibles and felt them deny his authority and detach from him and float sluggishly up
snout first into the steel mill sparks the ceiling rained  he suddenly felt nothing  or rather nothing  a pre tornadic stillness of zero
sensation  as if he were the very space he occupied 
then he had a seizure        the floor of the subway car became the ceiling of the subway car and he was on his arched
back in a waterfall of light  gagging on old spice and watching his tumid limbs tear ass around the car s interior like undone
balloons  the booming zuckung zuckung zuckung was his high heels  heels drumming on the soiled floor s tile  he heard a
rushing train roar that was no train on earth and felt a vascular roaring rushing that until the pain hit seemed like the gathering of a
kind of orgasm of the head  his head inflated hugely and creaked as it stretched  inflating  then the pain  seizures hurt  is what
few civilians have occasion to know  was the sharp end of a hammer  there was a squeak and rush of release inside his skull and
something shot from him into the air  he saw bobby   c   c s blood misting upward in the hot wind of the copley blower  his
father knelt beside him on the ceiling in a well rended sleeveless tee   extolling the red sox of rice and lynn  tony wore
summer taffeta  his body flopped around without ok from hq  he didn t feel one bit like a puppet  he thought of gaffed fish 
the gown had  a thousand flounces and a saucy bodice of lace crochet   then he saw his father  green gowned and rubber gloved 
leaning to read the headlines off the skin of a fish a newspaper had wrapped  that had never happened  the largest print headline
said push  poor tony flopped and gasped and pushed down inside and the utter red of the blood that feeds sight bloomed behind
his fluttering lids  time wasn t passing so much as kneeling beside him in a torn tee shirt disclosing the rodent nosed tits of a man
who disdains the care of his once comely bod  poor tony convulsed and drummed and gasped and fluttered  a fountain of light all
around him  he felt a piece of nourishing and possibly even intoxicating meat in the back of his throat but elected not to swallow
it but swallowed it anyway  and was immediately sorry he did  and when his father s bloody rubbered fingers folded his teeth back
to retrieve the tongue he d swallowed he refused absolutely to bite down ungratefully on the hand that was taking his food  then
without authorization he pushed and bit down and took the gloved fingers clean off  so there was rubber wrapped meat in his
mouth again and his father s head exploded into needled antennae of color like an exploding star between his gown s raised green
arms and a call for zuckung while tony s heels drummed and struggled against the widening stirrups of light they were hoisted
into while a curtain of red was drawn wetly up over the floor he stared down at  tony  and he heard someone yelling for someone
to give in  err  with a hand on his lace belly as he bore down to push and he saw the legs in the stirrups they held would keep
spreading until they cracked him open and all the way inside out on the ceiling and his last worry was that red handed poppa
could see up his dress  what was hidden

through long lists of who beat whom and by how much  his quest for synonyms for beat and got beat by is never ending and
serious and a continual source of irritation to his friends  mary esther s exams were notorious no brainers and automatic a s if you

and though tex watson s overall handle on cold containment dt annulation is shaky  his lay physics survey of combustion and
annulation has some sort of academic validity to it  especially because he some terms gets pemulis to guest lecture when he and
pemulis are in a period of detente  but the only really challenging prorected class ever for hal incandenza is turning out to be
mile  thierry poutrincourt s  separatism and return  quebecois history from frontenac through the age of interdependence  
which to be candid hal d never heard much positive about and had always deflected his moms s suggestions that he might
profitably take until finally this term s schedule juggling got dicey  and which  the class  he finds difficult and annoying but
surprisingly less and less dull as the semester wears on  and is actually developing something of a layman s savvy for canadianism
and o n a n ite politics  topics he d previously found for some reason not only dull but queerly distasteful  the rub of this
particular class s difficulty is that pou trincourt teaches only in quebecois french  which hal can get by in because of his youthful
tour through orin s real french pleiade classics but has never all that much liked  particularly sound wise  quebecois being a gurgly  glottal language that seems to require a perpetually sour facial expression to pronounce  hal sees no way of orin s knowing
he was taking poutrincourt s  separatism and return  when he called to ask for help with separatism  which orin s asking for help
from him with anything was strange enough in itself

most of the early quebec stuff about cartier and roberval and cap rouge and champlain and flocks of ursuline nuns with
frozen wimples covered up to like u n  day hal d found mostly dry and repetitive  the wig and jerkin gentlemanly warfare stilted

levesque parti and bloc quebecois       and early fronte de la liberation nationale stuff and up to the present interdependent
era  poutrincourt s lecture voice has gotten quieter and quieter as history s approached its contemporary limit  and hal  finding the
stuff rather more high concept and less dull than he d expected   seeing himself as at his innermost core apolitical  
nevertheless found the quebecois separatism mentality almost impossibly convolved and confused and impervious to u s 
parsing        plus was both com  and repelled by the fact that the contemporary anti o n a n  insurgence stuff provoked
in him a queasy feeling  not the glittery disorientation of nightmares or on court panic but a soggier  more furtively nauseous kind
of sense  as if someone had been reading mail of hal s that he thought he d thrown away 
the proud and haughty quebecois had been harassing and even terrorizing the rest of canada over the separation issue for
time out of mind  it was the establishment of o n a n  and the gerrymandering of the great convexity  poutrincourt s canadian 
recall  that turned the malevolent attention of quebec s worst post f l n  insurgents south of the border  ontario and new
brunswick took the continental anschluss and territorial reconfiguration like good sports  certain far right fringes in alberta
weren t too pleased  but not much pleases an albertan far rightist anyway  it was  finally  only the proud and haughty quebecois
who whinged        and the insurgent cells of quebec who completely lost their political shit 
quebec s anti o n a n  and thus  u s  separatisteurs  the different terrorist cells formed when ottawa had been the foe 
proved to be not a very nice bunch at all  the earliest unignorable strikes involved a then unknown terrorist cell       that
apparently snuck down from the e w d  blighted pa pineau region at night and dragged huge standing mirrors across u s  interstate    at selected dangerous narrow winding adirondack passes south of the border and its lucite walls  naively empiricist
north bound u s  motorists   a good many of them military and o n a n ite personnel  this close to the concavity   would see
impending headlights and believe some like suicidal idiot or canadian had transversed the median and was coming right for them 
they d flash their high beams  but to all appearances the impending idiot would just flash his high beams right back  the u s 
motorists   usually not to be fucked with in their vehicles  historically  it was well known   would brazen it out as long as
anyone right minded possibly could  but right before apparent impact with the impending lights they d always veer wildly and
leave shoulderless      and put their arm over their head in that screaming pre crash way and go ass over teakettle into an
adirondack chasm with a many petaled bloom of hi test flame  and the then unknown quebecois terrorist cell would remove the
huge mirror and truck off back up north via checkpointless back roads back into the blighted bowels of southern quebec until next
time  there were fatalities this way well into the year of the tucks medicated pad before anyone had any idea they were diaboliccell related  for over twenty months the scores of burnt out hulls piling up in adirondack chasms were regarded as either suicides
or inexplicable doze behind the wheel type single car accidents by nny state troopers who had to detach their chinstraps to
scratch under their big brown hats over the mysterious sleepiness that seemed to afflict adirondack motorists at what looked to be

 high adrenaline mountaintop passes  chief of the new united states office of unspecified services rodney tine pressed  to his
later embarrassment  for a series of anti driving when drowsy public service spots to be interlace disseminated in upstate new
new york  it was an actual u s  would be suicide  a late stage valium addicted amway distributor from schenectady who was at
the end of her benzodioxane rope and all over the road anyway  and who by historical accounts saw the sudden impending
headlights in her northbound lane as grace and shut her eyes and floored it right for them  the lights  never once veering  spraying
glass and micronized silver over all four lanes  this unwitting civilian who  smashed the illusion    made the
breakthrough   media headlines   and brought to light the first tangible evidence of an anti o n a n  ill will way worse
than anything aroused by plain old historical separatism  up in quebec 
the first birth of the incandenzas  second son was a surprise  the tall and eye poppingly curvaceous avril incandenza did not
show  bled like clockwork  no hemorrhoids or gland static  no pica  affect and appetite normal  she threw up some mornings but
who didn t in those days 
it was on a metal lit november evening in the seventh month of a hidden pregnancy that she stopped  avril  on her husband s
long arm as they ascended the maple staircase of the back bay brownstone they were soon to leave  stopped  turned partly toward
him  ashen  and opened her mouth in a mute way that was itself eloquent 
her husband looked down at her  paling   what is it  
 it s pain  
it was pain  broken water had made several steps below them gleam  she seemed to james incandenza to sort of turn in
toward herself  hold herself low  curl and sink to a stairstep she barely made the edge of  hunched  her forehead against her
shapely knees  incandenza saw the whole slow thing in a light like he was vermeer  she sank steadily from his side and he bent to
hers and she then tried to rise 
 wait wait wait wait  wait  
 it s pain  
a bit ragged from an afternoon of wild turkey and low temperature holography  james had thought avril was dying right
before his eyes  his own father had dropped dead on a set of stairs  luckily avril s half brother charles tavis was upstairs  using
the portable stairmaster he d brought with him for an extended and emotional battery recharging visit the preceding spring  after
the horrible snafu with the video scoreboard at toronto s skydome  and he heard the commotion and scuttled out and down and
promptly took charge 
he had to be more or less scraped out  mario  like the meat of an oyster from a womb to whose sides he d been found
spiderishly clinging  tiny and unobtrusive  attached by cords of sinew at both feet and a hand  the other fist stuck to his face by the
same material        he was a complete surprise and terribly premature  and withered  and he spent the next many weeks
waggling his withered and contractured arms up at the pyrex ceilings of incubators  being fed by tubes and monitored by wires
and cupped in sterile palms  his head cradled by a thumb  mario had been given the name of dr  james incandenza s father s
father  a dour and golf addicted green valley az oculist who made a small fortune  just after jim grew up and fled east  by
inventing those quote x ray specs  that don t work but whose allure for mid   os pubescent comic book readers almost
compelled mail order  then selling the copyrights to new england novelty industry titan acmeco  then promptly in mid putt died 
mario sr  did  allowing james incandenza sr  to retire from a sad third career as the man from glad       in sandwich bag
commercials during the b s      s and move back to the saguaro studded desert he loathed and efficiently drink himself to a
cerebral hemorrhage on a tucson stairway 
anyway  mario ii s incomplete gestation and arachnoidal birth left the kid with some lifelong character building physical
challenges  size was one  he being in sixth grade about the size of a toddler and at     in a range somewhere between elf and
jockey  there was the matter of the withered looking and bradyauxetic arms  which just as in a hair raising case of volk mann s
contracture       curled out in front of his thorax in magiscule s s and were usable for rudimentary knifeless eating and slapping
at doorknobs until they sort of turned just enough and doors could be kicked open and forming a pretend lens frame to scout
scenes through  plus maybe tossing tennis balls very short distances to players who wanted them  but not for much else  though
the arms were impressively   almost familial dysautonomically   pain resistant  and could be pinched  punctured  singed  and
even compressed in a basement optical device securing viselike thing by mario s older brother orin without effect or complaint 
bradypedestrianism wise  mario had not so much club feet as more like block feet  not only flat but perfectly square  good for
kicking knob fumbled doors open with but too short to be conventionally employed as feet  together with the lordosis in his lower
spine  they force mario to move in the sort of lurchy half stumble of a vaudeville inebriate  body tilted way forward as if into a
wind  right on the edge of pitching face first onto the ground  which as a child he did fairly often  whether given a bit of a shove
from behind by his older brother orin or no  the frequent forward falls help explain why mario s nose was squished severely in
and so flared out to either side of his face but did not rise from it  with the consequence that his nostrils tended to flap just a bit 
particularly during sleep  one eyelid hung lower than the other over his open eyes   good and gently brown eyes  if a bit large
and protrusive to qualify as conventionally human eyes   the one lid hung like an ill tempered windowshade  and his older
brother orin had sometimes tried to give the recalcitrant lid that smart type of downward snap that can unstick a dicky shade  but
had succeeded only in gradually loosening the lid from its sutures  so that it eventually had to be refashioned and reattached in yet
another blepharoplasty procedure  because it was in fact not mario s real eyelid   that had been sacrificed when the fist stuck to
his face like a tongue to cold metal had been peeled away  at nativity   but an extremely advanced blepharoprosthesis of dermal
fibropolymer studded with horsehair lashes that curved out into space well beyond the reach of his other lid s lashes and together
with the lazy lid action itself gave even mario s most neutral expression the character of an oddly friendly pirate s squint  together
with the involuntarily constant smile 
this is probably also the place to mention hal s older brother mario s khaki colored skin  an odd dead gray green that in its
corticate texture and together with his atrophic in curled arms and arachnodactylism gave him  particularly from a middledistance  an almost uncannily reptilian  dinosaurian look  the fingers being not only mucronate and talonesque but nonprehensile 
which is what made mario s knifework untenable at table  plus the thin lank slack hair  at once tattered and somehow too smooth 
that looked at     like the hair of a short plump    year old stress engineer and athletic director and academy headmaster who

 grows one side to girlish length and carefully combs it so it rides thinly up and over the gleaming yarmulke of bare gray greencomplected scalp on top and down over the other side where it hangs lank and fools no one and tends to flap back up over in any
wind charles tavis forgets to carefully keep his left side to  or that he s slow  hal s brother is  technically  stanford binet wise 
slow  the brandeis c d c  found   but not  verifiably not  retarded or cognitively damaged or bradyphrenic  more like refracted 
almost  ever so slightly epis temically bent  a pole poked into mental water and just a little off and just taking a little bit longer  in
the manner of all refracted things 
or that his status at the enfield tennis academy   erected  along with dr  and mrs  fs marriage s third and final home at the
northern rear of the grounds  when mario was nine and hallie eight and orin seventeen and in his one e t a  year b   singles
and in the u s t a  s top      that mario s life there is by all appearances kind of a sad and left out type existence  the only
physically challenged minor in residence  unable even to grip a regulation stick or stand unaided behind a boundaried space  that
he and his late father had been  no pun intended  inseparable  that mario d been like an honorary assistant production assistant
and carried the late incan denza s film and lenses and filters in a complex backpack the size of a joint of beef for most of the last
three years of the late blooming filmmaker s life  attending him on shoots and sleeping with multiple pillows in small soft
available spaces in the same motel room as himself and occasionally tottering out for a bright red plastic bottle of something
called big red soda water and taking it to the apparently mute veiled graduate intern down the motel s hall  fetching coffee and
joe and various pancreatitis remedies and odds and ends for props and helping d  leith out with continuity when incandenza
wanted to preserve continuity  basically being the way any son would be whose dad let him into his heart s final and best loved
love  lurching gamely but not pathetically to keep up with the tall stooped increasingly bats man s slow patient two meter stride
through airports  train stations  carrying the lenses  inclined ever forward but in no way resembling any kind of leashed pet 
when required to stand upright and still  like when videotaping an e t a  s service motion or manning the light meters on the
set of a high contrast chiaroscuro art film  mario in his forward list is supported by a nnyc apartrnent door style police lock  a
   meter steel pole that extends from a special velcroed vest and angles about     down and out to a slotted piece of lead blocking
 a bitch to carry  in that complicated pack  placed by someone understanding and prehensile on the ground before him  he stood
thus buttressed on sets himself had him help erect and furnish and light  the lighting usually unbelievably complex and for some
parts of the crew sometimes almost blinding  sunbursts of angled mirrors and marino lamps and key light kliegs  mario getting a
thorough technical grounding in a cinematic craft he never even imagined being able to pursue on his own until xmas of the year
of the trial size dove bar  when a gaily wrapped package forwarded from the offices of incandenza s attorney revealed that
himself had designed and built and legally willed  in a codicil  to be gaily wrapped and forwarded for mario s thirteenth xmas a
trusty old bolex h   rex         tri lensed camera bolted to an oversized old leather aviator s helmet and supported by struts
whose ends were the inverted tops of training room crutches and curved nicely over mario s shoulders  so the bolex h   required
no digital prehensility because it fit over mario s oversized face       like a tri plated scuba mask and was controlled by a
sewing machine adapted foot treadle  and but even then it took some serious getting used to  and mario s earliest pieces of digital
juvenilia are marred enhanced by this palsied  pointing every which way quality of like home movies shot at a dead run 
five years hence  mario s facility with the head mount bolex attenuates the sadness of his status here  allowing him to
contribute via making the annual e t a  fundraising documentary cartridge  videotaping students  strokes and occasionally from
over the railing of schtitt s supervisory transom the occasional challenge match   the taping s become part of the pro instruction
package detailed in the e t a  catalogue   plus producing more ambitious  arty type things that occasionally find a bit of an aclef type following in the e t a  community 
after orin incandenza left the nest to first hit and then kick collegiate balls  there was almost nobody at e t a  or its enfieldbrighton environs who did not treat mario m  incandenza with the casual gentility of somebody who doesn t pity you or admire
you so much as just vaguely prefer it when you re around  and mario   despite rectilinear feet and cumbersome police lock the
most prodigious walker and recorder in three districts   hit the unsheltered area streets daily at a very slow pace  a halting
constitutional  sometimes w  head mounted bolex and sometimes not  and took citizens  kindness and cruelty the same way  with
a kind of extra inclined half bow that mocked his own canted posture without pity or cringe  mario s an especial favorite among
the low rent shopkeepers up and down e t a  s stretch of commonwealth ave   and photographic stills from some of his better
efforts adorn the walls behind certain comm  ave  deli counters and steam presses and korean keyed cash registers  the object of
a strange and maybe kind of cliquey affection from lyle the spandexed sweat guru  to whom he sometimes brings caffeine free
diet cokes to cut the diet s salt  mario sometimes finds younger e t a s referred to him by lyle on really ticklish matters of
injury and incapacity and character and rallying what remains  and never much knows what to say  trainer barry loach all but
kisses the kid s ring  since it s mario who through coincidence saved him from the rank panhandling underbelly of boston
common s netherworld and more or less got him his job        plus of course there s the fact that schtitt himself
constitutionalizes with him  of certain warm evenings  and lets him ride in his surplus sidecar  an object of some weird attractorepulsive gestalt for charles tavis  mario treats c t  with the quiet deference he can feel his possible half uncle wanting  and
stays out of his way as much as possible  for tavis s sake  players at denny s  when they all get to go to denny s  almost vie to see
who gets to cut up the cut upable parts of mario s under    size kilobreakfast 
and his younger and way more externally impressive brother hal almost idealizes mario  secretly  god type issues aside 
mario is a  semi   walking miracle  hal believes  people who re somehow burned at birth  withered or ablated way past anything
like what might be fair  they either curl up in their fire  or else they rise  withered saurian homodontic       mario floats  for
hal  he calls him booboo but fears his opinion more than probably anybody except their moms s  hal remembers the unending
hours of blocks and balls on the hardwood floors of early childhood s    belle ave   weston ma  tangrams and see  n spell 
huge headed mario hanging in there for games he could not play  for make believe in which he had no interest other than
proximity to his brother  avril remembers mario still wanting hal to help him with bathing and dressing at thirteen   an age
when most unchallenged kids are ashamed of the very space their sound pink bodies take up   and wanting the help for hal s
sake  not his own  despite himself  and showing a striking lack of insight into his moms s psyche   hal fears that avril sees mario
as the family s real prodigy  an in bent savant type genius of no classifiable type  a very rare and shining thing  even if his
intuition   slow and silent   scares her  his academic poverty breaks her heart  the smile he puts on each a m  without fail since

 the suicide of their father makes her wish she could cry  this is why she tries so terribly hard to leave mario alone  not to hover or
wring  to treat him so less specially than she wants  it is for him  it is kind of noble  pitiable  her love for the son who was born a
surprise transcends all other experiences and informs her life  hal suspects  it was mario  not avril  who obtained hal his first
copies of the unabridged o e d  at a time when hal was still being shunted around for the assessment of possible damage 
booboo pulling them home in a wagon by his bicuspids over the fake rural blacktop roads of upscale weston  months before hal
tested out at whatever s beyond eidetic on the mnemonic verbal inventory designed by a dear and trusted colleague of the moms
at brandeis  it was avril  not hal  who insisted that mario live not in hmh with her and charles tavis but with hal in an e t a 
subdorm  but in the year of dairy products from the american heartland it was hal  not she  who  when the veiled legate from
the union of the hideously and improbably deformed showed up at the e t a  driveway s portcullis to discuss with mario issues
of blind inclusion v  visual estrangement  of the openness of concealment the veil might afford him  it was hal  even as mario
laughed and half bowed  it was hal  brandishing his dunlop stick  who told the guy to go peddle his linen someplace else 

   april     may year of the depend adult undergarment
the sky of u s a  s desert was clotted with blue stars  now it was deep at night  only above the u s a  city was the sky
blank of stars  its color was pearly and blank  marathe shrugged   perhaps in you is the sense that citizens of canada are not
involved in the real root of the threat  
steeply shook the head in seeming annoyance   what s that supposed to mean   he said  the lurid wig of him slipped when he
moved the head with any abrupt force 
the first way marathe betrayed anything of emotion was to smooth rather too fussily at the blanket on his lap   it is meaning
that it will not of finality be quebecers making this kick to i aine des etats urn s  look  the facts of the situation speak loudly 
what is known  this is a u s a  production  this entertainment cartridge  made by an american man in the u s a  the appetite
for the appeal of it  this also is u s a  the u s a  drive for spectation  which your culture teaches  this i was saying  this is why
choosing is everything  when i say to you choose with great care in loving and you make ridicule it is why i look and say  can i
believe this man is saying this thing of ridicule   marathe leaned slightly forward on his stumps  leaving the machine pistol to use
both his hands in saying  steeply could tell this was important to marathe  he really believed it 
marathe made small emphatic circles and cuts in the air while he spoke   these facts of situation  which speak so loudly of
your bureau s fear of this samizdat  now is what has happened when a people choose nothing over themselves to love  each one  a
u s a  that would die   and let its children die  each one   for the so called perfect entertainment  this film  who would die for
this chance to be fed this death of pleasure with spoons  in their warm homes  alone  unmoving  hugh steeply  in complete
seriousness as a citizen of your neighbor i say to you  forget for a moment the entertainment  and think instead about a u s a 
where such a thing could be possible enough for your office to fear  can such a u s a  hope to survive for a much longer time 
to survive as a nation of peoples  to much less exercise dominion over other nations of other peoples  if these are other peoples
who still know what it is to choose  who will die for something larger  who will sacrifice the warm home  the loved woman at
home  their legs  their life even  for something more than their own wishes of sentiment  who would choose not to die for
pleasure  alone  
steeply removed with cool deliberation another belgian cigarette and lit it  this time on the first match  waving the match out
with a circular flourish and snap  all this took time of his silence  marathe settled back  marathe wondered why the presence of
americans could always make him feel vaguely ashamed after saying things he believed  an aftertaste of shame after revealing
passion of any belief and type when with americans  as if he had made flatulence instead of had revealed belief 
steeply rested his one elbow on the forearm of the other arm across his prostheses  to smoke like a woman   you re saying
that the administration wouldn t even be concerned about the entertainment if we didn t know we were fatally weak  as in as a
nation  you re saying the fact that we re worried speaks volumes about the nation itself  
marathe shrugged   us  we will force nothing on u s a  persons in their warm homes  we will make only available 
entertainment  there will be then some choosing  to partake or choose not to   smoothing slightly at his lap s blanket   how will
u s a s choose  who has taught them to choose with care  how will your offices and agencies protect them  your people 
by laws  by killing quebecois   marathe rose  but very slightly   as you were killing colombians and bolivians to protect
u s a  citizens who desire their narcotics  how well did this work for your agencies and offices  the killing  how long was it
before the brazilians replaced the dead of colombia  
steeply s wig had slipped hard to starboard   remy  no  drug dealers don t want you dead  necessarily  they just want your
money  there s a difference  you people seem to want us dead  not just the concavity re demised  not just secession for quebec 
the f l q   maybe they re like the bolivians  but fortier wants us dead  
 again you pass over what is important  why b s s  cannot understand us  you cannot kill what is already dead  
 just you wait and see if we re dead  paisano  
marathe made a gesture as if striking his own head   again passing over the important  this appetite to choose death by
pleasure if it is available to choose   this appetite of your people unable to choose appetites  this is the death  what you call the
death  the collapsing  this will be the formality only  do you not see  this was the genius of guillaume duplessis  what m 
duplessis taught the cells  even if f l q  and les fils did not understand  much less the albertans  all crazy inside their head  we
of the a f r   we understand  this is why this cell of quebecers  that danger of entertainment so fine it will kill the viewer  if so
  the exact way does not matter  the exact time of death and way of death  this no longer matters  not for your peoples  you
wish to protect them  but you can only delay  not save  the entertainment exists  the attache and gendarmes of the razzle
incident   more proof  it is there  existing  the choice for death of the head by pleasure now exists  and your authorities know  or
you would not be now trying to stop the pleasure  your sans christe gentle was in this one part correct   someone is to blame  
 that had nothing to do with the reconfiguration  the reconfiguration was self preservation  
 that  forget it  there is the villain he saw you needed  all of you  to delay this splitting apart  to keep you together  the
hating some other  gentle is crazy in his head  but in this  fault of someone  he was correct in saying it  un ennemi commun  but

 not someone outside you  this enemy  someone or some people among your own history sometime killed your u s a  nation
already  hugh  someone who had authority  or should have had authority and did not exercise authority  i do not know  but
someone sometime let you forget how to choose  and what  someone let your peoples forget it was the only thing of importance 
choosing  so completely forgetting that when i say choose to you you make expressions with your face such as  herrrrrre we are
going   someone taught that temples are for fanatics only and took away the temples and promised there was no need for temples 
and now there is no shelter  and no map for finding the shelter of a temple  and you all stumble about in the dark  this confusion
of permissions  the without end pursuit of a happiness of which someone let you forget the old things which made happiness
possible  how is it you say   anything is going    
 and this is why we shudder at what a separate quebec would be like  choose what we tell you  neglect your own wish and
desires  sacrifice  for quebec  for the state  
marathe shrugged   l etat protecteur  
steeply said  does this sound a little familiar  remy  the national socialist neofascist state of separate quebec  you guys
are worse than the worst albertans  totalitarity  cuba with snow  ski immediately to your nearest reeducation camp  for
instructions on choosing  moral eugenics  china  cambodia  chad  unfree  
 unhappy  
 there are no choices without personal freedom  buckeroo  it s not us who are dead inside  these things you find so weak and
contemptible in us   these are just the hazards of being free  
 but what does this u s a  expression want to mean  this buckeroo  
steeply turned to face away into the space they were above   and now here we go  now you will say how free are we if you
dangle fatal fruit before us and we cannot help ourselves from temptation  and we say  human  to you  we say that one cannot be
human without freedom  
marathe s chair squeaked slightly as his weight shifted   always with you this freedom  for your walled up country  always to
shout  freedom  freedom   as if it were obvious to all people what it wants to mean  this word  but look  it is not so simple as
that  your freedom is the freedom from  no one tells your precious individual u s a  selves what they must do  it is this meaning
only  this freedom from constraint and forced duress   marathe over steeply s shoulder suddenly could realize why the skies above
the coruscating city were themselves erased of stars  it was the fumes from the exhaust s wastes of the moving autos  pretty lights
that rose and hid stars from the city and made the city tucson s lume nacreous in the dome s blankness of it   but what of the

how for the person to freely choose  how to choose any but a child s greedy choices if there is no loving filled father to guide

steeply threw away a cigarette and faced partly marathe  from the edge   now the story of the rich man  
marathe said  the rich father who can afford the cost of candy as well as food for his children  but if he cries out  freedom  
and allows his child to choose only what is sweet  eating only candy  not pea soup and bread and eggs  so his child becomes weak
and sick  is the rich man who cries  freedom   the good father  
steeply made four small noises  excitement of some belief made the american s electrolysis s little pimples of rash redden
even in the milky dilute light of lume and low stars  the moon over the mountains of rincon was on its side  its color the color of
a fat man s face  marathe could believe he could hear some young u s a  voices shouting and laughing in a young gathering
somewhere out on the desert floor below  but saw no headlights or young persons  steeply stamped a high heel in frustration 
steeply said 
 but u s  citizens aren t presumed by us to be children  to pater nalistically do their thinking and choosing for them  human
beings are not children  
marathe pretended again to sniff 
 ah  yes  but then you say  no   steeply said   no  you say  not children  you say  what is the difference  please  if you make
a recorded pleasure so entertaining and diverting it is lethal to persons  you find a copy capable copy and copy it and disseminate
it for us to choose to see or turn off  and if we cannot choose to resist it  the pleasure  and cannot choose instead to live  you say
what your fortier believes  that we are children  not human adults like the noble quebecers  we are children  bullies but still
children inside  and will kill ourselves for you if you put the candy within the arms  reach  
marathe tried to make his face expressive of anger  which was difficult for him   this is what happens  you imagine the things
i will say and then say them for me and then become angry with them  without my mouth  it never opens  you speak to yourself 
inventing sides  this itself is the habit of children  lazy  lonely  self  i am not even here  possibly  for listening to

  november year of the depend adult undergarment
interdependence day
gaudeamus igitur
every year at e t a   maybe a dozen of the kids between maybe like twelve and fifteen   children in the very earliest stages
of puberty and really abstract capable thought  when one s allergy to the confining realities of the present is just starting to emerge
as weird kind of nostalgia for stuff you never even knew         maybe a dozen of these kids  mostly male  get fanatically
devoted to a homemade academy game called eschaton  eschaton is the most complicated children s game anybody around
e t a  d ever heard of  no one s entirely sure who brought it to enfield from where  but you can pretty easily date its conception
from the mechanics of the game itself  its basic structure had already pretty much coalesced when allston s michael pemulis hit
age twelve and helped make it way more compelling  its elegant complexity  combined with a dismissive reenactment frisson and
a complete disassociation from the realities of the present  composes most of its puerile appeal  plus it s almost addictively
compelling  and shocks the tall 

 this year it s been otis p  lord  a thirteen year old baseliner and calculus phenom from wilmington de  who  wears the
beanie  as eschaton s game master and statistician of record  though pemulis  since he s still around and is far and away the
greatest eschaton player in e t a  history  has a kind of unofficial emeritus power of correction over lord s calculations and mandate 
eschaton takes eight to twelve people to play  w      tennis balls so dead and bald they can t even be used for service drills
anymore  plus an open expanse equal to the area of four contiguous tennis courts  plus a head for data retrieval and coldly logical
cognition  along with at least    megabytes of available ram and wide array of tennis paraphernalia  the vade mecumish
rulebook that pemulis in y p w  got hal incandenza to write   with appendices and sample c  pink  mathpak endstat path
decision tree diagrams and an offset of the most accessible essay pemulis could find on applied game theory   is about as long
and interesting as j  bunyan s stupefying pilgrim s progress from this world to that which is to come  and a pretty tough nut to
compress into anything lively  although every year a dozen more e t a  kids memorize the thing at such a fanatical depth that
they sometimes report reciting mumbled passages under light dental or cosmetic anesthesia  years later   but if hal had a luger
pointed at him and were under compulsion to try  he d probably start by explaining that each of the     dead tennis balls in the
game s global arsenal represents a   mega ton thermonuclear warhead  of the total number of a given day s players        three
compose a theoretical anschluss designated amnat  another three sovwar  one or two redchi  another one or two the
wacko but always pesky libsyr or more formidable irlibsyr  and that the day s remaining players  depending on involved
random considerations  can form anything from southaf to indpak to like an independent cell of nuck insurgents with a   click howitzer and big ideas  each team is called a combatant  on the open expanse of contiguous courts  combatants are arrayed
in positions corresponding to their location on the planet earth as represented in the rand mcnally slightly rectangular hanging
map of the world        practical distribution of total megatonnage requires a working knowledge of the mean value theorem
for integrals        but for hal s synoptic purposes here it s enough to say that megatonnage is distributed among combatants
according to an integrally regressed ratio of  a  combatant s yearly military budget as percentage of combatant s yearly gnp to
 b  the inverse of stratego tactical expenditures as percentage of combatant s yearly military budget  in quainter days  combatants 
balls were simply doled out by throws of shiny red yahtzee dice  quaint chance is no longer required  because pemulis has
downloaded mathpak unltd  s elegant endstat       stats cruncher software into the late james incandenza s fearsome idle dropclothed d e c        and has shown otis p  lord how to dicky the lock to schtitt s office at night with a dining hall meal card and
plug the d e c  into a three prong that s under the lower left corner of the enormous print of durer s  the magnificent beast  on
the wall by the relevant edge of schtitt s big glass desk  so schtitt or delint won t even know it s on  when it s on  then link it by
cellular modem to a slick yushityu portable with color monitor out on the courts  nuclear theater  amnat and sovwar usually
end up with about     total megatons each  with the rest inconsistently divided  it s possible to complicate pemulis s mean value
equation for distribution by factoring in stuff like historical incidences of bellicosity and appeasement  unique characteristics of
perceived national interests  etc   but lord  the son of not one but two bankers  is a straight bang for buck type of apportioner  a
stance the equally bottom line minded michael pemulis endorses with both thumbs  pieces of tennis gear are carefully placed
within each combatant s territories to mirror and map strategic targets  folded gray on red e t a  t shirts are mamas   major
metro areas  towels stolen from selected motels on the junior tour stand for airfields  bridges  satellite linked monitoring
facilities  carrier groups  conventional power plants  important rail convergences  red tennis shorts with gray trim are
conforcons   conventional force concentrations  the black cotton e t a  armbands   for when god forbid there s a death
  designate the noncontemporary game era s atomic power plants  uranium   plutonium enrichment facilities  gaseous diffusion
plants  breeder reactors  initiator factories  neutron scattering reflector labs  tritium production reactor vessels  heavy water plants 
semiprivate shaped charge concerns  linear accelerators  and the especially point heavy annular fusion research laboratories in
north syracuse nny and presque isle me  chyonskrg kurgistan and pliscu romania  and possibly elsewhere  red shorts with
gray trim  few in number because strongly disliked by the travelling squads  are sstracs   equally low number but pointintensive sites of strategic command  socks are either missile installations or antimissile installations or isolated silo clusters or
cruise capable b  or ss  squadrons   let s draw the curtain of charity across any more milabbrevs   depending on whether
they re boys  tennis socks or boys  street shoe socks or girls  tennis socks with the little bunny tail at the heel or girls  tennis socks
w o the bunny tail  toe worn cast off corporate supplied sneakers sit open mouthed and serenely lethal  strongly suggesting the
subs they stand for 
in the game  combatants    megaton warheads can be launched only with hand held tennis racquets  hence the requirement
of actual physical targeting skill that separates eschaton from rotisserie league holocaust games played with protractors and pcs
around kitchen tables  the paraboloid transcontinental flight of a liquid fuel strategic delivery vehicle closely resembles a topspin
lob  one reason the e t a  administration and staff unofficially permit eschaton to absorb students  attention and commitment
might be that the game s devotees tend to develop terrific lobs  pemulis s lobs can nail a coin on the baseline two out of three times
off either side  is why it s idiotic that he rushes the net so much instead of letting the other guy come in more  warheads can be
launched independently or packed into an intricately knotted athletic supporter designed to open out in midflight and release
multiple independent reentry vehicles   mirvs  mirvs  being a profligate use of a combatant s available megatonnage  tend
to get used only if a game of eschaton metastasizes from a controlled set of spasm exchanges   spasex   to an all out
apocalyptic series of punishing strikes against civilian populations   sacpop  few combatants will go to sacpop unless
compelled by the remorseless logic of game theory  since sacpop exchanges usually end up costing both combatants so many
points they re eliminated from further contention  a given es chaton s winning team is simply that combatant with the most
favorable ratio of points for inddir   infliction of death  destruction  and inca pacitation of response   to sufddir  
self evident   though the assignment of point values for each combatant s shirts  towels  shorts  armbands  socks  and shoes is
statistically icky  plus there are also wildly involved corrections for initial megatonnage  population density  land sea air
delivery distributions  and em pulse resistant civil defense expenditures  so that the official victor takes three hours of endstat
number crunching and at least four motrin for otis p  lord to confirm 
another reason why each year s master statistician has to be a special combination of tech wonk and compulsive is that the
baroque apparatus of each eschaton has to be worked out in advance and then sold to a kind of immature and easily bored

 community of world leaders  a quorum of the day s combatants has to endorse a particular simulated world situation as lord s
stayed up well past several bedtimes to develop it  land sea air force distributions  ethnic  sociologic  economic  and even
religious demographics for each combatant  plus broadly sketched psych profiles of all relevant heads of state  prevailing weather
in all the map s quadrants  etc  then everybody playing that day is assigned to a combatant s team  and they all sit down over
purified water and unfatted chips to hash out between combatants stuff like mutual defense alliances  humane war pacts  facilities
for inter combatant communication  defcon gradients  city trading  and so on  since each combatant s team knows only their
own situation profile and total available megatonnage   and since even out in the four court theater the stockpiled warheads are
hidden from view inside the identical white plastic cast off industrial solvent buckets all academies and serious players use for
drill balls         there can be a lot of poker facing about response resolve  willingness to go sacpop  nonnegotiable
interests  em pulse immunity  distribution of strategic forces  and commitment to geopolitical ideals  you should have seen
michael pemulis just about eat the whole world alive during pre eschaton summits  back when he played  his teams won most
games before the first lob landed 
what often takes the longest to get a quorum on is each game s triggering situation  here lord  like many stellar statisticswonks  shows a bit of an achilles  heel imagination wise  but he s got a good five or six years of eschaton precedents to draw on 
a russo chinese border dispute goes tactical over sinkiang  an amnat computracker in the aleutians misreads a flight of
geese as three sovwar ssios on reentry  israel moves armored divisions north and east through jordan after an el al airbus is
bombed in midflight by a cell linked to both h sseins  black albertan wackos infiltrate an isolated silo at ft  chimo and get two
mirvs through southaf s defense net  north korea invades south korea  vice versa  amnat is within    hours of putting
an impregnable string of antimissile satellites on line  and the remorseless logic of game theory compels sovwar to go
sacpop while it still has the chance 
on interdependence day  sunday       game master lord s triggering situation unwinds nicely  on pemulis s view 
explosions of suspicious origin occur at amnat satellite receiver stations from turkey to labrador as three high level canadian
defense ministers vanish and then a couple of days later are photographed at a volgograd bistro hoisting shots of stolichnaya with
slavic bimbos on their knee        then two sovwar trawlers just inside international waters off washington are strafed by
fi s on patrol out of cape flattery naval base  both amnat and sovwar go from defcon   to defcon    redchi goes
to defcon    in response to which sovwar airfields and antimissile networks from irkutsk to the dzhugdzhur range go to
defcon    in response to which amnat sac bombers and antimissile missile silos in nebraska and south dakota and
saskatchewan and eastern spain assume a maximum readiness posture  sovwar s bald and port wine stained premier calls

what one pentagon analyst calls  a serious wienie roast   despite the fact that nobody but sovwar itself has anybody close

ringing sovwar s premier from the air and gets only the premier s answering machine  amnat is unable to determine whether
the string of explosions at its radar installations all along the arctic circle are conventional or tactical  cia nsa reports that

  that endstat s game theoretic decision tree now dictates a spasex response from amnat 
uninitiated adults who might be parked in a nearby mint green advertorial ford sedan or might stroll casually past e t a  s
four easternmost tennis courts and see an atavistic global nuclear conflict game played by tanned and energetic little kids and so
this might naturally expect to see fuzzless green warheads getting whacked indiscriminately skyward all over the place as
everybody gets blackly drunk with thanatoptic fury in the crisp november air   these adults would more likely find an actual
game of es chaton strangely subdued  almost narcotized looking  your standard round of eschaton moves at about the pace of
chess between adepts  for these devotees become  on court  almost parodically adult   staid  sober  humane  and judicious
twelve year old world leaders  trying their best not to let the awesome weight of their responsibilities   responsibilities to nation 
globe  rationality  ideology  conscience and history  to both the living and the unborn   not to let the terrible agony they feel at
the arrival of this day   this dark day the leaders ve prayed would never come and have taken every conceivable measure
rationally consistent with national strategic interest to avoid  to prevent   not to let the agonizing weight of responsibility
compromise their resolve to do what they must to preserve their people s way of life  so they play  logically  cautiously  so earnest

 and deliberate in their calculations they appear thoroughly and queerly adult  almost talmudic  from a distance  a couple gulls fly
overhead  a mint green ford sedan has passed through the gate s raised portcullis and is trying to parallel park between two
dumpsters in the circular drive behind west house  which is behind and to the neck straining left of the gatorade pavilion  there s
an autumnal tang to the air and a brittle gray shell of cloud cover  plus the constant faraway hum of sunstrand plaza s athscme
fan line 
strategic acumen and feel for realism vary from kid to kid  of course  when irlibsyr s evan ingersoll starts lobbing
warheads at sovwar s belt of third wave reserve silos in the kazakh  and it becomes pretty clear that amnat has won
irlibsyr to its side by making sinister promises about the ultimate disposition of israel  israel  even though nobody s israel out
there today  seems in a fit of pique to have somehow persuaded southaf  who today is brooklyn ny s little hard ass josh
gopnik   the same josh gopnik who by the way subscribes to commentary   to expend all sixteen of its green fuzzy warheads
in a debilitating enfilade against amnat dams  bridges  and bases from florida to baja  everybody involved orders total
displacement of mama populations  then  without any calculation whatever  indpak  who today is j  j  penn   a high ranked
thirteen year old but not exactly the brightest log on the yuletide fire   dumps three poorly tied jockstraps  worth of mirvs on

roundly kibitzed from the shelter of the gatorade pavilion under schtitt s tower by troeltsch  axford  and incandenza  penn
shrilly reminds them that pakistan is a muslim state and sworn foe to all infidelic enemies of islam  but can do little but fiddle
with the strings of his launcher when pemulis cheerfully reminds him that nobody s israel today and there isn t so much as a
combatant s sock on that part of the courts  it is not a matter of the principle of thing  ever  in es chaton 
except for the southaf flurry and indpak boner       s game proceeds with much probity and cold deliberation  with
even more pauses and hushed  chin stroking conferences today than tend to be the norm  the only harried looking person on the
     m   map is otis p  lord  who has to keep legging it from one continent to another  pushing a rolling double shelf stainless
steel food cart purloined from st  john of god hospital with a blinking yushityu portable on one shelf and a     capacity diskette
case about two thirds full on the other  the shelves  sides hung with clattering clipboards  lord having to dramatize manually the
effortless dictates of real logic and necessity  verifying that command decisions are allowable functions of situation and capacity
 he d shrugged his shoulders in a neutral whatever at southaf and indpak   locating necessary data for subterranean
premiers and dictators and airsick presidents  removing vaporized articles of clothing from sites of devastating hits and just
woppsing them up or folding them over at the sites of near hits and fizzle yields  triangulating em pulse estimates from confirmed
hits to authorize or deny communication capacity  it s a nerve racking job  he s more or less having to play god  tallying kill ratios
and radiation levels and parameters of fallout  strontium    and iodine levels and the likelihood of conflagrations v  firestorms in
mamas with different mean value skyscraper heights and combustible capital indices  despite chapped hands and a badly
running nose  lord s response time to requests for data is impressive  thanks mainly to the sly d e c  hookup and the detailed
decision algorithm files pemulis had authored three years back  otis p  lord informs sovwar and am nat that peoria il s
topographic flatness ups the effective kill radius for sovwar s   megaton direct hit to      clicks  meaning half of this mamapop burns to death in evacuatory traffic jams out on interstate     an amnat minuteman can hold an absolute maximum of
eight mirvs irregardless of whether the titanic jockstrap little lamont chu promoted out of the sedated teddy schacht s gear bag
on the bus friday night can hold thirteen dead tennis balls  given standard climatic conditions  the fire area from an air burst will
be  ir times larger than the blast area  toronto has enough sub code skyscrapers within its total area to guarantee a firestorm off a

probably notice the difference  struck and trevor axford hoot loudly from under the green gatorade thirst aid awning of
the open air pavilion outside the fence along the south side of the east courts  where  the pavilion  they and michael pemulis and
jim troeltsch and hal incandenza are splayed on reticulate mesh patio chairs in street clothes and with their street sneakers up on
reticulate mesh footstools  struck and axford with suspiciously bracing gatorades and what looks like a hand rolled
psychochemical cigarette of some sort being passed between them       is an e t a  day of mandatory total r r  though the
public intoxicants are a bit much  pemulis has a bag of red skinned peanuts he hasn t eaten much of  trevor axford has
overinhaled from the cigarette and is hunched coughing  his forehead purple  hal incandenza is squeezing a tennis ball and
leaning out far to starboard to spit into a nasa glass on the ground and struggling with a strong desire to get high again for the
second time since breakfast v  a strong distaste about smoking dope with in front of all these others  especially out in the open in
front of little buddies  which seems to him to violate some sort of issue of taste that he struggles to articulate satisfactorily to
himself  a tooth way back on the upper left is twinging electrically in the cold air  pemulis  though from his twitchy right eye he s
clearly had recent recourse to some tenuate  which helps explain the uneaten nuts   is currently abstaining and sitting on his
hands for warmth  peanuts on the floor well away from hal s nasa glass  the pavilion is open on all sides and compliments of

awning gets taken down when they go into the lung for the winter  eschaton traditionally commandeers courts      the really
nice east courts  unless there s legit tennis going on  all the upperclass spectators except jim struck are former eschaton
devotees  though hal and troeltsch were both marginal  troeltsch  who s also pretty clearly had some tenuate  is left eyenystagmic and is calling the action into a disconnected broadcast headset  but eschaton s tough to enliven  verbally  even for the
stimulated  being generally too slow and cerebral 
struck is telling axford to put his hands over his head and pemulis is telling axford to hold his breath  now  in a stressheightened voice  otis p  lord says he needs pemulis to real quick come zip inside through the cyclone fence gate south of court
   and walk across the theater s four court map to show lord how to access the endstat calculation that every thousand

 roentgens of straight x and gamma produces      deaths per hundred pop and for the other       means reduced lifespans of
 total r               total r       
years  meaning nobody s exactly going to have to be pricing dentures in minsk  so to speak  in the future  and so on 
after about half the planet s extant megatonnage has been expended  things are looking pretty good for the amnat crew 
even though they and sovwar are spasexing back and forth with chilling accuracy   sovwar s designated launcher is the
butch and suspiciously muscular ann kittenplan  who at twelve and a half looks like a belorussian shot putter and has to buy
urine more than quarter annually and has a way more lush and impressive mustache than for instance hal himself could raise  and
who gets these terrible rages  but so kittenplan s landed nothing worse than an indirect hit all afternoon  while amnat s
launchman is todd   postal weight   possalthwaite  an endomorphic thirteen year old from edina mn whose whole infuriating
tennis game consists of nothing but kick serves and topspin lobs  and who s been the eschaton mvl       for the last two years 
and accuracy wise has to be seen to be believed   still  both sides have artfully avoided the escalation to sacpop that often
takes both super combatants right out of the game  and amnat s president lamont chu has used the excuse of gopnik s
emotional strikes against the u s  south  plus penn s arational lobbing at an israel that at the summit was explicitly placed under
amnat s mutual defense umbrella  has used these as golden tactical geese  racking up serious inddir points against a
southaf and indpak whose hasty defensive alliance and shaky aim produce nothing more than a lot of irradiated cod off
gloucester  whenever there s a direct hit  troeltsch sits up straight and gets to use the exclamation he s hit on for a kind of
announcerial trademark   ho  y crow   but sovwar  beset from two vectors by amnat and irlibsyr  whose occasional
lob israel s way amnat  drawing a storm of diplomatic protest from southaf and indpak  keeps instructing lord to log as
 regrettable mistargetings    even with cutting edge civil defense and emp resistant communications  poor old sovwar is
absorbing such serious collateral sufddir that it s being inexorably impelled by game theoretic logic to a position where it s
going to pretty much have no choice but to go sacpop against amnat 
now sovwar premier timmy   sleepy t p    peterson petitions o  p  lord for capacity authorization to place a scrambled
call to air force one   scrambled call  means they don t yell at each other publicly across the courts  map  lord has to ferry
messages from one side the other  complete with inclined heads and hushed tones etc  premier and president exchange standard
formalities  premier apologizes for the prince albert crack  hal  who s declining all public chemicals  he s decided  has a gander at
pemulis s rough tallies of combatants  inddir sufddir ratios so far and agrees to bet axford a u s  finski no way amnat
accepts sovwar s invitation to possible terms  during actionless diplomatic intervals like this  troeltsch is reduced to saying
 what a beautiful day for an eschaton  over and over and asking people for their thoughts on the game until pemulis tells him he s
cruising to get dope slapped  there s pretty much nobody around  tavis and schtitt are off giving what are essentially recruitingtalks at indoor clubs in the west suburbs  pemulis d let tall paul shaw take the multi emblazoned tow truck to take mario down to
the public gardens to watch the public i  day festivities with the bolex h    the local kids often go home for the day  a lot of the
rest like to lie in the viewing rooms barely moving all i  day until the dinner gala  lord tear asses back and forth between courts

hospital that pemulis knew from allston  has one of those crazy left front wheels that e g  seems always to afflict only your
particular grocery cart in supermarkets  and makes a hell of a clattering racket when rushed   ferrying messages which the    andunder guys can tell amnat and sovwar are making deliberately oblique and obtuse so lord has to do that much more
running  god is never a particularly popular role to have to play  and lord this fall has already been the victim of several
boarding school type pranks too puerile even to detail  j  a  l  struck jr   who as usual has made a swine of himself with the
suspiciously bracing cups of gatorade  is abruptly ill all over his own lap and then sort of slumps to one side in his patio chair
with his face slack and white and doesn t hear pemulis s quick analysis that hal might as well give axhandle the   right now 
because lamont chu can parse a decision tree with the best of them  and the d  tree s now indicating peace terms in whatever a
d  tree s version of neon letters is  because the biggest priority for amnat right at     h  is to avoid having to sacpop with
sovwar  since if the game stops right now amnat s probably won  whereas if they sacpop with sovwar  trading
massive infliction of inddir for massive body shots of sufddir  staying more or less even with each other  am nat ll still
be the same number of points ahead of sovwar overall  but it ll have taken such heavy sufddir debits that irlibsyr  
never forget irlibsyr  brilliantly if obnoxiously imam d today by eleven year old eye browless evan ingersoll of binghamton
nny   by staying out of the sacpop fest and lobbing sporadically at sovwar just often enough to rack up serious inddir
but not quite enough to piss sovwar off enough to provoke the retaliatory sslo wave that would mean significant sufddir 
could well have a serious shot at overtaking amnat for the overall eschaton  especially when you factored in the f x 
advantages for bellicosity and nonexistent civil defense  at some point axford has passed the remainder of the cigarette back over
toward struck without looking to see that struck is no longer in his chair  and hal finds himself taking the proffered dubois and
smoking dope in public without even thinking about it or having consciously decided to go ahead  sure enough  poor red faced
runny nosed lord is making way too many clattering trips between courts   and   for it to mean anything but peace terms  evan
ingersoll is positively strip mining his right nostril  finally lord stops with the running back and forth and positions himself in the
ad service box of court   and loads a new diskette into the yushityu  struck moans something in a possibly foreign tongue  all
the other upperclass spectators have scooted their chairs well away from struck  troeltsch extends a blood blistered palm and rubs
the tips of the hand s fingers together at hal  and hal forks over the fin without handing the thin cigarette back over to axford 
somehow  pemulis has leaned forward intently with his pointy chin in his hands  he seems completely absorbed 
interdependence day y d a u  s eschaton enters probably its most crucial phase  lord  at his cart and portable tp  puts on
the white beanie  n b   not the black or the red beanie  that signals a temporary cessation of spasex between two combatants but
allows all other combatants to go on pursuing their strategic interests as they see fit  sovwar and amnat are thus pretty
vulnerable right now  sovwar s premier peterson and air marshal kittenplan  carrying their white janitorial stockpile bucket
between them  walk across europe and the atlantic to parley with amnat president chu and supreme commander
possalthwaite in what looks to be roughly sierra leone  various territories smolder quietly  the other players are mostly standing
around beating their arms against their chests to stay warm  a few hesitant white flakes appear and swirl around and melt into
dark stars the moment they hit court  a couple ostensible world leaders run here and there in a rather unstatesmanlike fashion with

 their open mouths directed at the sky  trying to catch bits of the fall s first snow  yesterday it had been warmer and rained  axford
speculates about whether snow will mean schtitt might consent to inflate the lung even before the fundraiser two weeks hence 
struck is threatening to fall out of his chair  pemulis  leaning forward intently  wearing his mr  howell yachting cap  ignores everyone  he hates to type and keeps his tallies via pencil and clipboard a la delint  the idling ford sedan is conspicuous for the
excruciated full color old nunhagen aspirin ad on the green of its right rear door  hal and axford are passing what looks to the
combatants like a suckerless tootsie roll stick back and forth between them  and occasionally to troeltsch  trevor   the
axhandle   axford has a total of only three and a half digits on his right hand  from west house you can hear mrs  clarke and
the time and a half holiday kitchen staff preparing the interdependence day gala dinner  which always includes dessert 
now redchi  itself quietly trying to rack up some unanswered inddir  sends a towering topspin job into indpak s
quadrant  scoring what redchi claims is a direct hit on karachi and what warheadless indpak claims is only an indirect hit on
karachi  it s an uneasy moment  a dispute such as this would never occur in the real god s real world  since the truth would be
manifest in the actual size of the actual wienie roast in the actual karachi  but god here is played by otis p  lord  and lord is
number crunching so fiendishly at the cart s yushityu  trying to confirm the verisimilitude of the peace terms amnat and
sovwar are hashing out  that he can t even pretend to have seen where redchi s strike against indpak landed w  respect to
karachi s t shirt   which is admittedly kind of mashed and woppsed up  though this could be primarily from breezes and feet  
and in his lapse of omniscience cannot see how he s supposed to allocate the relevant inddir  and sufddir points  troeltsch
doesn t know whether to say  holy crow   or not  lord  vexed by a lapse it s tough to see how any mortal could have avoided 
appeals over to michael pemulis for an independent ruling  and when pemulis gravely shakes his white hatted head  pointing out
that lord is god and either sees or doesn t  in eschaton  lord has an intense little crying fit that s made abruptly worse when now
j  j  penn of indpak all of a sudden gets the idea to start claiming that now that it s snowing the snow totally affects blast area
and fire area and pulse intensity and maybe also has fallout implications  and he says lord has to now completely redo
everybody s damage parameters before anybody can form realistic strategies from here on out 
pemulis s chairlegs shriek and make red skin peanuts spill out in a kind of cornucopic cone shape and he s up in his capacity
as sort of eminence grise of eschaton and ranging up and down just outside the theater s chain link fencing  giving j  j  penn the
very roughest imaginable side of his tongue  besides being real sensitive to any theater boundary puncturing threats to the map s
integrity   threats that ve come up before  and that as pemulis sees it threaten the game s whole sense of animating realism
 which realism depends on buying the artifice of      m   of composition tennis court representing the whole rectangular
projection of the planet earth    pemulis is also a sworn foe of all penns for all time  it had been j  j  penn s much older brother
miles penn  now twenty one and flailing away on the grim third world satellite pro tour  playing for travel expenses in bleak
dysenteric locales  who when pemulis first arrived at e t a  at age eleven had christened him michael penisless and had had
pemulis convinced for almost a year that if he pressed on his belly button his ass would fall off       
 it s snowing on the goddamn map  not the territory  you dick   pemulis yells at penn  whose lower lip is out and quivering 
pemulis s face is the face of a man who will someday need blood pressure medication  a constitution the tenuate doesn t help one
bit  troeltsch is sitting up straight and speaking very intensely and quietly into his headset  hal  who in his day never wore the
beanie  and usually portrayed some marginal nation somewhere out in the nuclear boondocks  finds himself more intrigued by
penn s map  territory faux pas than upset by it  or even amused 
pemulis turns back to the pavilion and seems to be looking at hal in some kind of appeal   jaysusl 
 except is the territory the real world  quote unquote  though   axford calls across to pemulis  who s pacing like the fence is
between him and some sort of prey  axford knows quite well pemulis can be fucked with when he s like this  when he s hot he
always cools down and becomes contrite 
struck tries to yell out a kertwang on pemulis but can t get the megaphone he makes of his hands to fit over the mouth 
 the real world s what the map here stands for   lord lifts his head from the yushityu and cries over at axhandle  trying to
please pemulis 
 kind of looks like real world type snow from here  m p    axford calls out  his forehead s still maroon from the coughing fit 
troeltsch is trying to describe the distinction between the symbolic map of the gear littered courts and the global strategic theater
it stands for using all and only sports broadcast cliches  hal looks from axhandle to pemulis to lord 
struck finally falls out of his chair with a clunk but his legs are still somehow entangled in the legs of the chair  it starts to
snow harder  and dark stars of melt begin to multiply and then merge all over the courts  otis lord is trying to type and wipe his
nose on his sleeve at the same time  j  gopnik and k  mckenna are running around well outside their assigned quadrants with
their tongues outstretched 
 real world snow isn t a factor if it s falling on the fucking map  
ann kittenplan s crew cutted head now protrudes from the kind of rugby scrum amnat s and sovwar s heads of state
form around lord s computational food cart   for christ s sake leave us alone   she shrieks at pemulis  troeltsch is going  oh  my 
into his headset  o  lord is struggling with the cart s protective umbrella  his head s beanie s little white propeller rotating in a
rising wind  a light dusting of snow is starting to appear in the players  hair 
 it s only real world snow if it s already in the scenario   pemulis keeps directing everything at penn  who hasn t said a word
since his original suggestion and is busy sort of casually kicking the karachi shirt over into the arabian sea  clearly hoping the
original detonation will get forgotten about in all the metatheoretical fuss  pemulis rages along the east courts  western fence  the
combination of several tenuate spansules plus eschaton adrenaline bring his blue collar irish right out  he s a muscular but
fundamentally physically narrow guy  head  hands  the sharp little wad of cartilage at the tip of pemulis s nose   everything about
him seems to hal to taper and come to a point  like a bad el greco  hal leans to spit and watches him pace like a caged thing as
lord works feverishly over endstat s peace terms decision matrix  hal wonders  not for the first time  whether he might deep
down be a secret snob about collar color issues and pemulis  then whether the fact that he s capable of wondering whether he s a
snob attenuates the possibility that he s really a snob  though hal hasn t had more than four or five total very small hits off the
public dubois  this is a prime example of what s sometimes called  marijuana thinking   you can tell because hal s leaned way
over to spit but has gotten lost in a paralytic thought helix and hasn t yet spit  even though he s right in bombing position over the

 nasa glass  it also occurs to him that he finds the real snow unreal snow snag in the eschaton extremely abstract but somehow
way more interesting than the eschaton itself  so far 
irlibsyr s strongman evan ingersoll  all of     m  tall  warmed by baby fat and high calorie cerebral endeavor  has been
squatting on his heels like a catcher just west of damascus  spinning his rossignol launcher idly in his hand  watching the onesided exchange between pemulis and ingersoll s roommate j  j  penn  who s now threatening to quit and go in for cocoa if they
can t for once play eschaton without the big guys horning in again like always  there s a tiny whirring sound as ingersoll s mental
gears grind  from the duration of the little sierra leone summit and the studious blankness on everybody s face it s pretty clear
that sovwar and amnat are going to come to terms  and the terms are likely to involve sovwar agreeing not to go
sacpop against amnat in return for amnat letting sovwar go sacpop against ingersoll s irlibsyr  because if
sovwar goes sacpop against an irlibsyr that can t have many warheads left in the old bucket by now  ingersoll knows
they know  then sovwar ll get to rack up a lot of inddir without much sufddir  while inflicting such sufddir on
irlibsyr that irlibsyr ll be effectively eliminated as a threat to amnat s commanding lead in points  which is what has the
most utility in the old game theoretic matrix right now  the exact utility transformations are too oogly for an ingersoll who s still
grappling with fractions  but he can see clearly that this d be the most remorselessly logical best interest conducive scenario for
both lamont chu and especially the sleepster  peterson  who s hated ingersoll for months now anyway without any good reason
or cause or anything  ingersoll can just somehow tell 
hal  paralyzed and absorbed  watches ingersoll bob on his haunches and shift his stick from hand to hand and cerebrate
furiously and logically conclude  then  that irlibsyr s highest possible strategic utility lies in amnat and sovwar failing to
come to terms 
hal can almost visualize a dark lightbulb going on above ingersoll s head  pemulis is telling penn that there s a critical
distinction between horning in and letting asswipes like jeffrey joseph penn run roughshod over the delimiting boundaries that are
eschaton s very life blood  chu and peterson are nodding soberly at little things they re saying to each other while kittenplan
cracks her knuckles and possalthwaite bounces a warhead idly on his strings 
so now evan ingersoll rises from his squat now only to bend again and take a warhead out of irlibsyr s ordnance bucket 
and hal seems to be the only one who sees ingersoll line up the vector very carefully with his slim thumb and take a lavish
backswing and fire the ball directly at the little circle of super combatant leaders in west africa  it s not a lob  it flies straight as if
shot from a rifle and strikes ann kittenplan right in the back of the head with a loud thock  she whirls to face east  a hand at the
back of her bristly skull  scanning and then locking on damascus  her face a stony toltec death mask 
pemulis and penn and lord and everyone else all freeze  shocked and silent  so there s just the weird glittered hiss of falling
snow and the sounds of a couple crows interfacing in the pines over by hmh  the athscme fans are silent  and four sweatsockshaped clouds of exhaust hang motionless over the sunstrand stacks  nothing moves  no eschaton combatant has ever
intentionally struck another combatant s physical person with a   megaton thermonuclear weapon  no matter how frayed players 
nerves  it s never made a lick of sense  a combatant s megatonnage is too precious to waste on personal attacks outside the map 
it s been like this unspoken but very basic rule 
ann kittenplan is so shocked and enraged that she stands there transfixed  quivering  her sights locked on ingersoll and his
smoking rossignol  otis p  lord feels at his beanie 
ingersoll now makes a show of examining the tiny nails of his left hand and casually suggests that irlibsyr has just scored
a direct   megaton contact burst against sovwar s entire launch capacity  namely air marshal ann kittenplan  and that plus
also amnat s own launch capacity  plus both combatants  ordnance and heads of state  all lie well within the blast s kill radius
  which by ingersoll s rough calculations extends from the ivory coast to the doubles alley s senegal  unless of course that killradius is somehow altered by the possible presence of climatic snow  he adds  beaming 
pemulis and kittenplan now each let loose with a linear series of anti ingersoll invectives that drown each other out and make
the trees  crows take slow flight 
but otis lord   who s watched the exchange  ashen  and has called up something relevant on endstat s treemaster
metadecision subdirectory   now  to everyone s horror  removes from around his neck a shoelace with a little nickel colored key
and bends to the small locked so lander box on the food cart s bottom shelf and as everyone watches in horror opens the box and
with near ceremonial care exchanges the white beanie on his head for the red beanie that signifies utter global crisis  the
dreaded red ugc beanie has been donned by an eschaton game master only once before  and that was over three years ago  when
human input error on endstat tallies of aggregate sufddir during a three way sacpop free for all yielded an apparent ignition
of the earth s atmosphere 
now a real world chill descends over the grainily white swirled landscape of the nuclear theater 
pemulis tells lord he cannot believe his fucking eyes  he tells lord how dare he don the dreaded red beanie over such an
obvious instance of map not territory equivocationary horseshit as ingersoll s trying to foist 
lord  bent to the cart s blinking yushityu  responds that there seems to be a problem 
ingersoll is whistling and pretending to do the charleston between abu kemal and es suweida  using his racquet like a
hoofer s cane 
hal finally spits 
under pemulis s wild eyed stare  lord clears his throat and calls out to ingersoll  tentatively positing that today s pre game
triggering situation negotiations established no valid strategic target areas in the postage stamp sized nation of sierra leone 
ingersoll calls back across the mediterranean that target areas of keen strategic interest appeared in sierra leone at the exact
moment the heads of state and total launch capacities of amnat and sovwar took it upon themselves to traipse into sierra
leone  that sierra leone thenceforward as of that moment has  or rather had  he pretends to correct with a smile  become a de
facto sstrac  if presidents and premiers wanted to leave the protection of their territories  defense nets and hold cliquey little
other combatant excluding parleys in some hut somewhere that was up to them  but lord had been wearing the white beanie that
explicitly authorized the overexploited and underdeveloped defenders of the one true faith of the world to keep on pursuing their
strategic interests  and irlibsyr was now keenly interested in the aggregate inddir points it had coming to them for just now

 vaporizing both super combatants  strategic capacities with one flaming sword of the most high like strike 
ann kittenplan keeps taking a couple quivery steps toward ingersoll and getting restrained and pulled back by lamont chu 
 sleepy t p   peterson  who always looks a little dazed even in the best of circumstances  asks otis p  lord to define
equivocationary for him  causing hal incandenza to laugh out loud despite himself 
just outside the theater s fence  pemulis is bug eyed with fury   not impossibly  drine aggravated   and is literally jumping
up and down in one spot so hard that his yachting cap jumps slightly off his head with each impact  which troeltsch and axford
confer and agree they have previously seen occur only in animated cartoons  pemulis howls that lord is in his vacillation
appeasing ingersoll in ingersoll s effort to fatally fuck with the very breath and bread of eschaton        players themselves can t
be valid targets  players aren t inside the goddamn game  players are part of the apparatus of the game  they re part of the map  it s
snowing on the players but not on the territory  they re part of the map  not the cluster fucking territory  you can only launch
against the territory  not against the map  it s like the one ground rule boundary that keeps eschaton from degenerating into chaos 
eschaton gentlemen is about logic and axiom and mathematical probity and discipline and verity and order  you do not get points
for hitting anybody real  only the gear that maps what s real  pemulis keeps looking back over his shoulder to the pavilion and
screaming  jaysus  
ingersolps roommate j  j  penn tries to claim that the vaporized ann kittenplan is wearing several articles of gear worth
mucho inddir  and everyone tells him to shut up  the snow is now coming down hard enough to compose an environment  and
everybody outside the sheltered pavilion looks gauzily shrouded  from hal s perspective 
lord is crunching madly away at the tp under the just opened protection of an old beach umbrella a previous game master
had welded to the top of the food cart  lord wipes his nose against the same shoulder that s clamping a phone to his ear 
awkwardly  and reports he s checked the d e c  s eschaton axiom directory via pink  capable modem and that unfortunately
with all due respect to ann and mike it doesn t seem to explicitly say players with strategic functions can t become target areas if
they traipse around outside their defense nets  lamont chu says how come point values for actual players have never been
assigned  then  for pete s sake  and pemulis shouts across that that s so totally beside the point it doesn t matter  that the reason
players aren t explicitly exempted in the eschax dir is that their exemption is what makes eschaton and its axioms fucking
possible in the first place  a kind of pale boat wake of exhaust exits the idling ford sedan off behind the pavilion and widens as it
rises  dispersing  pemulis says because otherwise use your heads otherwise nonstrategic emotions would get aroused and
combatants would be whacking balls at each other s physical persons all the time and eschaton wouldn t even be possible in its
icily elegant game theoretical form  he s stopped jumping up and down  at least  troeltsch observes  players  exemption from
strikes goes without saying  pemulis says  it s like preaxiomatic  pemulis tells lord to consider what he s doing very carefully 
because from where pemulis is standing lord looks to be willing to very possibly compromise eschaton s map for all time  girls
   s    s prorector mary esther thode putts from left to right behind the pavilion on the long driveway from the circular drive to
the portcullis and halts her scooter and lifts her helmet s tinted visor and yells across for kittenplan to put a hat on if she s going to
play in the snow in a crew cut  this even though kittenplan isn t even strictly in ms  thode s like umbrella of authority  axford
observes to troeltsch  who relays this fact into his headset  hal moves his mouth around to try to gather up spit in a mouth that s
gotten rather dry  which when you have a plug of kodiak in is not very pleasant  ann kittenplan has been suffering from what
look like almost parkinsonian tremors for the last few minutes  her face writhing and her mustache almost standing right out
straight  lamont chu repeats his claim that there s no way players even with strategic functions can ever be legit target areas if no
inddir sufddir values have been entered for them in endstat s tally function  pemulis orders chu not to distract otis lord
from the incredibly potent and lethal ground lord s letting ingersoll lead them onto  he says none of them have ever even seen the
true meaning of the word crisis yet  ingersoll calls over to pemulis that his emeritus veto power is only over lord s calculations 
not over today s game s god s decisions about what s part of the game and what isn t  pemulis invites ingersoll to do something
anatomically impossible  pemulis asks lamont chu and ann kittenplan if they re just going to stand there with their thumbs in
their bottoms and let lord let ingersoll eliminate eschaton s map for keeps for one slimy cheesy victory in just one day s
apocalypse  kittenplan has been trembling and feeling at the back of her vein laced head and looking across the mediterranean at
ingersoll like somebody who knows they ll go to prison for what they want to do  axford posits certain very unlikely physical
conditions under which what pemulis told ingersoll to do to himself wouldn t be totally impossible  hal spits thickly and gathers
and tries to spit again  watching  troeltsch broadcasts the fact that there s always a queer vague vitaminish stink about mary
esther thode that he never can quite place  there s the sudden tripartite whump of three empire waste displacement vehicles
being propelled above the cloud cover to points far north  hal identifies thode s ambient odor as the stink of thiamine  which for
reasons best known to thode she takes a lot of  and troeltsch broadcasts the datum and refers to hal as a  close source   which
strikes hal as odd and somehow off in a way he can t quite name  kittenplan shakes chu s arm loose and darts over and extracts a
warhead from sovwar s portable stockpile and shouts out that well ok then if players can be targets then in that case  and she
fires a real screamer at ingersolps head  which ingersoll barely blocks with his rossignol and shrieks that kittenplan can t launch
anything at anything because she s been vaporized by a   megaton contact burst  kittenplan tells ingersoll to write his
congressman about it and over lamont chu s pleas for reasoned discussion takes several more theoretically valuable warheads out
of the industrial solvent bucket and gets truly serious about hitting ingersoll  moving steadily east across nigeria and chad  causing ingersoll to run due north across the courts  map at impressive speed  abandoning irlibsyr s ammo bucket and tear assing
up through siberia crying foul  lord s mewing ineffectually for order  but some of the other combatants  staffs have begun to
smell that evan ingersoll s become fair game for cruelty   the way kids can seem to smell this sort of thing out with such
uncanny acuity   and redchps general secretary and an am nat vector planning specialist and josh gopnik all start moving
northeast over the map firing balls as hard as they can at ingersoll  who s dropped his launcher and is shaking frantically at the
chained gate on the fence s north side  where mrs  incandenza has decided she doesn t want kids exiting the east courts and
trampling her calliopsis  and these little kids can hit balls exceptionally hard  hal is now unable to gather enough spit to spit  one
warhead hits ingersoll in the neck and another solidly in the meat of the thigh  ingersoll begins to limp around in small circles
holding his neck  crying in that slow motion shuddery way little kids have when they re crying more at the fact of being hurt than
at the hurt itself  pemulis is walking backwards away from the south fence back toward the pavilion and has both arms up in either

 appeal or fury or something else  axford tells hal and troeltsch he wishes he didn t feel the dark thrill he felt watching ingersoll
get pummeled  some filmy red peanut skin has gotten into jim struck s hair as he lies there motionless  o  p  lord attempts to rule
that ingersoll is no longer on the four courts of eschaton s earth map and so isn t even theoretically a valid target area  it doesn t
matter  several kids close in on ingersoll  triangulating their bombardment  t  peterson on point  ingersoll is hit several times 
once right near the eye  jim troeltsch is up and running to the fence wanting to stop the thing  but pemulis catches him by his
headset s cord and tells him to let them all lie in their own bed  hal  now leaning forward  steeple fingered  finds himself just
about paralyzed with absorption  trevor axford  fist to his chin  asks hal if he s ever just simply fucking hated somebody without
having any idea why  hal finds himself riveted at something about the degenerating game that seems so terribly abstract and
fraught with implications and consequences that even thinking about how to articulate it seems so complexly stressful that being
almost incapacitated with absorption is almost the only way out of the complex stress  now indpak s penn and amnat s
mckenna  who have long standing personal bones to pick with ann kittenplan  peel off and gather ordnance and execute a pincer
movement on ann kittenplan  she is hit twice from behind at close range  ingersoll has long since gone down and is still getting
hit  lord is ruling at the top of his lungs that there s no way amnat can launch against itself when he gets tagged right on the
breastbone by an errant warhead  clutching his chest with one hand  with the other he flicks the red beanie s propeller  never
before flicked  whose flicked spin heralds a worst case   utterly decontrolled armageddon type situation  timmy peterson takes
a ball in the groin and goes down like a sack of refined flour  everybody s scooping up spent warheads and totally unrealistically
refiring them  the fences shudder and sing as balls rain against them  ingersoll now resembles some sort of animal that s been run
over in the road  troeltsch  who s looking for the first time at the idling sedan by west house s dump sters and asking if anybody
knew anybody who drove a nunhagen aspirin adverting ford  is the only upperclass spectator who doesn t seem utterly silently
engrossed  ann kittenplan has dropped her racquet and is charging mckenna  she takes two contact bursts in the breast area
before she gets to him and lays mckenna out with an impressive left cross  lamont chu tackles todd possalthwaite from behind 
struck looks to have wet his pants in his sleep  j  j  penn slips on a grounded warhead near fiji and goes spectacularly down  the
snowfall makes everything gauzy and terribly clear at the same time  eliminating all visual background so that the map s action
seems stark and surreal  nobody s using tennis balls now anymore  josh gopnik punches lamont chu in the stomach  and
lamont chu yells that he s been punched in the stomach  ann kittenplan has kieran mckenna in a headlock and is punching him
repeatedly on the top of the skull  otis p  lord lets down the beach umbrella and starts pushing his crazy wheeled food cart at a
diskette rattling clip toward    s open south gate  still flicking furiously at the red beanie s propeller  struck s hair is steadily
accreting nut skins  pemulis is under cover but still standing  his legs well apart and his arms folded  the figure in the green ford
still hasn t moved once  troeltsch says he for his own part wouldn t be just sitting and lying there if any of the little buddies
under his personal charge were out there getting potentially injured  and hal reflects that he does feel a certain sort of intense
anxiety  but can t sort through the almost infinite seeming implications of what troeltsch is saying fast enough to determine
whether the anxiety is over something about what he s seeing or something in the connection between what troeltsch is saying
and the degree to which he s absorbed in what s going on out inside the fence  which is a degenerative chaos so complex in its
disorder that it s hard to tell whether it seems choreographed or simply chaotically disordered  lamont chu is throwing up into the
indian ocean  todd possalthwaite has his hands to his face and is shrieking something about his  doze   it is now  beyond any
argument or equivocation  snowing  the sky is off white  lord and his cart are now literally making tracks for the edge of the
map  evan ingersoll hasn t moved in several minutes  penn lies in a whitening service box with one leg bent beneath him at an
impossible angle  someone way off behind them has been blowing an athletic whistle  ann kittenplan begins to chase redchi s
general secretary south across the asian subcontinent at top speed  pemulis is telling hal he hates to say he told them so  hal can
see axford leaning way forward sheltering something tiny from the wind as he flicks at it with a spent lighter  it occurs to him this
is the third anniversary of axhandle losing a right finger and half his right thumb  fierce little j  gopnik is flailing at the air and
telling whoever wants it to come on  come on  otis p  lord and his cart sail clattering across indochina toward the southern gate 
hal is suddenly aware that troeltsch and pemulis are wincing but is not himself wincing and isn t sure why they are wincing and
is looking out into the fray trying to determine whether he should be wincing when redchi s general secretary  calling loudly
for his mother and in full flight as he looks over his shoulder at ann kittenplan s contorted face  barrels directly into lord s
speeding food cart  there s a noise like the historical sum of all cafeteria accidents everywhere      mb diskettes take flight like
mad bats across what uncovered would be the baseline of court     different colored beanies spill from the rolling solander box

of its rainbow s arc  it s clear lord won t make it  it s a slow motion moment  the snowfall s more than heavy enough now  hal
thinks  to excuse lord s not seeing lamont chu directly before him  on his hands and knees  throwing up  lord impacts chu s
arched form at about knee level and is spectacularly airborne  the idling ford reveals a sudden face at the driver s side window 
axford is holding the lighter s chassis up to his ear and shaking it  ann kittenplan is ramming redchi s leader s face repeatedly
into the mesh of the south fence  lord s flight s parabola is less spectacular on the y axis than the tp s has been  the yushityu s

lands on its back with its screen blinking error at the white sky  hal and everyone else can project lord s flight s own terminus
an instant before impact  for a brief moment that hal will later regard as completely and uncomfortably bizarre  hal feels at his
own face to see whether he is wincing  the distant whistle patweets  lord does indeed go headfirst down through the monitor s
screen  and stays there  his sneakers in the air and his warm up pants sagging upward to reveal black socks  there d been a bad
sound of glass  penn flails on his back  possalthwaite  ingersoll  and mckenna bleed  the second shift s     h  siren down at

 gaudeamus igitur
boston aa is jike aa nowhere else on this planet  just like aa everyplace else  boston aa is divided into numerous
individual aa groups  and each group has its particular group name like the reality group or the allston group or the clean
and sober group  and each group holds its regular meeting once a week  but almost all boston groups  meetings are speaker
meetings  that means that at the meetings there are recovering alcoholic speakers who stand up in front of everybody at an
amplified podium and  share their experience  strength  and hope         and the singular thing is that these speakers are not ever
members of the group that s holding the meeting  in boston  the speakers at one certain group s weekly speaker meeting are
always from some other certain boston aa group  the people from the other group who are here at like your group speaking are
here on something called a commitment  commitments are where some members of one group commit to hit the road and travel
to another group s meeting to speak publicly from the podium  then a bunch of people from the host group hit the opposite lane
of the same road on some other night and go to the visiting group s meeting  to speak  groups always trade commitments  you
come speak to us and we ll come speak to you  it can seem bizarre  you always go elsewhere to speak  at your own group s
meeting you re a host  you just sit there and listen as hard as you can  and you make coffee in    cup urns and stack polystyrene
cups in big ziggurats and sell raffle tickets and make sandwiches  and you empty ashtrays and scrub out urns and sweep floors
when the other group s speakers are through  you never share your experience  strength  and hope on stage behind a fiberboard
podium with its cheap nondigital pa system s mike except in front of some other metro boston group        every night in
boston  bumper stickered cars full of totally sober people  wall eyed from caffeine and trying to read illegibly scrawled directions
by the dashboard lights  crisscross the city  heading for the church basements or bingo halls or nursing home cafeterias of other
aa groups  to put on commitments  being an active member of a boston aa group is probably a little bit like being a serious
musician or like athlete  in terms of constant travel 
the white flag group of enfield ma  in metropolitan boston  meets sundays in the cafeteria of the provident nursing home
on hanneman street  off commonwealth avenue a couple blocks west of enfield tennis academy s flat topped hill  tonight the
white flag group is hosting a commitment from the advanced basics group of concord  a suburb of boston  the advanced
basics people have driven almost an hour to get here  plus there s always the problem of signless urban streets and directions
given over the phone  on this coming friday night  a small horde of white flag gers will drive out to concord to put on a
reciprocal commitment for the advanced basics group  travelling long distances on signless streets trying to parse directions
like  take the second left off the rotary by the driveway to the chiropractor s  and getting lost and shooting your whole evening
after a long day just to speak for like six minutes at a plywood podium is called  getting active with your group   the speaking
itself is known as    th step work  or  giving it away   giving it away is a cardinal boston aa principle  the term s derived
from an epigrammatic description of recovery in boston aa   you give it up to get it back to give it away   sobriety in boston is
regarded as less a gift than a sort of cosmic loan  you can t pay the loan back  but you can pay it forward  by spreading the
message that despite all appearances aa works  spreading this message to the next new guy who s tottered in to a meeting and is
sitting in the back row unable to hold his cup of coffee  the only way to hang onto sobriety is to give it away  and even just   
hours of sobriety is worth doing anything for  a sober day being nothing short of a daily miracle if you ve got the disease like he s
got the disease  says the advanced basics member who s chairing this evening s commitment  saying just a couple public words
to the hall before he opens the meeting and retires to a stool next to the podium and calls his group s speakers by random lot  the
chairperson says he didn t used to be able to go    lousy minutes without a nip  before he came in   coming in  means admitting
that your personal ass is kicked and tottering into boston aa  ready to go to any lengths to stop the shit storm  the advanced
basics chairperson looks like a perfect cross between pictures of dick cavett and truman capote       except this guy s also
like totally  almost flamboyantly bald  and to top it off he s wearing a bright black country western shirt with baroque curlicues of
white nodie piping across the chest and shoulders  and a string tie  plus sharp toed boots of some sort of weirdly imbricate reptile
skin  and overall he s riveting to look at  grotesque in that riveting way that flaunts its grotesquerie  there are more cheap metal
ashtrays and styrofoam cups in this broad hall than you ll see anywhere else ever on earth  gately s sitting right up front in the
first row  so close to the podium he can see the tailor s notch in the chairperson s outsized incisors  but he enjoys twisting around
and watching everybody come in and mill around shaking water off their outerwear  trying to find empty seats  even on the night
of the i  day holiday  the provident s cafeteria is packed by  oooh  aa does not take holidays any more than the disease does 
this is the big established sunday p m  meeting for aas in enfield and allston and brighton  regulars come every week from
watertown and east newton  too  often  unless they re out on commitments with their own groups  the provident cafeteria walls 
painted an indecisive green  are tonight bedecked with portable felt banners emblazoned with aa slogans in cub scoutish blue
and gold  the slogans on them appear way too insipid even to mention what they are  e g   one day at a time   for one  the
effete western dressed guy concludes his opening exhortation  leads the opening moment of silence  reads the aa preamble  pulls
a random name out of the crested beaut cowboy hat he s holding  makes a squinty show of reading it  says he d like to call
advanced basics  first random speaker of the evening  and asks if his fellow group member john l  is in the house  here  tonight 
john l  gets up to the podium and says   that is a question i did not used to be able to answer   this gets a laugh  and everybody s
posture gets subtly more relaxed  because it s clear that john l  has some sober time in and isn t going to be one of those aa
speakers who s so wracked with self conscious nerves he makes the empathetic audience nervous too  everybody in the audience
is aiming for total empathy with the speaker  that way they ll be able to receive the aa message he s here to carry  empathy  in
boston aa  is called identification 
then john l  says his first name and what he is  and everybody calls hello 
white flag is one of the area aa meetings ennet house requires its residents to attend  you have to be seen at a designated
aa or na meeting every single night of the week or out you go  discharged  a house staff member has to accompany the
residents when they go to the designated meetings  so they can be officially seen there      the residents  house counselors
suggest that they sit right up at the front of the hall where they can see the pores in the speaker s nose and try to identify instead of
compare  again  identify means empathize  identifying  unless you ve got a stake in comparing  isn t very hard to do  here 
because if you sit up front and listen hard  all the speakers  stories of decline and fall and surrender are basically alike  and like
your own  fun with the substance  then very gradually less fun  then significantly less fun because of like blackouts you suddenly

 come out of on the highway going     kph with companions you do not know  nights you awake from in unfamiliar bedding next
to somebody who doesn t even resemble any known sort of mammal  three day blackouts you come out of and have to buy a
newspaper to even know what town you re in  yes gradually less and less actual fun but with some physical need for the
substance  now  instead of the former voluntary fun  then at some point suddenly just very little fun at all  combined with terrible
daily hand trembling need  then dread  anxiety  irrational phobias  dim siren like memories of fun  trouble with assorted
authorities  knee buckling headaches  mild seizures  and the litany of what boston aa calls losses  
 then come the day i lost my job to drinking   concord s john l  has a huge hanging gut and just no ass at all  the way some
big older guys  asses seem to get sucked into their body and reappear out front as gut  gately  in sobriety  does nightly sit ups out
of fear this    all of a sudden happen to him  as age thirty approaches  gately is so huge no one sits behind him for several rows 
john l  has the biggest bunch of keys gately s ever seen  they re on one of those pull outable wire janitor s keychains that clips to
a belt loop  and the speaker jangles them absently  unaware  his one tip of the hat to public nerves  he s also wearing gray janitor s
pants   lost my damn job   he says   i mean to say i still knew where it was and whatnot  i just went in as usual one day and there
was some other fellow doing it   which gets another laugh 
  then more losses  with the substance seeming like the only consolation against the pain of the mounting losses  and of
course you re in denial about it being the substance that s causing the very losses it s consoling you about  
 alcohol destroys slowly but thoroughly is what a fellow said to me the first night i come in  up in concord  and that fellow
ended up becoming my sponsor  
  then less mild seizures  d t s during attempts to taper off too fast  introduction to subjective bugs and rodents  then one
more binge and more formicative bugs  then eventually a terrible acknowledgment that some line has been undeniably crossed 
and fist at the sky  as god is my witness vows to buckle down and lick this thing for good  to quit for all time  then maybe a few
white knuckled days of initial success  then a slip  then more pledges  clock watching  baroque self regulations  repeated slips
back into the substance s relief after like two days  abstinence  ghastly hangovers  head flattening guilt and self disgust 
superstructures of additional self regulations  e g  not before o ooh  not on a worknight  only when the moon is waxing  only in
the company of swedes  which also fail  
 when i was drunk i wanted to get sober and when i was sober i wanted to get drunk   john l  says   i lived that way for years 
and i submit to you that s not livin  that s a fuckin death in life  
  then unbelievable psychic pain  a kind of peritonitis of the soul  psychic agony  fear of impending insanity  why can t i
quit if i so want to quit  unless i m insane    appearances at hospital detoxes and rehabs  domestic strife  financial free fall 
eventual domestic losses  
 and then i lost my wife to drinking  i mean i still knew where she was and whatnot  i just went in one day and there was
some other fellow doing it   at which there s not all that much laughter  lots of pained nods  it s often the same all over  in terms of
domestic losses 
  then vocational ultimatums  unemployability  financial ruin  pancreatitis  overwhelming guilt  bloody vomiting  cirrhotic
neuralgia  incontinence  neuropathy  nephritis  black depressions  searing pain  with the substance affording increasingly brief
periods of relief  then  finally  no relief available anywhere at all  finally it s impossible to get high enough to freeze what you feel
like  being this way  and now you hate the substance  bate it  but you stijl find yourself unable to stop doing it  the substance  you
find you finally want to stop more than anything on earth and it s no fun doing it anymore and you can t believe you ever liked
doing it and but you still can t stop  it s like you re totally fucking bats  it s like there s two yous  and when you d sell your own
dear mum to stop and still  you find  can t stop  then the last layer of jolly friendly mask comes off your old friend the substance 
it s midnight now and all masks come off  and you all of a sudden see the substance as it really is  for the first time you see the
disease as it really is  really has been all this time  you look in the mirror at midnight and see what owns you  what s become what
you are  
 a fuckin livin death  i tell you it s not being near alive  by the end i was undead  not alive  and i tell you the idea of dyin was
nothing compared to the idea of livin like that for another five or ten years and only then dyin   with audience heads nodding in
rows like a wind swept meadow  boy can they ever identify 
  and then you re in serious trouble  very serious trouble  and you know it  finally  deadly serious trouble  because this
substance you thought was your one true friend  that you gave up all for  gladly  that for so long gave you relief from the pain of
the losses your love of that relief caused  your mother and lover and god and compadre  has finally removed its smily face mask
to reveal centerless eyes and a ravening maw  and canines down to here  it s the face in the floor  the grinning root white face of
your worst nightmares  and the face is your own face in the mirror  now  it s you  the substance has devoured or replaced and
become you  and the puke   drool and substance crusted t shirt you ve both worn for weeks now gets torn off and you stand there
looking and in the root white chest where your heart  given away to it  should be beating  in its exposed chest s center and centerless eyes is just a lightless hole  more teeth  and a beckoning taloned hand dangling something irresistible  and now you see you ve
been had  screwed royal  stripped and fucked and tossed to the side like some stuffed toy to lie for all time in the posture you land
in  you see now that it s your enemy and your worst personal nightmare and the trouble it s gotten you into is undeniable and you
still can t stop  doing the substance now is like attending black mass but you still can t stop  even though the substance no longer
gets you high  you are  as they say  finished  you cannot get drunk and you cannot get sober  you cannot get high and you cannot
get straight  you are behind bars  you are in a cage and can see only bars in every direction  you are in the kind of a hell of a mess
that either ends lives or turns them around  you are at a fork in the road that boston aa calls your bottom  though the term is
misleading  because everybody here agrees it s more like someplace very high and unsupported  you re on the edge of something
tall and leaning way out forward    
if you listen for the similarities  all these speakers  substance careers seem to terminate at the same cliff s edge  you are now
finished  as a substance user  it s the jumping off place  you now have two choices  you can either eliminate your own map for
keeps   blades are the best  or else pills  or there s always quietly sucking off the exhaust pipe of your re possessable car in the
bank owned garage of your familyless home  something whimpery instead of banging  better clean and quiet and  since your
whole career s been one long futile flight from pain  painless  though of the alcoholics and drug addicts who compose over    

 of a given year s suicides  some try to go out with a last great garish balaclavan gesture  one longtime member of the white flag
group is a prognathous lady named louise b  who tried to take a map eliminating dive off the old hancock building downtown
in b s      but got caught in the gust of a rising thermal only six flights off the roof and got blown cartwheeling back up and in
through the smoked glass window of an arbitrage firm s suite on the thirty fourth floor  ending up sprawled prone on a high gloss
conference table with only lacerations and a compound of the collarbone and an experience of willed self annihilation and
external intervention that has left her rabidly christian   rabidly  as in foam   so that she s comparatively ignored and avoided 
though her aa story  being just like everybody else s but more spectacular  has become metro boston aa myth  but so when you
get to this jumping off place at the finish of your substance career you can either take up the luger or blade and eliminate your
own personal map   this can be at age sixty  or twenty seven  or seventeen   or you can get out the very beginning of the
yellow pages or internet psych svce file and make a blubbering o ooh  phone call and admit to a gentle grandparentish voice
that you re in trouble  deadly serious trouble  and the voice will try to soothe you into hanging on until a couple hours go by and
two pleasantly earnest  weirdly calm guys in conservative attire appear smiling at your door sometime before dawn and speak
quietly to you for hours and leave you not remembering anything from what they said except the sense that they used to be eerily
like you  just where you are  utterly fucked  and but now somehow aren t anymore  fucked like you  at least they didn t seem like
they were  unless the whole thing s some incredibly involved scam  this aa thing  and so but anyway you sit there on what s left
of your furniture in the lavender dawnlight and realize that by now you literally have no other choices besides trying this aa thing
or else eliminating your map  so you spend the day killing every last bit of every substance you ve got in one last joyless bitter
farewell binge and resolve  the next day  to go ahead and swallow your pride and maybe your common sense too and try these
meetings of this  program  that at best is probably just unitarian happy horseshit and at worst is a cover for some glazed and canny
cult type thing where they ll keep you sober by making you spend twenty hours a day selling cellophane cones of artificial flowers
on the median strips of heavy flow roads  and what defines this cliffish nexus of exactly two total choices  this miserable roadfork boston aa calls your bottom  is that at this point you feel like maybe selling flowers on median strips might not be so bad 
not compared to what you ve got going  personally  at this juncture  and this  at root  is what unites boston aa  it turns out this
same resigned  miserable  brainwash and exploit me if that s what it takes type desperation has been the jumping off place for
just about every aa you meet  it emerges  once you ve actually gotten it up to stop darting in and out of the big meetings and start
walking up with your wet hand out and trying to actually personally meet some boston aas  as the one particular tough old guy
or lady you re always particularly scared of and drawn to says  nobody ever comes in because things were going really well and
they just wanted to round out their p m  social calendar  everybody  but everybody comes in dead eyed and puke white and with
their face hanging down around their knees and with a well thumbed firearm and ordnance mail order catalogue kept safe and
available at home  map wise  for when this last desperate resort of hugs and cliches turns out to be just happy horseshit  for you 
you are not unique  they ll say  this initial hopelessness unites every soul in this broad cold salad bar d hall  they are like
hindenburg survivors  every meeting is a reunion  once you ve been in for a while 
and then the palsied newcomers who totter in desperate and miserable enough to hang in and keep coming and start feebly to
scratch beneath the unlikely insipid surface of the thing  don gately s found  then get united by a second common experience  the
shocking discovery that the thing actually does seem to work  does keep you substance free  it s improbable and shocking  when
gately finally snapped to the fact  one day about four months into his ennet house residency  that quite a few days seemed to
have gone by without his playing with the usual idea of slipping over to unit    and getting loaded in some nonuremic way the
courts couldn t prove  that several days had gone without his even thinking of oral narcotics or a tightly rolled dubois or a cold
foamer on a hot day     when he realized that the various substances he didn t used to be able to go a day without absorbing hadn t
even like occurred to him in almost a week  gately hadn t felt so much grateful or joyful as just plain shocked  the idea that aa
might actually somehow work unnerved him  he suspected some sort of trap  some new sort of trap  at this stage he and the other
ennet residents who were still there and starting to snap to the fact that aa might work began to sit around together late at night
going batshit together because it seemed to be impossible to figure out just how aa worked  it did  yes  tentatively seem maybe
actually to be working  but gately couldn t for the life of him figure out how just sitting on hemorrhoid hostile folding chairs
every night looking at nose pores and listening to cliches could work  nobody s ever been able to figure a a out  is another
binding commonality  and the folks with serious time in aa are infuriating about questions starting with how  you ask the scary
old guys how aa works and they smile their chilly smiles and say just fine  it just works  is all  end of story  the newcomers
who abandon common sense and resolve to hang in and keep coming and then find their cages all of a sudden open  mysteriously 
after a while  share this sense of deep shock and possible trap  about newer boston aas with like six months clean you can see
this look of glazed suspicion instead of beatific glee  an expression like that of bug eyed natives confronted suddenly with a zippo
lighter  and so this unites them  nervously  this tentative assemblage of possible glimmers of something like hope  this grudging
move toward maybe acknowledging that this unromantic  unhip  cliched aa thing   so unlikely and unpromising  so much the
inverse of what they d come too much to love   might really be able to keep the lover s toothy maw at bay  the process is the
neat reverse of what brought you down and in here  substances start out being so magically great  so much the interior jigsaw s
missing piece  that at the start you just know  deep in your gut  that they ll never let you down  you just know it  but they do  and
then this goofy slapdash anarchic system of low rent gatherings and corny slogans and saccharin grins and hideous coffee is so
lame you just know there s no way it could ever possibly work except for the utterest morons       and then gately seems to find
out aa turns out to be the very loyal friend he thought he d had and then lost  when you came in  and so you hang in and stay
sober and straight  and out of sheer hand burned on hot stove terror you heed the improbable sounding warnings not to stop
pounding out the nightly meetings even after the substance cravings have left and you feel like you ve got a grip on the thing at
last and can now go it alone  you still don t try to go it alone  you heed the improbable warnings because by now you have no faith
in your own sense of what s really improbable and what isn t  since aa seems  improbably enough  to be working  and with no
faith in your own senses you re confused  flummoxed  and when people with aa time strongly advise you to keep coming you
nod robotically and keep coming  and you sweep floors and scrub out ashtrays and fill stained steel urns with hideous coffee  and
you keep getting ritually down on your big knees every morning and night asking for help from a sky that still seems a burnished
shield against all who would ask aid of it   how can you pray to a  god  you believe only morons believe in  still    but the old

 guys say it doesn t yet matter what you believe or don t believe  just do it they say  and like a shock trained organism without any
kind of independent human will you do exactly like you re told  you keep coming and coming  nightly  and now you take pains not
to get booted out of the squalid halfway house you d at first tried so hard to get discharged from  you hang in and hang in 
meeting after meeting  warm day after cold day      and not only does the urge to get high stay more or less away  but more general
life quality type things   just as improbably promised  at first  when you d come in   things seem to get progressively
somehow better  inside  for a while  then worse  then even better  then for a while worse in a way that s still somehow better 
realer  you feel weirdly unblinded  which is good  even though a lot of the things you now see about yourself and how you ve
lived are horrible to have to see   and by this time the whole thing is so improbable and unparsable that you re so flummoxed
you re convinced you re maybe brain damaged  still  at this point  from all the years of substances  and you figure you d better
hang in in this boston aa where older guys who seem to be less damaged   or at least less flummoxed by their damage   will
tell you in terse simple imperative clauses exactly what to do  and where and when to do it  though never how or why   and at
this point you ve started to have an almost classic sort of blind faith in the older guys  a blind faith in them born not of zealotry
or even belief but just of a chilled conviction that you have no faith whatsoever left in yourself      and now if the older guys say
jump you ask them to hold their hand at the desired height  and now they ve got you  and you re free 
another advanced basics group speaker  whose first name gately loses in the crowd s big hello but whose last initial is e  
an even bigger guy than john l   a green card irishman in a skallycap and sinn fein sweatshirt  with a belly like a swinging sack
of meal and a thoroughly visible ass to back it up  is sharing his hope s experience by listing the gifts that have followed his
decision to come in and put the plug in the jug and the cap on the phentermine hydrochloride bottle     and stop driving longhaul truck routes in unbroken    hour metal pedalled states of chemical psychosis  the rewards of his abstinence  he stresses 
have been more than just spiritual  only in boston a a can you hear a fifty year old immigrant wax lyrical about his first solid
bowel movement in adult life

throughout  gately and the other white flaggers fall about  laugh from the gut  a turd that practically had a pulse  an ode to a solid
dump  but the lightless eyes of certain palsied back row newcomers widen with a very private identification and possible hope 
hardly daring to imagine      a certain message has been carried 
gately s biggest asset as an ennet house live in staffer   besides the size thing  which is not to be discounted when order
has to be maintained in a place where guys come in fresh from detox still in withdrawal with their eyes rolling like palsied cattle
and an earring in their eyelid and a tattoo that says born to be unpleasant   besides the fact that his upper arms are the
size of cuts of beef you rarely see off hooks  his big plus is he has this ability to convey his own experience about at first hating
aa to new house residents who hate aa and resent being forced to go and sit up in nose pore range and listen to such limply
improbable cliched drivel night after night  limp aa looks  at first  and actually limp it sometimes really is  gately tells the new
residents  and he says no way he d expect them to believe on just his say so that the thing ll work if they re miserable and
desperate enough to hang in against common sense for a while  but he says he ll clue them in on a truly great thing about aa 
they can t kick you out  you re in if you say you re in  nobody can get kicked out  not for any reason  which means you can say
anything in here  talk about solid turds all you want  the molecular integrity of shit is small potatoes  gately says he defies the
new ennet house residents to try and shock the smiles off these boston aas  faces  can t be done  he says  these folks have
literally heard it all  enuresis  impotence  priapism  onanism  projectile incontinence  autocastration  elaborate paranoid
delusions  the grandiosest megalomania  communism  fringe birchism  national socialist bundism  psychotic breaks  sodomy 
bestiality  daughter diddling  exposures at every conceivable level of indecency  coprophilia and  phagia  four year white
flagger glenn k  s personally chosen higher power is satan  for fuck s sake  granted  nobody in white flag much likes glenn k  
and the thing with the hooded cape and makeup and the candelabrum he carries around draw some mutters  but glenn k  is a
member for exactly as long as he cares to hang in 
so say anything you want  gately invites them  go to the beginner meeting at    oh  and raise your shaky mitt and tell the
unlacquered truth  free associate  run with it  gately this morning  just after required a m  meditation  gately was telling the
tatt obsessed little new lawyer guy ewell  with the hypertensive flush and little white beard  telling him how he  gately  had
perked up considerably at    days clean when he found he could raise his big mitt in beginner meetings and say publicly just how
much he hates this limp aa drivel about gratitude and humility and miracles and how he hates it and thinks it s horseshit and hates
the aas and how they all seem like limp smug moronic self satisfied shit eating pricks with their lobotomized smiles and goopy
sentiment and how he wishes them all violent technicolor harm in the worst way  new gately sitting there spraying vitriol  wetlipped and red eared  trying to get kicked out  purposely trying to outrage the aas into giving him the boot so he could quickmarch back to ennet house and tell crippled pat montesian and his counselor gene m  how he d been given the boot at aa  how
they d pleaded for honest sharing of innermost feelings and ok he d honestly shared his deepest feelings on the matter of them
and the grinning hypocrites had shaken their fists and told him to screw       and but so in the meetings the poison would leap and
spurt from him  and how but he found out all that these veteran white flaggers would do as a group when he like vocally wished
them harm was nod furiously in empathetic identification and shout with maddening cheer  keep coming   and one or two
flaggers with medium amounts of sober time would come up to him after the meeting and say how it was so good to hear him

 share and holy mackerel could they ever identify with the deeply honest feelings he d shared and how he d done them the service
of giving them the gift of a real  remember when  type experience because they could now remember feeling just exactly the
same way as gately  when they first came in  only they confess not then having the spine to honestly share it with the group  and
so in a bizarre improbable twist they d have gately ending up standing there feeling like some sort of aa hero  a prodigy of
vitriolic spine  both frustrated and elated  and before they bid him orevwar and told him to come back they d make sure to give
him their phone numbers on the back of their little raffle tickets  phone numbers gately wouldn t dream of actually calling up  to
say what  for chrissakes   but which he found he rather liked having in his wallet  to just carry around  just in case of who knew
what  and then plus maybe one of these old enfield native white flag guys with geologic amounts of sober time in aa and a
twisted ruined old body and clear bright white eyes would hobble sideways like a crab slowly up to gately after a meeting in
which he d spewed vitriol and reach way up to clap him on his big sweaty shoulder and say in their fremitic smoker s croak that
well you at least seem like a ballsy little bastard  all full of piss and vinegar and whatnot  and that just maybe you ll be ok  don
g   just maybe  just keep coming  and  if you d care for a spot of advice from somebody who likely spilled more booze in his day
than you ve even consumed in yours  you might try to just simply sit down at meetings and relax and take the cotton out of your
ears and put it in your mouth and shut the fuck up and just listen  for the first time perhaps in your life really listen  and maybe
you ll end up ok  and they don t offer their phone numbers  not the really old guys  gately knows he d have to eat his pride raw
and actually request the numbers of the old ruined grim calm longtimers in white flag   the crocodiles  the less senior white
flaggers call them  because the old twisted guys all tend to sit clustered together with hideous turd like cigars in one corner of the
provident cafeteria under a    x    framed glossy of crocodiles or alligators sunning themselves on some verdant riverbank
somewhere  with the maybe joke legend old timers corner somebody had magisculed across the bottom of the photo  and
these old guys cluster together under it  rotating their green cigars in their misshapen fingers and discussing completely
mysterious long sober matters out of the sides of their mouths  gately sort of fears these old aa guys with their varicose noses
and flannel shirts and white crew cuts and brown teeth and coolly amused looks of appraisal  feels like a kind of low rank tribal
knucklehead in the presence of stone faced chieftains who rule by some unspoken shamanistic fiat      and so of course he hates
them  the crocodiles  for making him feel like he fears them  but oddly he also ends up looking forward a little to sitting in the
same big nursing home cafeteria with them and facing the same direction they face  every sunday  and a little later finds he even
enjoys riding at    kph tops in their perfectly maintained    year old sedans when he starts going along on white flag
commitments to other boston aa groups  he eventually heeds a terse suggestion and starts going out and telling his grisly personal story publicly from the podium with other members of white flag  the group he gave in and finally officially joined  this is
what you do if you re new and have what s called the gift of desperation and are willing to go to any excruciating lengths to stay
straight  you officially join a group and put your name and sobriety date down on the group secretary s official roster  and you
make it your business to start to get to know other members of the group on a personal basis  and you carry their numbers
talismanically in your wallet  and  most important  you get active with your group  which here in gately s boston aa active
means not just sweeping the footprinty floor after the lord s prayer and making coffee and emptying ashtrays of gasper butts and
ghastly spit wet cigar ends but also showing up regularly at specified p m  times at the white flag group s regular haunt  the elit
 the final e s neon s ballast s out  diner next to steve s donuts in enfield center  showing up and pounding down tooth loosening
amounts of coffee and then getting in well maintained crocodilian sedans whose suspensions  springs gately s mass makes sag
and getting driven  wall eyed with caffeine and cigar fumes and general public speaking angst  to like lowell s joy of living
group or charlestown s plug in the jug group or bridgewater state detox or concord honor farm with these guys  and except
for one or two other pale wall eyed newcomers with the gift of utter desperation it s mostly crocodiles with geologic sober time
in these cars  it s mostly the guys that ve stayed sober in white flag for decades who still go on every single booked commitment 
they go every time  dependable as death  even when the celtics are on spontaneous dis they hit the old commitment trail  they
remain rabidly active with their group  and the crocodiles in the car invite gately to see the coincidence of long term contented
sobriety and rabidly tireless aa activity as not a coincidence at all  the backs of their necks are complexly creased  the
crocodiles up front look into the rearview mirror and narrow their baggy bright white eyes at gately in the sagging backseat with
the other new guys  and the crocodiles say they can t even begin to say how many new guys they ve seen come in and then get
sucked back out there  come in to aa for a while and hang in and put together a little sober time and have things start to get
better  head wise and life quality wise  and after a while the new guys get cocky  they decide they ve gotten  well   and they get
really busy at the new job sobriety s allowed them to get  or maybe they buy season celtics tickets  or they rediscover pussy and
start chasing pussy  these withered gnarled toothless totally post sexual old fuckers actually say pussy   but one way or another
these poor cocky clueless new bastards start gradually drifting away from rabid activity in the group  and then away from their
group itself  and then little by little gradually drift away from any aa meetings at all  and then  without the protection of
meetings or a group  in time   oh there s always plenty of time  the disease is fiendishly patient   how in time they forget what
it was like  the ones that ve cockily drifted  they forget who and what they are  they forget about the disease  until like one day
they re at like maybe a celtics sixers game  and the good old fleet first interstate center s hot  and they think what could just one
cold foamer hurt  after all this sober time  now that they ve gotten  well   just one cold one  what could it hurt  and after that one
it s like they d never stopped  if they ve got the disease  and how in a month or six months or a year they have to come back in 
back to the boston aa halls and their old group  tottering  d t ing  with their faces hanging down around their knees all over
again  or maybe it s five or ten years before they can get it up to get back in  beaten to shit again  or else their system isn t ready
for the recurred abuse again after some sober time and they die out there   the crocodiles are always talking in hushed   namlike tones about out there   or else  worse  maybe they kill somebody in a blackout and spend the rest of their lives in mciwalpole drinking raisin jack fermented in the seatless toilet and trying to recall what they did to get in there  out there  or else 
worst of all  these cocky new guys drift back out there and have nothing sufficiently horrible to finish them happen at all  just go
back to drinking           to not living  behind bars  undead  back in the disease s cage all over again  the crocodiles talk about
how they can t count the number of guys that ve come in for a while and drifted away and gone back out there and died  or not
gotten to die  they even point some of these guys out   gaunt gray spectral men reeling on sidewalks with all that they own in a
trashbag   as the white flaggers drive slowly by in their well maintained cars  old emphysemic francis g  in particular likes to

 slow his lesabre down at a corner in front of some jack legged loose faced homeless fuck who d once been in aa and drifted
cockily out and roll down his window and yell  live it up  
of course   the crocodiles dig at each other with their knobby elbows and guffaw and wheeze   they say when they tell
gately to either hang in aa and get rabidly active or else die in slime of course it s only a suggestion  they howl and choke and
slap their knees at this  it s your classic in type joke  there are  by ratified tradition  no  musts  in boston aa  no doctrine or
dogma or rules  they can t kick you out  you don t have to do what they say  do exactly as you please   if you still trust what
seems to please you  the crocodiles roar and wheeze and pound on the dash and bob in the front seat in abject aa mirth 
boston aa s take on itself is that it s a benign anarchy  that any order to the thing is a function of miracle  no regs  no musts 
only love and support and the occasional humble suggestion born of shared experience  a non authoritarian  dogma free
movement  normally a gifted cynic  with a keen bullshit antenna  gately needed over a year to pinpoint the ways in which he
feels like boston aa really is actually sub rosa dogmatic  you re not supposed to pick up any sort of altering substance  of
course  that goes without saying  but the fellowship s official line is that if you do slip or drift or fuck up or forget and go out
there for a night and absorb a substance and get all your disease s triggers pulled again they want you to know they not only
invite but urge you to come on back to meetings as quickly as possible  they re pretty sincere about this  since a lot of new people
slip and slide a bit  total abstinence wise  in the beginning  nobody s supposed to judge you or snub you for slipping  everybody s
here to help  everybody knows that the returning slippee has punished himself enough just being out there  and that it takes
incredible desperation and humility to eat your pride and wobble back in and put the substance down again after you ve fucked up
the first time and the substance is calling to you all over again  there s the sort of sincere compassion about fucking up that
empathy makes possible  although some of the aas will nod smugly when they find out the slippee didn t take some of the basic
suggestions  even newcomers who can t even start to quit yet and show up with suspicious flask sized bulges in their coat pockets
and list progressively to starboard as the meeting progresses are urged to keep coming  hang in  stay  as long as they re not too
disruptive  inebriates are discouraged from driving themselves home after the lord s prayer  but nobody s going to wrestle your
keys away  boston aa stresses the utter autonomy of the individual member  please say and do whatever you wish  of course
there are about a dozen basic suggestions      and of course people who cockily decide they don t wish to abide by the basic
suggestions are constantly going back out there and then wobbling back in with their faces around their knees and confessing
from the podium that they didn t take the suggestions and have paid full price for their willful arrogance and have learned the hard
way and but now they re back  by god  and this time they re going to follow the suggestions to the bloody letter just see if they
don t  gately s sponsor francis   ferocious francis   g   the crocodile that gately finally got up the juice to ask to be his sponsor 
compares the totally optional basic suggestions in boston aa to  say for instance if you re going to jump out of an airplane  they
 suggest  you wear a parachute  but of course you do what you want  then he starts laughing until he s coughing so bad he has to
sit down 
the bitch of the thing is you have to want to  if you don t want to do as you re told   i mean as it s suggested you do   it
means that your own personal will is still in control  and eugenio martinez over at ennet house never tires of pointing out that
your personal will is the web your disease sits and spins in  still  the will you call your own ceased to be yours as of who knows
how many substance drenched years ago  it s now shot through with the spidered fibrosis of your disease  his own experience s
term for the disease is  the spider      you have to starve the spider  you have to surrender your will  this is why most people
will come in and hang in only after their own entangled will has just about killed them  you have to want to surrender your will
to people who know how to starve the spider  you have to want to take the suggestions  want to abide by the traditions of
anonymity  humility  surrender to the group conscience  if you don t obey  nobody will kick you out  they won t have to  you ll
end up kicking yourself out  if you steer by your own sick will  this is maybe why just about everybody in the white flag group
tries so hard to be so disgustingly humble  kind  helpful  tactful  cheerful  nonjudgmental  tidy  energetic  sanguine  modest 
generous  fair  orderly  patient  tolerant  attentive  truthful  it isn t like the group makes them do it  it s more like that the only
people who end up able to hang for serious time in aa are the ones who willingly try to be these things  this is why  to the
cynical newcomer or fresh ennet house resident  serious aas look like these weird combinations of gandhi and mr  rogers with
tattoos and enlarged livers and no teeth who used to beat wives and diddle daughters and now rhapsodize about their bowel
movements  it s all optional  do it or die 
so but like e g  gately puzzled for quite some time about why these aa meetings where nobody kept order seemed so
orderly  no interrupting  fist icuffery  no heckled invectives  no poisonous gossip or beefs over the tray s last oreo  where was the
hard ass sergeant at arms who enforced these principles they guaranteed would save your ass  pat montesian and eugenio
martinez and ferocious francis the crocodile wouldn t answer gately s questions about where s the enforcement  they just all
smiled coy smiles and said to keep coming  an apothegm gately found just as trite as  easy does it    live and let live  
how do trite things get to be trite  why is the truth usually not just un but anti interesting  because every one of the seminal
little mini epiphanies you have in early aa is always polyesterishly banal  gately admits to residents  he ll tell how  as a resident 
right after that one harvard square industrial grunge post punk  this guy whose name was bernard but insisted on being called
plasmatron    right after old plasmatron   drank nine bottles of nyquil in the men s upstairs head and pitched forward face first
into his instant spuds at supper and got discharged on the spot  and got fireman carried by calvin thrust right out to comm 
ave  s green line t stop  and gately got moved up from the newest guys    man room to take plas matron   s old bunk in the
less new guys    man room  gately had an epi phanic aa related nocturnal dream he ll be the first to admit was banally trite     
in the dream gately and row after row of totally average and non unique u s  citizens were kneeling on their knees on polyester
cushions in a crummy low rent church basement  the basement was your average low rent church basement except for this
dream church s basement walls were of like this weird thin clean clear glass  everybody was kneeling on these cheap but
comfortable cushions  and it was weird because nobody seemed to have any clear idea why they were all on their knees  and there
was like no tier boss or sergeant at arms type figure around coercing them into kneeling  and yet there was this sense of some
compelling unspoken reason why they were all kneeling  it was one of those dream things where it didn t make sense but did  and
but then some lady over to gately s left got off her knees and all of a sudden stood up  just like to stretch  and the minute she stood
up she was all of a sudden yanked backward with terrible force and sucked out through one of the clear glass walls of the

 basement  and gately had winced to get ready for the sound of serious glass  but the glass wall didn t shatter so much as just let
the cartwheeling lady sort of melt right through  and healed back over where she d melted through  and she was gone  her cushion
and then gately notices a couple other polyester cushions in some of the rows here and there were empty  and it was then  as he
was looking around  that gately in his dream looked slowly up overhead at the ceiling s exposed pipes and could now all of a
sudden see  rotating slow and silent through the basement a meter above the different shaped and  colored heads of the kneeling
assembly  he could see a long plain hooked stick  like the crook of a giant shepherd  like the hook that appears from stage left and
drags bad acts out of tomato range  moving slowly above them in french curled circles  almost demurely  as if quietly scanning 
and when a mild faced guy in a cardigan happened to stand up and was hooked by the hooked stick and pulled ass over teakettle
out through the soundless glass membrane gately turned his big head as far as he could without leaving the cushion and could see 
now  just outside the wall s clean pane  trolling with the big stick  an extraordinarily snappily dressed and authoritative figure
manipulating the giant shepherd s crook with one hand and coolly examining the nails of his other hand from behind a mask that
was simply the plain yellow smily face circle that accompanied invitations to have a nice day  the figure was so impressive and
trustworthy and casually self assured as to be both soothing and compelling  the authoritative figure radiated good cheer and
abundant charm and limitless patience  it manipulated the big stick in the coolly purposeful way of the sort of angler who you
know isn t going to throw back anything he catches  the slow silent stick with the hook he held was what kept them all kneeling
below the baroque little circumferences of its movement overhead 
one of ennet house s live in staffers  rotating p m  jobs is to be awake and on call in the front office all night for dream
duty   people in early recovery from substances often get hit with real horror show dreams  or else traumatically seductive
substance dreams  and sometimes trite but important epiphanic dreams  and the staffer on dream duty is required to be up doing
paperwork or sit ups or staring out the broad bay window in the front office downstairs  ready to make coffee and listen to the
residents  dreams and offer the odd practical upbeat boston aa type insight into possible implications for the dreamer s progress
in recovery   but gately had no need to clomp downstairs for a staffer s feedback on this one  since it was so powerfully  tritely
obvious  it had come clear to gately that boston aa had the planet s most remorselessly hard ass and efficient sergeant at arms 
gately lay there  overhanging all four sides of his bunk  his broad square forehead beaded with revelation  boston aa s sergeant
at arms stood outside the orderly meeting halls  in that much invoked out there where exciting clubs full of good cheer throbbed
gaily below lit signs with neon bottles endlessly pouring  aa s patient enforcer was always and everywhere out there  it stood
casually checking its cuticles in the astringent fluorescence of pharmacies that took forged talwin scrips for a hefty surcharge  in
the onionlight through paper shades in the furnished rooms of strung out nurses who financed their own cages  maintenance with
stolen pharmaceutical samples  in the isopropyl reek of the storefront offices of stooped old chain smoking md s whose scrippads were always out and who needed only to hear  pain  and see cash  in the home of a snot strangled canadian vip and the
office of an implacable revere a d a  whose wife has opted for dentures at thirty five  aa s disciplinarian looked damn good and
smelled even better and dressed to impress and his blank black on yellow smile never faltered as he sincerely urged you to have a
nice day  just one more last nice day  just one 
and that was the first night that cynical gately willingly took the basic suggestion to get down on his big knees by his
undersized spring shot ennet house bunk and ask for help from something he still didn t believe in  ask for his own sick spiderbit will to be taken from him and fumigated and squished 
but and plus in boston aa there is  unfortunately  dogma  too  it turns out  and some of it is both dated and smug  and there s
an off putting jargon in the fellowship  a psychobabbly dialect that s damn near impossible to follow at first  says ken erdedy  the
college boy ad exec semi new at ennet house  complaining to gately at the white flag meeting s raffle break  boston aa
meetings are unusually long  an hour and a half instead of the national hour  but here they also have this formal break at about   
minutes where everybody can grab a sandwich or oreo and a sixth cup of coffee and stand around and chat  and bond  where
people can pull their sponsors aside and confide some trite insight or emotional snafu that the sponsor can swiftly  privately
validate but also place in the larger imperative context of the primary need not to absorb a substance today  just today  no matter
what happens  while everybody s bonding and interfacing in a bizarre system of catchphrases  there s also the raffle  another
boston idiosyncrasy  the newest of the white flag newcomers trying to get active in group service wobble around with rattan
baskets and packs of tickets  one for a buck and three for a fin  and the winner eventually gets announced from the podium and
everyone hisses and shouts  fix   and laughs  and the winner wins a big book or an as bill sees it or a came to believe  which if
he s got some sober time in and already owns all the aa literature from winning previous raffles he ll stand up and publicly offer
it to any newcomer who wants it  which means any newcomer with enough humble desperation to come up to him and ask for it
and risk being given a phone number to carry around in his wallet 
at the white flag raffle break gately usually stands around chainsmoking with the ennet house residents  so that he s
casually available to answer questions and empathize with complaints  he usually waits til after the meeting to do his own
complaining to ferocious francis  with whom gately now shares the important duty of  breaking down the hall   sweeping floors
and emptying ashtrays and wiping down the long cafeteria tables  which f f g  s function is limited because he s on oxygen and
his function consists mostly of standing there sucking oxygen and holding an unlit cigar while gately breaks down the hall  gately
rather likes ken erdedy  who came into the house about a month ago from some cushy belmont rehab  erdedy s an upscale guy 
what gately s mother would have called a yuppie  an account executive at viney and veals advertising downtown his intake form
said  and though he s about gately s age he s so softly good looking in that soft mannequinish way harvard and tufts schoolboys
have  and looks so smooth and groomed all the time even in jeans and a plain cotton sweater  that gately thinks of him as much
younger  totally ungrizzled  and refers to him mentally as  kid   erdedy s in the house mainly for  marijuana addiction   which
gately has a hard time identifying with anybody getting in enough trouble with weed to leave his job and condo to bunk in a room
full of tattooed guys who smoke in their sleep  and to work like pumping gas  erdedy just started his nine month humility job at
the merit station down by north harvard st  in allston  for    minimum wage hours a week  or to have his leg be joggling like
that all the time from tensions of withdrawal  from fucking grass  but it s not gately s place to say what s bad enough to make
somebody come in and what isn t  not for anybody else but himself  and the shapely but big time troubled new girl kate gompert
  who mostly just stays in her bed in the new women s   woman room when she isn t at meetings  and is on a suicidality

 contract with pat  and isn t getting the usual pressure to get a humility job  and gets to get some sort of scrip meds out of the meds
locker every morning   kate gompert s counselor danielle s  reported at the last staff meeting that kate had finally opened up
and told her she d mostly come in for weed  too  and not the lightweight prescription tranqs she d listed on her intake form  gately
used to treat weed like tobacco  he wasn t like some other narcotics addicts who smoked weed when they couldn t get anything
else  he always smoked weed and could always get something else and simply smoked weed while he did whatever else he could
get  gately doesn t miss weed much  the shocker type aa miracle is he doesn t much miss the demerol  either  today 
a hard november wind is spattering goopy sleet against the broad windows all around the hall  the provident nursing home
cafeteria is lit by a checkerboard array of oversized institutional bulbs overhead  a few of which are always low and give off
fluttery strobes  the fluttering bulbs are why pat montesian and all the other photic seizure prone area aas never go to white
flag  opting for the freeway group over in brookline or the candyass lake street meeting up in west newton on sunday nights 
which pat m  bizarrely drives all the way up from her home down on the south shore in milton to get to  to hear people talk about
their analysts and saabs  there is no way to account for people s taste in aa  the white flag hall is so brightly lit up all gately
can see out any of the windows is a kind of shiny drooling black against everybody s pale reflection 
miracle s one of the boston aa terms erdedy and the brand new and very shaky veiled girl resident standing over him
complain they find hard to stomach  as in  we re all miracles here  and  don t leave five minutes before the miracle happens 
and  to stay sober for    hours is a miracle  
except the brand new girl  either joelle v  or joelle d   who said she d hit the occasional meeting in the past before her
bottom and had been roundly repelled  and is still pretty much cynical and repelled  she said on the way down to provident under
gately s direct new resident supervision  says she finds even the word miracle preferable to the constant aa talk about  the grace
of god   which reminds her of wherever she grew up  where she s indicated places of worship were often aluminum trailers or
fiberboard shacks and church goers played with copperheads in the services to honor something about serpents and tongues 
gately s also observed how erdedy s also got that tufts harvard way of speaking without seeming to move his lower jaw 
 it s as if it s its own country or something   erdedy complains  legs crossed in maybe a bit of a faggy schoolboy way  looking
around at the raffle break  sitting in gately s generous shadow   the first time i ever talked  over at the st  e s meeting on
wednesday  somebody comes up after the lord s prayer and says  good to hear you  i could really i d  with that bottom you were
sharing about  the isolating  the can t and can t  it s the greenest i ve felt in months  hearing you   and then gives me this raffle
ticket with his phone number that i didn t ask for and says i m right where i m supposed to be  which i have to say i found a bit
patronizing  
the best noise gately produces is his laugh  which booms and reassures  and a certain haunted hardness goes out of his face
when he laughs  like most huge men  gately has kind of a high hoarse speaking voice  his larynx sounds compressed   i still hate
that right where you re supposed to be thing   he says  laughing  he likes that erdedy  sitting  looks right up at him and cocks his
head slightly to let gately know he s got his full attention  gately doesn t know that this is a requisite for a white collar job where
you have to show you re attending fully to clients who are paying major sums and get to expect an overt display of full attention 
gately is still not yet a good judge of anything about upscale people except where they tend to hide their valuables 
boston aa  with its emphasis on the group  is intensely social  the raffle break goes on and on  an intoxicated street guy
with a venulated nose and missing incisors and electrician s tape wrapped around his shoes is trying to sing  volare  up at the
empty podium microphone  he is gently  cheerfully induced offstage by a crocodile with a sandwich and an arm around the
shoulders  there s a certain pathos to the crocodile s kindness  his clean flannel arm around the weatherstained shoulders  which
pathos gately feels and likes being able to feel it  while he says  but at least the  good to hear you  i quit minding  it s just what
they say when somebody s got done speaking  they can t say like  good job  or  you spoke well   cause it can t be anybody s
place here to judge if anybody else did good or bad or whatnot  you know what i m saying  tiny  there  
tiny ewell  in a blue suit and laser chronometer and tiny shoes whose shine you could read by  is sharing a dirty aluminum
ashtray with nell gunther  who has a glass eye which she amuses herself by usually wearing so the pupil and iris face in and the
dead white and tiny manufacturer s specifications on the back of the eye face out  both of them are pretending to study the blond
false wood of the tabletop  and ewell makes a bit of a hostile show of not looking up or responding to gately or entering into the
conversation in any way  which is his choice and on him alone  so gately lets it go  wade mcdade has a walkman going  which
is technically ok at the raffle break although it s not a real good idea  chandler foss is flossing his teeth and pretending to throw
the used floss at jennifer belbin  most of the ennet house residents are mingling satisfactorily  the couple of residents that are
black are mingling with other blacks      the diehl kid and doony glynn are amusing themselves telling homosexuality jokes to
morris hanley  who sits smoothing his hair with his fingertips  pretending to not even acknowledge  his left hand still bandaged 
alfonso parias carbo is standing with three allston group guys  smiling broadly and nodding  not understanding a word anybody
says  bruce green has gone downstairs to the men s head and amused gately by asking his permission first  gately told him to go
knock himself out  green has good big arms and no gut  even after all the substances  and gately suspects he might have played
some ball at some point  kate gompert is totally by herself at a nonsmoking table over by a window  ignoring her pale reflection
and making little cardboard tents out of her raffle tickets and moving them around  clenette henderson clutches another black girl
and laughs and says  girl   several times  emil minty is clutching his head  geoff day in his black turtleneck and blazer keeps
lurking on the fringes of various groups of people pretending he s part of the conversations  no immediate sign of burt f  smith or
charlotte treat  randy lenz  in his cognito white mustache and sideburns  is doubtless at the pay phone in the northeast corner of
the provident lobby downstairs  lenz spends nearly unacceptable amounts of time either on a phone or trying to get in position to
use a phone   cause what i like   gately says to erdedy  erdedy really is listening  even though there s a compellingly cheap young
woman in a brief white skirt and absurd black mesh stockings sitting with her legs nicely crossed   one strap low spike black
ferragamos  too   at the periphery of his vision  and the woman is with a large man  which makes her even more compelling 
and also the veiled new girl s breasts and her hips  clefs are compelling and distracting  next to him  even in a long baggy loose
blue sweater that matches the embroidered selvage around her veil    what i think i like is how  it was good to hear you  ends up 
like  saying two separate things together   gately s also saying this to joelle  who it s weird but you can tell she s looking at you 
even through the linen veil  there s maybe half a dozen or so other veiled people in the white flag hall tonight  a decent

 percentage of people in the    step union of the hideously and improbably deformed are also in    step fellowships for other
issues besides hideous deformity  most of the room s veiled aas are women  though there is this one male veiled u h i d  guy
that s an active white flagger  tommy s  or f   who years ago nodded out on a stuffed acrylic couch with a bottle of remy and a
lit tiparillo   the guy now wears u h i d  veils and a whole spectrum of silk turtlenecks and assorted hats and classy lambskin
driving gloves  gately s had the u h i d  and veil philosophy explained to him in passing a couple times but still doesn t much get
it  it seems like a gesture of shame and concealment  still  to him  the veil  pat montesian had said there s been a few other
u h i d s who d gone through ennet house prior to the year of dairy products from the american heartland  which is when new
resident gately came wobbling in  but this joelle van dyne  who gately feels he has zero handle on yet as a person or how serious
she is about putting down substances and coming in to really get straight  this joelle is the first veiled resident gately s had under
him  as a staffer  this joelle girl  that wasn t even on the two month waiting list for intake  got in overnight under some private
arrangement with somebody on the house s board of directors  upscale enfield guys into charity and directing  there d been no
intake interview with pat at the house  the girl just showed up two days ago right after supper  she d been up at brigham and
women s for five days after some sort of horrific o d  type situation said to have included both defib paddles and priests  she d
had real luggage and this like chinese portable dressing screen thing with clouds and pop eyed dragons that even folded
lengthwise took both green and parias carbo to lug upstairs  there s been no talk of a humility job for her  and pat s counseling
the girl personally  pat s got some sort of privately directed arrangement with the girl  gately s already seen enough private type
arrangements between certain staffers and residents to feel like it s maybe kind of a character defect of ennet house  a girl from
the brookline young people s group over in a cheerleader skirt and slut stockings is ignoring all the ashtrays and putting her
extra long gasper out on the bare tabletop two rows over as she laughs like a seal at something an acne d guy in a long camelhair
car coat he hasn t taken off and sockless leather dance shoes gately s never seen at a meeting before says  and he s got his hand
on hers as she grinds the gasper out  something like putting a cigarette out against the wood grain plastic tabletop  which gately
can already see the ragged black burn divot that s formed  it s something the rankness of which would never have struck him one
way or the other  before  until gately took on half the break down the hall and wipe down the tables job at ferocious francis g  s
suggestion  and now he feels sort of proprietary about the prov ident s tabletops  but it s not like he can go over and take anybody
else s inventory and tell them how to behave  he settles for imagining the girl pinwheeling through the air toward a glass wall 
 when they say it it sort of means like what you said was good for them  it helped them out somehow   he says   but plus now
also i like saying it myself because if you think about it it also means it was good to be able to hear you  to really hear   he s
trying subtly to alternate and look at erdedy and joelle both  like he s addressing them both  it s not something he s good at  his
head s too big to be subtle with   because i remember for like the first sixty days or so i couldn t hear shit  i didn t hear nothing  i d
just sit there and compare  i d go to myself  like   i never rolled a car    i never lost a wife    i never bled from the rectum   gene
would tell me to just keep coming for a while and sooner or later i d start to be able to both listen and hear  he said it s hard to
really hear  but he wouldn t say what was the difference between hearing and listening  which pissed me off  but after a while i
started to really hear  it turns out   and this is just for me  maybe   but it turned out hearing the speaker means like all of a
sudden hearing how fucking similar the way he felt and the way i felt were  out there  at the bottom  before we each came in 
instead of just sitting here resenting being here and thinking how he bled from the ass and i didn t and how that means i m not as
bad as him yet and i can still be out there  
one of the tricks to being of real service to newcomers is not to lecture or give advice but only talk about your own personal
experience and what you were told and what you found out personally  and to do it in a casual but positive and encouraging way 
plus you re supposed to try and identify with the newcomer s feelings as much as possible  ferocious francis g  says this is one of
the ways guys with just a year or two sober can be most helpful  being able to sincerely id with the newly sick and suffering 
ferocious francis told gately as they were wiping down tables that if a crocodile with decades of sober aa time can still
sincerely empathize and identify with a whacked out bug eyed disease ridden newcomer then there s something deeply fucked up
about that crocodile s recovery  the crocodiles  decades sober  live in a totally different spiritual galaxy  inside  one long timer
describes it as he has a whole new unique interior spiritual castle  now  to live in 
part of this new joelle girl s pull for ken erdedy isn t just the sexual thing of her body  which he finds made way sexier by the
way the overlarge blue coffee stained sweater tries to downplay the body thing without being so hubristic as to try to hide it  
sloppy sexiness pulls erdedy in like a well groomed moth to a lit window   but it s also the veil  wondering what horrific
contrast to the body s allure lies swollen or askew under that veil  it gives the pull a perverse sideways slant that makes it even
more distracting  and so erdedy cocks his head a little more up at gately and narrows his eyes to make his listening look terribly
intense  he doesn t know that there s an abstract distance in the look that makes it seem like he s studying a real bitch of a   iron
on the tenth rough or something  the look doesn t communicate what he thinks his audience wants it to 
the raffle break is winding down as everybody starts to want their own ashtray  two more big urns of coffee emerge from
the kitchen door over by the literature table  erdedy is probably the second biggest leg and foot joggler in present residence  after
geoffrey d  joelle v  d  now says something very strange  it s a very strange little moment  right at the end of the raffle break  and
gately later finds it impossible to describe it in his log entry for the p m  shift  it is the first time he realizes that joelle s voice  
crisp and rich and oddly empty  her accent just barely southern and with a strange and it turns out kentuckian lapse in the
pronunciation of all apicals except s   is familiar in a faraway way that both makes it familiar and yet lets gately be sure he s
never once met her before  out there  she inclines the plane of her blue bordered veil briefly toward the floor s tile  very bad tile 
scab colored  nauseous  worst thing about the big room by far   brings it back up level  unlike erdedy she s standing  and in flats is
nearly gately s height   and says that she s finding it especially hard to take when these earnest ravaged folks at the lectern say
they re  here but for the grace of god   except that s not the strange thing she says  because when gately nods hard and starts to
interject about  it was the same for    and wants to launch into a fairly standard boston aa agnostic soothing riff about the  god 
in the slogan being just shorthand for a totally subjective and up to you  higher power  and aa being merely spiritual instead of
dogmatically religious  a sort of benign anarchy of subjective spirit  joelle cuts off his interjection and says that but that her
trouble with it is that  but for the grace of god  is a subjunctive  a counterfactual  she says  and can make sense only when
introducing a conditional clause  like e g   but for the grace of god i would have died on molly notkin s bathroom floor   so that

 an indicative transposition like  i m here but for the grace of god  is  she says  literally senseless  and regardless of whether she
hears it or not it s meaningless  and that the foamy enthusiasm with which these folks can say what in fact means nothing at all
makes her want to put her head in a radarange at the thought that substances have brought her to the sort of pass where this is the
sort of language she has to have blind faith in  gately looks at a rectangular blue selvaged expanse of clean linen whose gentle
rises barely allude to any features below  he looks at her and has no idea whether she s serious or not  or whacked  or trying like
dr  geoff day to erect denial type fortifications with some kind of intellectualish showing off  and he doesn t know what to say
in reply  he has absolutely nothing in his huge square head to identify with her with or latch onto or say in encouraging reply  and
for an instant the provident cafeteria seems pin drop silent  and his own heart grips him like an infant rattling the bars of its
playpen  and he feels a greasy wave of an old and almost unfamiliar panic  and for a second it seems inevitable that at some point
in his life he s going to get high again and be back in the cage all over again  because for a second the blank white veil levelled at
him seems a screen on which might well be projected a casual and impressive black and yellow smily face  grinning  and he feels
all the muscles in his own face loosen and descend kneeward  and the moment hangs there  distended  until the white flag raffle
coordinator for november  glenn k   glides up to the podium mike in his scarlet velour caparison and makeup and candelabrum
with candles the same color as the floor tile and uses the plastic gavel to formally end the break and bring things back to whatever
passes here for order  for the raffle drawing  the watertown guy with middle level sober time who wins the big book publicly
offers it to any newcomer that wants it  and gately is pleased to see bruce green raise a big hand  and decides he ll just turn it
over and ask ferocious francis g  for feedback on subjunctives and countersexuals  and the infant leaves its playpen alone inside
him  and the rivets of the long table his seat s attached to make a brief distressed noise as he sits and settles in for the second half
of the meeting  asking silently for help to be determined to try to really hear or die trying 
nnyc s harbor s liberty island s gigantic lady has the sun for a crown and holds what looks like a huge photo album under
one iron arm  and the other arm holds aloft a product  the product is changed each   jan  by brave men with pitons and cranes 
but it s funny what they ll find funny  aas at boston meetings  listening  the next advanced basics guy summoned by their
gleamingly bald western wear chairman to speak is dreadfully  transparently unfunny  painfully new but pretending to be at ease 
to be an old hand  desperate to amuse and impress them  the guy s got the sort of professional background where he s used to
trying to impress gatherings of persons  he s dying to be liked up there  he s performing  the white flag crowd can see all this 
even the true morons among them see right through the guy  this is not a regular audience  a boston aa is very sensitive to the
presence of ego  when the new guy introduces himself and makes an ironic gesture and says   i m told i ve been given the gift of
desperation  i m looking for the exchange window   it s so clearly unspontaneous  rehearsed plus commits the subtle but cardinal
message offense of appearing to deprecate the program rather than the self that just a few polite titters resound  and people shift
in their seats with a slight but signal discomfort  the worst punishment gately s seen inflicted on a commitment speaker is when
the host crowd gets embarrassed for him  speakers who are accustomed to figuring out what an audience wants to hear and then
supplying it find out quickly that this particular audience does not want to be supplied with what someone else thinks it wants  it s
another conundrum gately finally ran out of cerebral steam on  part of finally getting comfortable in boston aa is just finally
running out of steam in terms of trying to figure stuff like this out  because it literally makes no sense  close to two hundred
people all punishing somebody by getting embarrassed for him  killing him by empathetically dying right there with him  for him 
up there at the podium  the applause when this guy s done has the relieved feel of a fist unclenching  and their cries of  keep
coming   are so sincere it s almost painful 
but then in equally paradoxical contrast have a look at the next advanced basics speaker   this tall baggy sack of a man 
also painfully new  but this poor bastard here completely and openly nerve racked  wobbling his way up to the front  his face
shiny with sweat and his talk full of blank cunctations and disassociated leaps   as the guy speaks with terrible abashed chagrin
about trying to hang on to his job out there as his a m  hangovers became more and more debilitating until he finally got so
shaky and aphasiac he just couldn t bear to even face the customers who d come knocking on his department s door   he was 
from      to   ooh   the complaint department of filene s department store  
   what i did finally  jesus i don t know where i got such a stupid idea from  i brought this hammer in from home and
brought it in and kept it right there under my desk  on the floor  and when somebody knocked at the door i d just    i d sort of dive
onto the floor and crawl under the desk and grab up the hammer  and i d start in to pounding on the leg of the desk  real hard like 
whacketa whacketa  like i was fixing something down there  and if they opened the door finally and came in anyhow or came in
to bitch about me not opening the door i d just stay out of sight under there pounding away like hell and i d yell out i was going to
be a moment  just a moment  emergency repairs  be with them momentarily  i guess you can guess how all that pounding felt  you
know  under there  what with the big head i had every morning  i d hide under there and pound and pound with the hammer till
they finally gave up and went away  i d watch from under the desk and tell when they finally went away  from i could see their
feet from under the desk  
  and about how the hiding under the desk and pounding thing worked  incredibly enough  for almost the whole last
year of his drinking  which ended around this past labor day  when one vindictive complainant finally figured out where in
filene s to go to complain about the complaint dept    the white flaggers all fell about  they were totally pleased and amused 
the crocodiles removed their cigars and roared and wheezed and stomped both feet on the floor and showed scary teeth  everyone
roaring with identification and pleasure  this even though  as the speaker s confusion at their delight openly betrays  the story
wasn t meant to be one bit funny  it was just the truth 
gately s found it s got to be the truth  is the thing  he s trying hard to really hear the speakers   he s stayed in the habit he d
developed as an ennet resident of sitting right up where he could see dentition and pores  with zero obstructions or heads between
him and the podium  so the speaker fills his whole vision  which makes it easier to really hear   trying to concentrate on
receiving the message instead of brooding on that odd old dark moment of aphasiac terror with this veiled like psuedointellectual type girl who was probably just in some sort of complex denial  or on whatever doubtlessly grim place he feels like he
knows that smooth echoless slightly southern voice from  the thing is it has to be the truth to really go over  here  it can t be a
calculated crowd pleaser  and it has to be the truth unslanted  unfortified  and maximally unironic  an ironist in a boston aa
meeting is a witch in church  irony free zone  same with sly disingenuous manipulative pseudo sincerity  sincerity with an

 ulterior motive is something these tough ravaged people know and fear  all of them trained to remember the coyly sincere  ironic 
self presenting fortifications they d had to construct in order to carry on out there  under the ceaseless neon bottle 
this doesn t mean you can t pay empty or hypocritical lip service  however  paradoxically enough  the desperate  newly
sober white flaggers are always encouraged to invoke and pay empty lip service to slogans they don t yet understand or believe
  e g   easy does it   and  turn it over   and  one day at a time   it s called take it till you make it   itself an oft invoked
slogan  everybody on a commitment who gets up publicly to speak starts out saying he s an alcoholic  says it whether he believes
he is yet or not  then everybody up there says how grateful he is to be sober today and how great it is to be active and out on a
commitment with his group  even if he s not grateful or pleased about it at all  you re encouraged to keep saying stuff like this
until you start to believe it  just like if you ask somebody with serious sober time how long you ll have to keep schlepping to all
these goddamn meetings he ll smile that infuriating smile and tell you just until you start to want to go to all these goddamn
meetings  there are some definite cultish  brainwashy elements to the aa program  the term program itself resonates darkly  for
those who fear getting brainwashed   and gately tries to be candid with his residents re this issue  but he also shrugs and tells
them that by the end of his oral narcotics and burglary careers he d sort of decided the old brain needed a good scrub and soak
anyway  he says he pretty much held his brain out and told pat montesian and gene m  to go ahead and wash away  but he tells
his residents he s thinking now that the program might be more like deprogramming than actual washing  considering the psychic
job the disease s spider has done on them all  gately s most marked progress in turning his life around in sobriety  besides the fact
that he no longer drives off into the night with other people s merchandise  is that he tries to be just about as verbally honest as
possible at almost all times  now  without too much calculation about how a listener s going to feel about what he says  this is
harder than it sounds  but so that s why on commitments  sweating at the podium as only a large man can sweat  his thing is that
he always says he s lucky to be sober today  instead of that he s grateful today  because he admits that the former is always true 
every day  even though a lot of the time he still doesn t feel grateful  more like shocked that this thing seems to work  plus a lot of
the time also ashamed and depressed about how he s spent over half his life  and scared he might be permanently brain damaged
or retarded from substances  plus also usually without any sort of clue about where he s headed in sobriety or what he s supposed
to be doing or about really anything at all except that he s not at all keen to be back out there behind any bars  again  in a hurry 
ferocious francis g  likes to punch gately s shoulder and tell him he s right where he s supposed to be 
so but also know that causal attribution  like irony  is death  speaking on commitments wise  crocodiles  temple veins will
actually stand out and pulse with irritation if you start trying to blame your disease on some cause or other  and everybody with
any kind of sober time will pale and writhe in their chair  see e g  the white flag audience s discomfort when the skinny hardfaced advanced basics girl who gets up to speak next to last posits that she was an eight bag a day dope fiend because at sixteen
she d had to become a stripper and semi whore at the infamous naked i club out on route    a number of male eyes in the
audience flash with sudden recognition  and despite all willed restraint automatically do that crawly north to south thing down her
body  and gately can see every ashtray on the table shake from the force of joelle v  s shudder   and then but that she d had to
become a stripper at sixteen because she d had to run away from her foster home in saugus ma  and that she d had to run away
from home because       here at least some of the room s discomfort is from the fact that the audience can tell the etiology is
going to get head clutchingly prolix and involved  this girl has not yet learned to keep it simple      because  well  to begin with 
she d been adopted  and the foster parents also had their own biological daughter  and the biological daughter had  from birth  been
totally paralyzed and retarded and catatonic  and the foster mother in the household was   as joelle v  put it later to gately  
crazy as a fucking mud bug  and was in total denial about her biological daughter s being a vegetable  and not only insisted on
treating the invertebrate biological daughter like a valid member of the chordate phylum but also insisted that the father and the
adopted daughter also treat it as normal and undamaged  and made the adopted daughter share a bedroom with it  bring it along to
slumber parties  the speaker uses the term it for the invertebrate sister  and also to tell the truth uses the phrase  drag it along 
rather than  bring it along   which gately wisely doesn t dwell over   and even to school with her  and softball practice  and the
hairdresser s  and campfire girls  etc   where at whatever place she d dragged it along to it would lie in a heap  drooling and
incontinent under exquisite mother bought fashions specially altered for atrophy and top shelf lancome cosmetics that looked just
lurid on it  and with only the whites of its eyes showing  with fluid dribbling from its mouth and elsewhere  and making
unspeakable gurgly noises  completely pale and moist and stagnant  and then  when the adopted daughter now speaking turned
fifteen  the rabidly catholic wacko foster mother even announced that ok now that the adopted daughter was fifteen she could go
out on dates  but only as long as it got to come along too  in other words that the only dates the fifteen year old adopted daughter
could go out on were double dates with it and whatever submammalian escort the speaker could root up for it  and how this sort of
stuff went on and on  and how the nightmarishness of its continual pale soggy ubiquitousness in her young life would alone be
more than sufficient to cause and explain the speaker s later drug addiction  she feels  but that also it so happened that the foster
family s quiet smiling patriarch  who worked      to      as a claims processor for aetna  it turned out that the cheerful smiling
foster father actually made the wacko foster mother look like a doric column of stability by comparison  because there turned out
to be things about the biological daughter s utter paralytic pliability and catatonic inability to make anything except unspeakable
gurgly noises that the smiling father found greatly to a certain very sick advantage the speaker says she has trouble openly
discussing  still  even at thirty one months sober in aa  being as yet still so retroactively wounded and hurting from it  but so in
sum that she d been ultimately forced to run away from the adoptive foster saugus home and so become a naked i stripper and so
become a raging dope fiend not  as in so many ununique cases  because she had been incestuously diddled  but because she d been
abusively forced to share a bedroom with a drooling invertebrate who by fourteen was itself getting incestuously diddled on a
nightly basis by a smiling biological claims processor of a father who   the speaker pauses to summon courage   who
apparently liked to pretend it was raquel welch  the former celluloid sex goddess of the father s glandular heyday  and he even
called it  raquel   in moments of incestuous extremity  and how  the new england summer the speaker turned fifteen and had
to start dragging it along on double dates and then having to make sure to drag it back home again by     h  so it had plenty of
time to be incestuously diddled  that summer the smiling quiet foster father even bought  had found somewhere  a cheesy rubber
raquel welch full head pull on mask  with hair  and would now nightly come in in the dark and lift its limp soft head up and
struggle and lug to get the mask on and the relevant holes aligned for air  and then would diddle his way to extremity and cry out

  raquel   and then but he would just clamber out and off and leave the dark bedroom smiling and sated and lots of times leave
the mask still on it  he d like forget  or not care  just as he seemed oblivious  but for the grace of god  in a way  to the fetally
curled skinny form of the adopted daughter lying perfectly still in the next bed  in the dark  pretending to sleep  silent  shellbreathing  with her hard skinny wounded pre addiction face turned to the wall  in the room s next bed  her bed  the one without the
collapsible crib like hospital railings along the sides        the audience is clutching its collective head  by this time only partly in
empathy  as the speaker specifies how she was de facto emotionally all but like forced to flee and strip and swan dive into the dark
spiritual anesthesia of active drug addiction in a dysfunctional attempt to psychologically deal with one particular seminally
scarring night of abject horror  the indescribable horror of the way it  the biological daughter  had looked up at her  the speaker 
one particular final time on this one particular one of the frequent occasions the speaker had to get out of bed after the father had
come and gone and tiptoe over to its bed and lean over the cold metal hospital railing and remove the rubber raquel welch mask
and replace it in a bedside drawer under some back issues of ramparts and commonweal  after carefully closing its splayed legs
and pulling down its variously stained designer nightie  all of which she made sure to do when the father didn t bother to  at night 
so that the wacko foster mother wouldn t come in in the a m  and find it in a rubber raquel welch mask with its nightie hiked up
and its legs agape and put two and two together and get all kinds of deep denial shattered about why the foster father always went
around the foster house with a silent creepy smile  and flip out and make the invertebrate catatonic s father stop diddling it  
because  the speaker figured  if the foster father had to stop diddling it it didn t exactly take sally jessy raphael m s w  to figure
out who was then probably going to get promoted to the role of raquel  over in the next bed  the silent smiling claims processor
father never once acknowledged the adopted daughter s little post incestuous tidyings up  it s the kind of sick unspoken complicity
characteristic of wildly dysfunctional families  confides the speaker  who s also proud she says to be a member of a splinter   step fellowship  an adult child type thing called wounded  hurting  inadequately nurtured but ever recovering survivors  but
so she says it was this one particular night soon after she d turned sixteen  after the father had come and gone and uncaringly just
left its mask on again  and over to its bedside the speaker had to creep in the dark  to tidy up  and but this time it turned out there
was a problem with the raquel welch mask s long auburn horsehair tresses having gotten twisted and knotted into the semi living
strands of its own elaborately overmoussed coiffure  and the adopted daughter had to activate the perimeter of lights on its bedside
table s many bulbed vanity mirror to see to try to get the raquel welch wig untangled  and when she finally got the mask off  with
the vanity mirror still blazing away  the speaker says how she was forced to gaze for the first time on its lit up paralytic postdiddle face  and how the expression thereon was most assuredly quite enough to force anybody with an operant limbic
system     to leg it right out of her dysfunctional foster family s home  nay and the whole community of saugus ma  now
homeless and scarred and forced by dark psychic forces straight to route    s infamous gauntlet of neon lit depravity and
addiction  to try and forget  rasa the tabula  wipe the memory totally out  numb it with opiates  voice trembling  she accepts the
chairperson s proffered bandanna hankie and blows her nose one nostril at a time and says she can almost see it all over again  its
expression  in the vanity s lights only its eyes  whites showed  and while its utter catatonia and paralysis prevented the contraction
of its luridly rouged face s circumoral muscles into any conventional human facial type expression  nevertheless some hideously
mobile and expressive layer in the moist regions below real people s expressive facial layer  some slow twitch layer unique to it 
had blindly contracted  somehow  to gather the blank soft cheese of its face into the sort of pinched gasping look of neurologic
concentration that marks a carnal bliss beyond smiles or sighs  its face looked post coital sort of the way you d imagine the
vacuole and optica of a protozoan looking post coital after it s shuddered and shot its mono cellular load into the cold waters of
some really old sea  its facial expression was  in a word  the speaker says  unspeakably  unforgettably ghastly and horrid and
scarring  it was also the exact same expression as the facial expression on the stone robed lady s face in this one untitled photo of
some catholic statue that hung  the photo  in the dysfunctional household s parlor right above the little teak table where the
dysfunctional foster mother kept her beads and hours and lay breviary  this photo of a statue of a woman whose stone robes were
half hiked up and wrinkled in the most godawfully sensually prurient way  the woman reclined against uncut rock  her robes hiked
and one stone foot hanging off the rock as her legs hung parted  with a grinning little totally psychotic looking cherub type angel
standing on the lady s open thighs and pointing a bare arrow at where the stone robe hid her cold tit  the woman s face upturned
and cocked and pinched into that exact same shuddering protozoan look beyond pleasure or pain  the wacko foster mom knelt
daily to that photo  in a beaded and worshipful posture  and also required daily that it be hoisted by the adopted daughter from its
never mentioned wheelchair and held under its arms and lowered so as to approximate the same knelt devotion to the photo  and
while it gurgled and its head lolled the speaker had gazed at the photo with a nameless revulsion each morning as she held its
dead slumped weight and tried to keep its chin off its chest  and now was being forced into seeing by mirror light the exact same
expression on the face of a catatonic who d just been incestuously diddled  an expression at once reverent and greedy on a face
connected by dead hair to the slack and flapping rubber visage of an old sex goddess s empty face  and to make a long story short
 the speaker says  not trying to be funny as far as the flaggers can see   the traumatically scarred adopted girl had legged it from
the bedroom and foster house into the brooding north shore teen runaway night  and had stripped and semi whored and ivinjected her way all the way to that standard two option addicted cliff edge  hoping only to forget  that s what caused it  she says 
that s what she s trying to recover from  a day at a time  and she s sure grateful to be here with her group today  sober and
courageously remembering  and newcomers should definitely keep coming     as she s telling what she sees as etiological truth 
even though the monologue seems sincere and unaffected and at least a b  on the overall aa story lucidity scale  faces in the hall
are averted and heads clutched and postures uneasily shifted in empathetic distress at the look what happened to poor me
invitation implicit in the tale  the talk s tone of self pity itself less offensive  even though plenty of these white flaggers  gately
knows  had personal childhoods that made this girl s look like a day at six flags over the poconos  than the subcurrent of
explanation  an appeal to exterior cause that can slide  in the addictive mind  so insidiously into excuse that any causal attribution
is in boston aa feared  shunned  punished by empathic distress  the why of the disease is a labrynth it is strongly suggested all
aas boycott  inhabited as the maze is by the twin minotaurs of why me  and why not   a k a  self pity and denial  two of the
smily faced sergeant at arms  more fearsome aides de camp  the boston aa  in here  that protects against a return to  out there 
is not about explaining what caused your disease  it s about a goofily simple practical recipe for how to remember you ve got the
disease day by day and how to treat the disease day by day  how to keep the seductive ghost of a bliss long absconded from

 baiting you and hooking you and pulling you back out and eating your heart raw and  if you re lucky  eliminating your map for
good  so no whys or wherefores allowed  in other words check your head at the door  though it can t be conventionally enforced 
this  boston aa s real root axiom  is almost classically authoritarian  maybe even proto fascist  some ironist who decamped back
out there and left his meager effects to be bagged and tossed by staff into the ennet house attic had  all the way back in the year

the choreography of interface had settled into the form of steeply smoking  his bare arms crossed  going up and down slowly
on the toes of his high heels  while marathe hunched slightly in his metal chair  shoulders rounded and head slightly forward in a
practiced position that allowed him almost to sleep while still attending to every detail of a conversation or wearisome
surveillance  he  marathe  had drawn his plaid blanket up to his chest  it was increasingly chilly at the altitude of the shelf  they
could feel the remains of the u s a  sonora desert s heat rising past them into the clotted spangle of stars that were above them 
the shirt marathe wore beneath his windbreaker was not of hawaiian type 
marathe remained unsure in this time of what exactly it was that hugh steeply of u s o u s  wished to learn from him  or
verify  through mar athe s betrayal  near midnight steeply had given him the datum that he  steeply  had been on the personal
marital leave over his recent divorce  and was now back in the field of duty  wearing prosthetic breasts and woman journalist
credentials  assigned to cultivate some of the entertainment s alleged filmmaker s relatives and inner circles  marathe had made
gentle fun of the inoriginality of a journalistic cover  then later less gentle fun of steeply s cover s false name  expressing humored
doubts that the meaty electrolysized face of steeply would be responsible of launching even one ship or vessel 
there d been that first brutal winter night  early in the o n a n ite temporo subsidized era  soon after the interlace
dissemination of the man who began to suspect he was made of glass  that himself emerged from the sauna and came to lyle
all sloppy blotto and depressed over the fact that even the bastards in the avant garde journals were complaining that even in his
commercially entertaining stuff incan denza s fatal achilles  heel was plot  that incandenza s efforts had no sort of engaging plot 
no movement that sucked you in and drew you along        mario and ms  joelle van dyne are probably the only people who
know that found drama       and anticonfluentialism both came out of this night with lyle 
it s not like boston aa recoils from the idea of responsibility  though  cause  no  responsibility  yes  it seems like it all
depends on which way the arrow of presumed responsibility points  the hard faced adopted stripper had presented herself as the
object of an outside cause  now the arrow comes back around as tonight s meeting s last and maybe best advanced basics
speaker  another newcomer  a round pink girl with no eyelashes at all and a  base head s ruined teeth  gets up there and speaks in
an r less south boston brogue about being pregnant at twenty and smoking eightballs of freebase cocaine like a fiend all through
her pregnancy even though she knew it was bad for the baby and wanted desperately to quit  she tells about having her water
break and contractions start late one night in her welfare hotel room when she was right in the middle of an eightball she d had to
spend the evening turning unbelievably sordid and degrading tricks to pay for  she did what she had to do to get high  she says 
even while pregnant  she says  and she says even when the pain of the contractions got to be too bad to bear she d been unable to
tear herself away from the  base pipe to go to the free clinic to deliver  and how she d sat on the floor of the welfare hotel room
and freebased her way all through labor  that new joelle girl s veil s billowing in and out with her breath  gately sees  just like it
also was during the last speaker s description of the statue s orgasm in the catatonic s dysfunctional catholic mother s devotional
photo   and how she d finally delivered of a stillborn infant right there alone on her side like a cow on the rug of her room  all the
time throughout still compulsively loading up the glass pipe and smoking  and how the infant emerged all dry and hard like a
constipated turdlet  with no protective moisture and no afterbirth material following it out  and how the emerged infant was tiny
and dry and all withered and the color of strong tea  and dead  and also had no face  had in utero developed no eyes or nostrils and
just a little lipless hyphen of a mouth  and its limbs were malformed and arachnodactylic  and there had been some sort of
translucent reptilian like webbing between its mucronate digits  the speaker s mouth is a quivering arch of woe  her baby had been
poisoned before it could grow a face or make any personal choices  it would have soon died of substance withdrawal in the free
clinic s pyrex incubator if it had emerged alive anyway  she could tell  she d been on such a bad  base binge all that pregnant year 
and but so eventually the eightball was consumed and then the screen and steel wool ball in the pipe itself smoked and the cloth
prep filter smoked to ash and then of course likely looking pieces of lint had been gleaned off the rug and also smoked  and the
girl finally passed out  still umbilically linked to the dead infant  and how when she came to again in unsparing noonlight the next
day and saw what still clung by a withered cord to her empty insides she got introduced to the real business end of the arrow of
responsibility  and as she gazed in daylight at the withered faceless stillborn baby she was so overcome with grief and selfloathing that she erected a fortification of complete and black denial  like total denial  she held and swaddled the dead thing just
as if it were alive instead of dead  and she began to carry it around with her wherever she went  just as she imagined devoted
mothers carry their babies with them everywhere they go  the faceless infant s corpse completely veiled and hidden in a little pink
blanket the addicted expectant mother d let herself buy at woolworth s at seven months  and she also kept the cord s connection intact until her end of the cord finally fell out of her and dangled  and smelled  and she carried the dead infant everywhere  even
when turning sordid tricks  because single motherhood or not she still needed to get high and still had to do what she had to do to
get high  so she carried the blanket wrapped infant in her arms as she walked the streets in her velvet fuchsia minipants and
haltertop and green spike heels  turning tricks  until there began to be strong evidence  as she circled her block   it was august
  let s just say compelling evidence that the infant in the stained cocoon of blanket in her arms was not a biologically viable
infant  and passersby on the south boston streets began to reel away white faced as the girl passed by  stretch marked and browntoothed and lashless  lashes lost in a substance accident  fire hazard and dental dysplasia go with the freebase terrain  and also
just hauntedly calm looking  oblivious to the olfactory havoc she was wreaking in the sweltering streets  and but her august s

 trick business soon fell off sharply  understandably  and eventually word that there was a serious infant and denial problem here
got around the streets  and her fellow southie  base heads and street friends came to her with not ungentle r less remonstrances
and scented hankies and gently prying hands and tried to reason her out of her denial  but she ignored them all  she guarded her
infant from all harm and kept it clutched to her   it was by now sort of stuck to her and would have been hard to separate from
her by hand anyway   and she d walk the streets shunned and trickless and broke and in early stage substance withdrawal  with
the remains of the dead infant s tummy s cord dangling out from an unclosable fold in the now ominously ballooned and crusty
woolworth s blanket  talk about denial  this girl was in some major league denial  and but finally a pale and reeling beat cop

girls struggles and dips her knees in the little curtsies of impending potty   but so now d s s  was on the case  and a platoon of
blandly efficient wellesley alum d s s  field personnel with clipboards and scary black chanel women s businesswear were now
on the prowl in the south boston streets for the addicted speaker and her late faceless infant  and but finally around this time 
during last year s awful late august heat wave  evidence that the infant had a serious bio viability problem started presenting itself
so forcefully that even the denial ridden addict in the mother could not ignore or dismiss it   evidence which the speaker s
reticence about describing  save to say that it involved an insect attraction problem  makes things all the worse for the empathetic
white flaggers  since it engages the dark imaginations all substance abusers share in surplus   and so but the mother says how
she finally broke down  emotionally and olfactorily  from the overwhelming evidence  on the cement playground outside her own
late mother s abandoned project building off the l street beach in southie  and a d s s  field team closed in for the pinch  and she
and her infant got pinched  and special d s s  spray solvents had to be sent for and utilized in order to detach the wool worth
baby blanket from her maternal bosom  and the blanket s contents were more or less reassembled and were interred in a d s s 
coffin the speaker recalls as being the size of a mary kay makeup case  and the speaker was medically informed by somebody
with a clipboard from d s s  that the infant had been involuntarily toxified to death somewhere along in its development toward
becoming a boy  and the mother  after a painful d c for the impacted placenta she d carried inside  then spent the next four
months on the locked ward of metropolitan state hospital in waltham ma  psychotic with denial deferred guilt and cocainewithdrawal and searing self hatred  and how when she finally got discharged from met state with her first s s i  mental disability
check she found she had no taste for chunks or powders  she wanted only tall smooth bottles whose labels spoke of proof  and she
drank and drank and believed in her heart she would never stop or swallow the truth  but finally she got to where she had to  she
says  swallow it  the responsible truth  how she quickly drank her way to the old two option welfare hotel window ledge and
made a blubbering o ooh  phone call  and then so here she is  apologizing for going on so long  trying to tell a truth she hopes
someday to swallow  inside  so she can just try and live  when she concludes by asking them to pray for her it almost doesn t
sound corny  gately tries not to think  here is no cause or excuse  it is simply what happened  this final speaker is truly new 
ready  all defenses have been burned away  smooth skinned and steadily pinker  at the podium  her eyes squeezed tight  she looks
like she s the one that s the infant  the host white flaggers pay this burnt public husk of a newcomer the ultimate boston aa
compliment  they have to consciously try to remember even to blink as they watch her  listening  i d ing without effort  there s no
judgment  it s clear she s been punished enough  and it was basically the same all over  after all  out there  and the fact that it
was so good to hear her  so good that even tiny ewell and kate gompert and the rest of the worst of them all sat still and listened
without blinking  looking not just at the speaker s face but into it  helps force gately to remember all over again what a tragic
adventure this is  that none of them signed up for 
they d been the odd couple of libations  the muscled fitness guru and the tall slope shouldered optician director  often down
there in the weight room til all hours  sitting on the towel dispenser  drinking  lyle with his caffeine free diet coke  incandenza
with his wild turkey  mario literally standing by in case the ice bucket ran out or himself needed moral support getting to the
urinal  mario often fell asleep as the hour got severe  drifted in and out  slept upright and leaning forward  weight borne by his
police lock and lead receptacle 
james incandenza was one of those profound personality change drinkers who seemed quiet and centered and almost
affectless when he was sober but would move way out to one side or the other of the human emotional spectrum  when drunk  and
seem to open up in a way that was almost injudicious 
sometimes  libated late at night with lyle in the newly outfitted e t a  weight room  incandenza d open up and pour his
heart s thickest chyme right out there for all to be affected and potentially scarred by  e g  one night mario  leaning way forward
into the police lock s support  drifted awake to the sound of his father saying that if he had to grade his marriage he d give it a c  
this seems injudicious in the extreme  potentially  though mario  like lyle  tends to take data pretty much as it comes 
lyle  who sometimes would start to get tipsy himself as himself s pores began to excrete the bourbon  often brought some
blake out  as in william blake  during these all night sessions  and read incandenza blake  but in the voices of various cartoon
characters  which himself eventually started regarding as deep

if it s odd that mario incandenza s first halfway coherent film cartridge   a    minute job shot three summers back in the
carefully decorated janitor closet of subdorm b with his head mount bolex h   and foot treadle   if it s odd that mario s first
finished entertainment consists of a film of a puppet show   like a kids  puppet show   then it probably seems even odder that
the film s proven to be way more popular with e t a  s adults and adolescents than it is with the woefully historically underinformed children it had first been made for  it s proved so popular that it gets shown annually now every       continental
interdependence day  on a wide beam cartridge projector and stand up screen in the e t a  dining hall  after supper  it s part of
the gala but rather ironic annual celebration of l day at an academy whose founder had married a canadian  and it usually gets

 under way about    oh   the film  and everybody gathers in the dining hall  and watches it  and by charles tavis s festive
fiat       everybody gets to two handed snack instead of squeezing tennis balls while they watch  and not only that but normal
e t a  dietary regulations are for an hour completely suspended  and mrs  clarke  the dietician out in the kitchen   a former
four star dessert chef normally relegated here to protein conveyors and ways to vary complex carbs   mrs  clarke gets to put on
her floppy white chef s hat and just go sucrotically mad  out in west house s gleaming kitchen  everybody s supposed to wear
some sort of hat   avril incan denza positively towers in the same steeple crowned witch s hat she teaches all her classes in
every        and pemulis wears the complex yachting cap and naval braid  and pale and blotchy struck a toque with a kind of
flitty aigrette  and hal a black preacher s hat with a stern round downturned brim  etc  etc          and mario  as director and
putative author of the popular film  is encouraged to say a few words  like eight 
 thanks everybody and i hope you like it   is what he said this year  with pemulis behind him making a show of putting a
maraschino on top of the small twizzle of redi whip that o  stice had sprayed on the top of mario s head mount bolex h   
which counts as a hat  when the dessert course s zenith had gotten slightly out of control near the i  day gala supper s end  these
few brief words and round of applause are mario s big public yearly moment at e t a   and he neither likes the moment nor
dislikes it   same with the untitled film itself  which really started out as just a kids  adaptation of the onantiad  a four hour
piece of tendentiously anticonfluential political parody long since dismissed as minor incandenza by his late father s archivists 
mario s piece isn t really better than his father s  it s just different  plus of course way shorter   it s pretty obvious that somebody
else in the incandenza family had at least an amanuentic hand in the screenplay  but mario did the choreography and most of the
puppet work personally   his little s shaped arms and falcate digits are perfect for the forward curve from body to snout of a
standard big headed political puppet   and it was  without question  mario s little square hush puppy on the h   s operant foottreadle  the bolex itself mounted on one of the tunnel s locked lab s husky vi tl tripods across the over lit closet  mops and dullgray janitorial buckets carefully moved out past the frame s borders on either side of the little velvet stage

gentle s second inaugural   let the call go forth  to pretty much any nation we might feel like calling  that the past has been
torched by a new and millennial generation of americans   against a full facial still photo of a truly unmistakable personage  this
is the projected face of johnny gentle  famous crooner  this is johnny gentle  ne joyner  lounge singer turned teenybopper throb
turned b movie mainstay  for two long past decades known unkindly as the  cleanest man in entertainment   the man s a worldclass retentive  the late howard hughes kind  the really severe kind  the kind with the paralyzing fear of free floating
contamination  the either wear a surgical microfiltration mask or make the people around you wear surgical caps and masksand touch doorknobs only with a boiled hankie and take fourteen showers a day only they re not exactly showers they re withthis dermalatix brand shower   sized   hypospectral   flash   booth   that   actually   like   burns   your  outermost   layer  ofskin   off   in   a   dazzling   flash   and   leaves   you   baby s  butt  new   and   sterile   once   you   wipe   off   the   coating   of
  fine   epidermal  ash with a boiled hankie kind  then in later public life a sterile toupee wearing promoter and entertainmentunion bigwig  vegas schmaltz broker and head of the infamous velvety vocalists guild  the tanned  gold chained labor union that
enforced those seven months of infamously dreadful  live silence         the total scab free solidarity and performative silence
that struck floor shows and soundstages from desert to nj coast for over half a year until equitable compensation formulae on
certain late millennial phone order retrospective tv advertised so you don t forget order before midnight tonight type
records and cds were agreed on by management  hence then johnny gentle  the man who brought ge rca to heel  and then
thus  at the millennial fulcrum of very dark u s  times  to national politics  the facial stills that mario lap dissolves between are of
johnny gentle  famous crooner  founding standard bearer of the seminal new  clean u s  party   the strange seeming but
politically prescient annular agnation of ultra right jingoist hunt deer with automatic weapons types and far left macrobiotic
save the ozone   rain forests   whales   spotted owl and high ph waterways ponytailed granola crunchers  a surreal union of
both rush l   and hillary r c  disillusioned fringes that drew mainstream media guffaws at their first convention  held in sterile
venue   the seemingly laroucheishly marginal party whose first platform s plank had been let s shoot our wastes into
space        c u s p  a kind of post perot national joke for three years  until   white gloved finger on the pulse of an
increasingly asthmatic and sunscreen slathered and pissed off american electorate   the c u s p  suddenly swept to quadrennial
victory in an angry reactionary voter spasm that made the u w s a  and larouchers and libertarians chew their hands in envy as
the dems and g o p s stood on either side watching dumbly  like doubles partners who each think the other s surely got it  the two
established mainstream parties split open along tired philosophical lines in a dark time when all landfills got full and all grapes
were raisins and sometimes in some places the falling rain clunked instead of splatted  and also  recall  a post soviet and  jihad
era when   somehow even worse   there was no real foreign menace of any real unified potency to hate and fear  and the u s 
sort of turned on itself and its own philosophical fatigue and hideous redolent wastes with a spasm of panicked rage that in
retrospect seems possible only in a time of geopolitical supremacy and consequent silence  the loss of any external menace to hate
and fear  this motionless face on the e t a  screen is johnny gentle  third party stunner  johnny gentle  the first u s  president
ever to swing his microphone around by the cord during his inauguration speech  whose new white suited office of unspecified
services  retinue required inauguration attendees to scrub and mask and then walk through chlorinated footbaths as at public
pools  johnny gentle  managing somehow to look presidential in a fukoama microfiltration mask  whose inaugural address
heralded the advent of a tighter  tidier nation  who promised to clean up government and trim fat and sweep out waste and hose
down our chemically troubled streets and to sleep darn little until he d fashioned a way to rid the american psychosphere of the
unpleasant debris of a throw away past  to restore the majestic ambers and purple fruits of a culture he now promises to rid of the

 toxic effluvia choking our highways and littering our byways and grungeing up our sunsets and cruddying those harbors in which
televised garbage barges lay stacked up at anchor  clotted and impotent amid undulating clouds of potbellied gulls and those
disgusting blue bodied flies that live on shit  first u s  president ever to say shit publicly  shuddering   rusty hulled barges
cruising up and down petroleated coastlines or laying up reeky and stacked and emitting co as they await the opening of new
landfills and toxic repositories the people demanded in every area but their own  the johnny gentle whose c u s p  had been
totally up front about seeing american renewal as an essentially aesthetic affair  the johnny gentle who promised to be the
possibly sometimes unpopular architect of a more or less spotless america that cleaned up its own side of the street  of a newera d nation that looked out for uno  of a one time world policeman that was now going to retire and have its blue uniform deepdry cleaned and placed in storage in triple thick plastic dry cleaning bags and hang up its cuffs to spend some quality domestic
time raking its lawn and cleaning behind its refrigerator and dandling its freshly bathed kids on its neatly pressed mufti pants 
knee  a gentle behind whom a diorama of the lincoln memorial s lincoln smiled down benignly  a johnny gentle who was as
of this new minute sending forth the call that  he wasn t in this for a popularity contest   popsicle stick and felt puppets in the
address s audience assuming puzzled looking expressions above their tiny green surgical masks   a president j g   f c  who said
he wasn t going to stand here and ask us to make some tough choices because he was standing here promising he was going to
make them for us  who asked us simply to sit back and enjoy the show  who handled wild applause from camouflage fatigue  and
sandal and poncho clad c u s p s with the unabashed grace of a real pro  who had black hair and silver sideburns  just like his
big headed puppet  and the dusty brick colored tan seen only among those without homes and those whose homes had a
dermalatix hypospectral personal sterilization booth  who declared that neither tax   spend nor cut   borrow comprised the
ticket into a whole new millennial era  here more puzzlement among the inaugural audience  which mario represents by having
the tiny finger puppets turn rigidly toward each other and then away and then toward   who alluded to ripe and available novel
sources of revenue just waiting out there  unexploited  not seen by his predecessors because of the trees      who foresaw
budgetary adipose trimmed with a really big knife  the johnny gentle who stressed above all   simultaneously pleaded for and
promised   an end to atomized americans  fractious blaming of one another for our terrible       internal troubles  here bobs
and smiles from both wealthily green masked puppets and homeless puppets in rags and mismatched shoes and with used surgical
masks  all made by e t a  s fourth  and fifth grade crafts class  under the supervision of ms  heath  of match sticks and popsiclestick shards and pool table felt with sequins for eyes and painted fingernail parings for smiles frowns  under their masks 
the johnny gentle  chief executive who pounds a rubber gloved fist on the podium so hard it knocks the seal askew and
declares that dammit there just must be some people besides each other of us to blame  to unite in opposition to  and he
promises to eat light and sleep very little until he finds them   in the ukraine  or the teutons  or the wacko latins  or   pausing
with that one arm up and head down in the climactic vegas way   closer to right below our nose  he swears he ll find us some
cohesion renewing other  and then make some tough choices  alludes to a whole new north america for a crazy post millennial
world  first u s  president ever to use boss as an adjective  his throwing his surgical gloves into the miniature inaugural crowd as
souvenirs is mario s own touch 
and mario incandenza s idea of representing president gentle s cabinet as made up mostly of tall coiffured black girl puppets
in shiny imbricate sequin dresses is also of course historically inaccurate  though the honorary inclusion  in that cabinet s second
year  of the presidente of mexico and the p m  of canada is both factual and of course seminal 
pres  mex  and p m  can   in unison and green mask muffled   it is tremendously flattering to be invited to sit on the cabinet
of the leadership of our beloved neighbor to the  choose one  
gentle  thanks  boys  you have gorgeous souls 
it s not the cartridge s strongest scene  heavy on stock phrases and two handed handshakes  but the historical fact that the
presidente of mexico and p m  of canada are honorarily appointed by president gentle to be  secretaries  of mexico and canada
 respectively    as if the neighbors had already become sort of post millennial american protectorates   is foreshadowed as
ominous by a wavered d minor on the soundtrack s organ   mrs  clarke s wurlitzer  at home   but the two leaders  respectively
dusky and gallic expressions seem unperturbed  under their green masks  as more stock phrases are invoked 
because budget and broom closet constraints make artful transitions between scenes impractical  mario has opted for the
inter scenic  entr acte  device of having johnny gentle  famous crooner doing some of his repertoire s bouncier numbers  with the
cabinet members undulating and harmonizing motownishly behind him  and other puppets bouncing in tempo on  and offstage as
the script requires  audience wise  most of the e t a s under twelve  cortexes spangling with once a year sweets  have by now
emigrated hyperactively under the long tables  tablecloths and met up on the dining hall floor below and begun navigating on
hands and knees the special children s second world of shins and chairlegs and tile that exists under long tablecloths  making
various sorts of puerile trouble   investigations from last year s i  day are still in progress w r t which kid or kids tied aubrey
delint s shoelaces together and krazy glued mary esther thode s left buttock to the seat of her chair   but everyone
glycemically mature enough to sit still and watch the cartridge is having a rousing good time  eating chocolate cannolis and
twenty six layer baklava and redi whip by itself if they want and homemade raisinettes and little cream filled caramel things
and occasionally heckling or cheering ironically  every so often throwing sweets that stick to the screen  giving the smooth sterile
gentle a sort of carbuncu lar look that everyone approves  there is much cracking wise and baritone mimicry of a president
roundly disliked for over two terms now  only john wayne and a handful of other canadian students sit unhatted  chewing
stolidly  faces blurred and distant  this american penchant for absolution via irony is foreign to them  the canadian boys
remember only hard facts  and the glass walled great convexity whose southern array of athscme effectuators blow the tidy
u s  s northern oxides north  toward home  and they feel with special poignancy on      the implications of their being down
here  south of the border  training  in the land of their enemy ally  and the less gifted among them wonder whether they ll ever get
to go home again after graduation if a pro career or scholarship doesn t pan out  wayne has a cloth hankie and keeps wiping his
nose 
mario s openly jejune version of his late father s take on the rise of o n a n  and u s  experialism unfolds in little diffracted

this segues into an entr acte  with continent squeezed in for world in  it s a small world after all   which enjambment doesn t
do the rhythm section of doo wopping cabinet girls a bit of good  but does usher in the start of a whole new era

lyle  down in the dark interdependence day weight room  sometimes recalls an e t a  player from several years back whose
first name was marlon and whose last name lyle never to his knowledge learned       
the thing about this marlon was that he was always wet  arms purling  t shirt darkly v d  face and forehead ever gleaming 
orin s academy doubles partner  it had had a lemony  low cal taste  the boy s omniwetness  it wasn t exactly sweat  because you
could lick off the forehead and more beads instantly replaced what you d taken  none of real sweat s frus tratingly gradual
accretion  the kid was always in the shower  always doing his best to stay clean  there were powders and pills and electrical
appliques  and still this marlon dripped and shone  the kid wrote accomplished juvenile verses about the dry clean boy inside 
struggling to break the soggy surface  he shared extensively with lyle  he confessed to lyle one night in the quiet weight room
that he d gone in for high level athletics mostly to have an excuse of some sort for being as wet as he was  it always looked like
marlon had been rained on  but it wasn t rain  it s like marlon hadn t been dry since the womb  it s like he leaked  it had been a
tormenting but also in certain ways halcyon few years  in the past  a tormentingly unspecific hope in the air  lyle had told this
boy everything he had to tell 
it s raining tonight  though  as so often happens in autumn below the great concavity  p m  snow has given way to rain 
outside the weight room s high windows a mean wind sweeps curtains of rain this way and that  and the windows shudder and
drool  the sky is a mess  thunder and lightning happen at the same time  the copper beech outside creaks and groans  lightning
claws the sky  briefly illuminating lyle  seated lotus in spandex on the towel dispenser  leaning forward to accept what is offered
in the dark weight room  the idle resistance machines look insectile in the lightning s brief light  the answer to some of the newer
kids  complaints about what on earth lyle can be doing down there at night in a locked empty weight room is that the nighttime
weight room is rarely empty  the p m  custodians kenkle and brandt do lock it up  but the door can be dickied by even the
clumsiest insertion of an e t a  meal card between latch and jamb  the kitchen crew always wonders why so many meal cards 
edges always look ravaged  though the idle machines are scary and the room smells somehow worse in the dark  they come most
at night  the e t a s who are on to lyle  they hit the saunas out by the cement stairs until they ve got enough incentive on their
skin  then they lurk  purled and shiny  in towels  by the weight room door  waiting to enter one by one  sometimes several e t a s 
dripping in towels  not speaking  some pretending to have other business down there  lurking in the eye averted attitudes of like
patients in the waiting room of an impotence clinic or shrink  they have to be real quiet and the lights stay off  it s like the
administration ll turn a blind eye as long as you make it plausible to do so  from the dining hall  whose east wall of windows faces
comm  ad   you can hear very muffled laughter and kibitzing and the occasional scream from mario s interdependent puppet
thing  a quiet slow small stream of yellow slickered wet shoed migrations back and forth between west house and the weight
room   people know the slow parts  the times to duck out and go very briefly down to lyle  to confer  they dicky the lock and
go in one by one  in towels  proffer beaded flesh  confront the sorts of issues reserved for nighttime s gurutical tete a tete 
whispers made echoless by rubberized floors and much damp laundry 
sometimes lyle will listen and shrug and smile and say  the world is very old  or some such general remark and decline to
say much else  but it s the way he listens  somehow  that keeps the saunas full 
lightning claws the eastern sky  and it s neat in the weight room s dark because lyle is in a slightly different position and
forward angle each time he s illuminated through the window up over the grip wrist forearm machines to his left  so it looks like
there are different lyles at different ful gurant moments 
lamont chu  glabrous and high gloss in a white towel and wristwatch  haltingly confesses to an increasingly crippling
obsession with tennis fame  he wants to get to the show so bad it feels like it s eating him alive  to have his picture in shiny
magazines  to be a wunderkind  to have guys in blue i spn blazers describe his every on court move and mood in hushed broadcast cliches  to have little patches with products  names sewn onto his clothes  to be soft profiled  to get compared to m  chang 
lately expired  to get called the next great yellow u s  hope  let s not even talk about video magazines or the grid  he confesses
it to lyle  he wants the hype  he wants it  sometimes he ll pretend a glowing up at net action shot he s clipping out of a shiny

 magazine is of him  lamont chu  but then he finds he can t eat or sleep or sometimes even pee  so horribly does he envy the
adults in the show who get to have up at net action shots of themselves in magazines  sometimes  he says  lately  he won t take
risks in tournament matches even when risks are ok or even called for  because he finds he s too scared of losing and hurting his
chances for the show and hype and fame  down the road  a couple times this year the cold clenched fear of losing has itself made
him lose  he believes  he s starting to fear that rabid ambition has more than one blade  maybe  he s ashamed of his secret hunger
for hype in an academy that regards hype and the seduction of hype as the great meph istophelan pitfall and hazard of talent  a lot
of these are his own terms  he feels himself in a dark world  inside  ashamed  lost  locked in  lamont chu is eleven and hits with
two hands off both sides  he doesn t mention the eschaton or having been punched in the stomach  the obsession with futuretense fame makes all else pale  his wrists are so thin he wears his watch halfway up his forearm  which looks sort of gladiatorial 
lyle has a way of sucking on the insides of his cheeks as he listens  plates of old ridged muscle emerge and subside as he
shifts his weight slightly on the raised towel dispenser  the dispenser s at about shoulder height for someone like chu  like all
good listeners  he has a way of attending that is at once intense and assuasive  the supplicant feels both nakedly revealed and sheltered  somehow  from all possible judgment  it s like he s working as hard as you  you both of you  briefly  feel unalone  lyle will
suck in first one side s cheek and then the other   you burn to have your photograph in a magazine    i m afraid so    why again
exactly  now    i guess to be felt about as i feel about those players with their pictures in magazines    why    why  i guess to give
my life some sort of kind of meaning  lyle    and how would this do this again    lyle  i don t know  i do not know  it just does 
would  why else would i burn like this  clip secret pictures  not take risks  not sleep or pee    you feel these men with their
photographs in magazines care deeply about having their photographs in magazines  derive immense meaning    i do  they must  i
would  else why would i burn like this to feel as they feel    the meaning they feel  you mean  from the fame    lyle  don t they   
lyle sucks his cheeks  it s not like he s condescending or stringing you along  he s thinking as hard as you  it s like he s you in the
top of a clean pond  it s part of the attention  one side of his cheeks almost caves in  thinking   lamont  perhaps they did at first 
the first photograph  the first magazine  the gratified surge  the seeing themselves as others see them  the hagiography of image 
perhaps  perhaps the first time  enjoyment  after that  do you trust me  trust me  they do not feel what you burn for  after the first
surge  they care only that their photographs seem awkward or unflattering  or untrue  or that their privacy  this thing you burn to
escape  what they call their privacy is being violated  something changes  after the first photograph has been in a magazine  the
famous men do not enjoy their photographs in magazines so much as they fear that their photographs will cease to appear in
magazines  they are trapped  just as you are    is this supposed to be good news  this is awful news    lamont  are you willing to
listen to a remark about what is true    okey dokey    the truth will set you free  but not until it is finished with you    maybe i
ought to be getting back    lamont  the world is very old  you have been snared by something untrue  you are deluded  but this is
good news  you have been snared by the delusion that envy has a reciprocal  you assume that there is a flip side to your painful
envy of michael chang  namely michael chang s enjoyable feeling of being envied by lamont chu  no such animal    animal  
 you burn with hunger for food that does not exist    this is good news    it is the truth  to be envied  admired  is not a feeling  nor
is fame a feeling  there are feelings associated with fame  but few of them are any more enjoyable than the feelings associated
with envy of fame    the burning doesn t go away    what fire dies when you feed it  it is not fame itself they wish to deny you
here  trust them  there is much fear in fame  terrible and heavy fear to be pulled and held  carried  perhaps they want only to

moonlight off the idle weights  metal  is being driven right to the edge by the fact that he goes to sleep with his bed against one
wall and then but wakes up with his bed against a whole nother wall  stice d already had a whole series of beefs with roommate
kyle d  coyle because he d figured clearly coyle was moving stice s bed around in stice s sleep  but then coyle got put in the
infirmary with a suspicious discharge  and he s been out of the room for the last two nights  coyle  and here stice is still waking
up with his bed against a different wall  so then he thought like axford or struck was dickying his door with a meal card and
sneaking in really late and messing with stice s bed out of obscure motives  so but last night stice jammed a chair up against his
door and piled empty tennis ball cans on the chair to make a racket if there was any dickying  and lined up still more cans on the
sills of all three windows  just to cover all bases  and but so the reason he s here is this a m  he wakes up with his bed moved over
against the chair by the door at an angle he didn t care for one bit and with all the ball cans arranged in a neat pyramid in the dusty
rectangle where his bed was supposed to normally be  ortho stice can think of only three possible explanations for what s going
on  and he presents them to an attentive cheek sucking lyle in ascending order of grimness  one is that stice is telekinetic  but
only in his sleep  two is that somebody else at e t a  is telekinetic and has it in for stice and wants to drive him batsoid for some
reason  three is that stice is like getting up in his sleep and rearranging the room without knowing it or remembering it  which
means he s a severe fucking somnambulist  which means lord only knows what all else he could get up and wander around and do
in his sleep  he s got promise  the staff say  he s got a quite legit shot at the show when he graduates  which he does not want to
mess up with any sort of telekinetic or somnambulistical shenanigans  stice offers up the planes of his torso and forehead  he
wears one of his own personal towels  a black one  he is slim but wiry and beautifully muscled  and sweats freely and well  he

lyle waves bygones away like a gnat you barely look at  he is completely engaged  the lightning now far off out over the
atlantic treats him like a weak strobe  do not underestimate objects  he advises stice  do not leave objects out of account  the
world  after all  which is radically old  is made up mostly of objects  lyle leans in  waves stice up even closer  and consents to tell
stice the story of this one man he once knew of  this man earned his living by going to various public sites where people
congregated and were bored and impatient and cynical  he d go in and bet people that he could stand on any chair in the place and
then lift that chair up off the ground while standing on it  a bootstrap type scenario  his m o  is he climbs up on a chair and
stands there and says publicly hey  i can lift this chair i stand on  a bystander holds the bets  the idle bus depot or dmv waitingarea or hospital lobby crowd is dumbstruck  they gaze up at a man who is standing      on top of a chair he has grabbed the
back of and raised several m  off the ground  there is vigorous speculation about how the trick s done  which gives rise to side bet
action  a devoutly religious experimental oncologist dying of his own inoperable colorectal neoplastis moans why oh why lord
do you give this man this idiotic picayune power and i no power over my own ravening colorectal cells  there are numerous
silent variations on this sort of meditation in the crowd  the bet won  the   finally forked over and handed up to him  the man lyle

above the level of a    gram aminopal high energy bar now induces odd and unpleasant emotional states that don t do him one
bit of good on court 
sitting here preacher hatted  with a mouth full of multilayered baklava  hal knows perfectly well that mario gets his fetish for
cartridges about puppets and entr actes and audiences from their late father  himself  during his anticonfluential middle period 
went through this subphase of being obsessed with the idea of audiences  relationships with various sorts of shows  hal doesn t
even want to think about the grim one about the carnival of eyeballs        but this one other short high tech one was called  the
medusa v  the odalisque  and was a film of a fake stage production at ford s theater in the nation s capital of wash  dc that  like
all his audience obsessed pieces  had cost incandenza a real bundle in terms of human extras  the extras in this one are a welldressed audience of guys in muttonchops and ladies with paper fans who fill the place from first row to the rear of the balcony s

 boxes  and they re watching an incredibly violent little involuted playlet called  the medusa v  the odalisque   the relatively
plotless plot of which is just that the mythic medusa  snake haired and armed with a sword and well polished shield  is fighting to
the death or petrification against l odalisque de ste  therese  a character out of old quebecois mythology who was supposedly so
inhumanly gorgeous that anyone who looked at her turned instantly into a human sized precious gem  from admiration  a pretty
natural foil for the medusa  obviously  the odalisque has only a nail file instead of a sword  but also has a well wielded hand held
makeup mirror  and she and the medusa are basically rumbling for like twenty minutes  leaping around the ornate stage trying to
de map each other with blades and or de animate each other with their respective reflectors  which each leaps around trying to
position just right so that the other gets a glimpse of its own full frontal reflection and gets instantly petrified or gemified or
whatever  in the cartridge it s pretty clear from their milky pixeled translu cence and insubstantiality that they re holograms  but
it s not clear what they re supposed to be on the level of the playlet  whether the audience is supposed to see  not see them as
ghosts or wraiths or  real  mythic entities or what  but it s a ballsy fight scene up there on the stage   having been intricately
choreographed by an oriental guy himself rented from some commercial studio and put up in the hmh  who ate like a bird and
smiled very politely all the time and didn t have even a word to say to anybody  it seemed  except avril  to whom the oriental
choreographer had cottoned right off   balletic and full of compelling little cornerings and near misses and reversals  and the
theater s audience is rapt and clearly entertained to the gills  because they keep spontaneously applauding  as much maybe for the
film s play s choreography as anything else   which would make it more like spontaneously meta applauding  hal supposes  
because the whole fight scene has to be ingeniously choreographed so that both combatants have their respectively scaly and
cream complected backs       to the audience  for obvious reasons     except as the shield and little mirror get whipped martially
around and brandished at various strategic angles  certain members of the playlet s well dressed audience eventually start catching
disastrous glimpses of the combatants  fatal full frontal reflections  and instantly get transformed into like ruby statues in their
front row seats  or get petrified and fall like embolized bats from the balcony s boxes  etc  the cartridge goes on like this until
there s nobody left in the ford s theater seats animate enough to applaud the nested narrative of the fight scene play  and it ends
with the two aesthetic foils still rumbling like mad before an audience of varicolored stone   the medusa v  the odalisque   s own
audiences didn t think too much of the thing  because the film audience never does get much of a decent full frontal look at what it
is about the combatants that supposedly has such a melodramatic effect on the rumble s live audience  and so the film s audience
ends up feeling teased and vaguely cheated  and the thing had only a regional release  and the cartridge rented like yesterday s
newspapers  and it s now next to impossible to find  but that wasn t by any stretch of the imagination the james o  incandenza
film that audiences hated the most  the most hated incandenza film  a variable length one called the joke  had only a very brief
theatrical release  and then only at the widely scattered last remains of the pre interlace public art film theaters in arty places like
cambridge ma and berkeley ca  and interlace never considered it for pulse order rerelease  for obvious reasons  the art film
theaters  marquees and posters and ads for the thing were all required to say something like  the joke   you are strongly
advised not to shell out money to see this film  which art film habitues of course thought was a cleverly ironic anti ad joke 
and so they d shell out for little paper theater tickets and file in in their sweater vests and tweeds and dirndls and tank up on
espresso at the concession stand and find seats and sit down and make those little pre movie leg and posture adjustments  and look
around with that sort of vacant intensity  and they d figure the tri lensed bolex h   cameras   one held by a tall stooped old guy
and one complexly mounted on the huge head of the oddly forward listing boy with what looked like a steel spike coming out of
his thorax   the big cameras down by the red lit exits on either side of the screen  the patrons figured  were there for like an ad
or an anti ad or a behind the scenes metafilmic documentary or something  that is  until the lights went down and the film started
up and what was on the wide public screen was just a wide angled binoculated shot of this very art film theater s audience filing in
with espressos and finding seats and sitting down and looking around and getting adjusted and saying knowledgeable little premovie things to their thick lensed dates about what the don t pay to see this ad and bolex cameras probably signified  artistically  and settling in as the lights dimmed and facing the screen  i e  now themselves  it turns out  with the coolly excited smiles
of highbrow entertainment expectation  smiles which the cameras and screen s projection now revealed as just starting to drop
from the faces of the audience as the audience saw row after row of itself staring back at it with less and less expectant and more
and more blank and then puzzled and then eventually pissed off facial expressions  the joke s total running time was just exactly
as long as there was even one cross legged patron left in the theater to watch his own huge projected image gazing back down at
him with the special distaste of a disgusted and ripped off feeling art film patron  which ended up being more than maybe twenty
minutes only when there were critics or film academics in the seats  who studied themselves studying themselves taking notes
with endless fascination and finally left only when the espresso finally impelled them to the loo  at which point himself and mario
would have to frantically pack up cameras and lens cases and coaxials and run and totter like hell to catch the next cross country
flight from cambridge to berkeley or berkeley to cambridge  since they obviously had to be there all set up and bolex d for each
showing at each venue  mario said lyle had said incandenza had confessed that he d loved the fact that the joke was so publicly
static and simple minded and dumb  and that those rare critics who defended the film by arguing at convolved length that the
simple minded stasis was precisely the film s aesthetic thesis were dead wrong  as usual  it s still unclear whether it was the
eyeball and sideshow thing or  the medusa v      or the joke that had metamorphosized into their late father s later involvement
with the hostilely anti real genre of  found drama   which was probably the historical zenith of self consciously dumb stasis  but
which audiences never actually even got to hate  for a priori reasons

this catastatic feature of the puppet film s plot   that johnny gentle  famous crooner threatens to bomb his own nation and
toxify neighbors in an insane pout over canada s reluctance to take redemised title over o n a n  s very own vast dump  
resonates powerfully with those members of the movie s e t a  audience who know that this whole parodic pseudo onantiad
scenario is actually a puppet a clef type allusion to the dark legend of one eric clipperton and the clipperton brigade  in the very
last couple years of solar  unsubsidized time  this kid eric clipperton appeared for the first time as an unseeded sixteen year old
in east coast regional tournament play  the little town or academy hailed from slot after clipperton s name on tournament
draw sheets just said  ind    presumably for  independent   nobody d heard of him before or knew where he came from  he d just
sort of seepily risen  some sort of human radon  from someplace low and unknown  whence he lent the cliche  win or die in the
attempt  grotesquely literal new levels of sense 
for the clipperton legend derived from the fact that this clipperton kid owned a hideous and immaculately maintained clock
   semiautomatic sidearm that came in a classy little leather handled blond wood case with german high gothic script on it and
a velvet gun shaped concavity inside where the clock    lay nestled in plush velvet  gleaming  with another little rectangular
divot for the    shot clip  and that he brought the gun case and clock    out on the court with him along with his towels and
water jug and sticks and gear bag  and from his very first appearance on the east coast jr  tour made clear his intention to blow his
own brains out publicly  right there on court  if he should lose  ever  even once 
thus there came to be  in most every tournament with an initial draw of     a group of three boys  then four  and by the
semifinals five  then finally six boys who for that tournament formed the clipperton brigade  players who d had the misfortune to
draw and meet eric clipperton and clipper ton s well oiled clock     and who understandably declined to be the player to cause
clipperton to eliminate his own map for keeps in public for something as comparatively cheesy as a tournament win over
clipperton  a win over clipperton had no meaning because a loss to clipperton had no meaning and didn t hurt anybody s
regional and u s t a  ranking  not once the guys in the u s t a  computer center caught on to the clipperton strategic m o  thus
an early exit from a tournament because of a loss to clipperton came to be regarded as sort of like a walk in baseball  stats wise 
and a boy who found himself in the clipperton brigade and defaulted his round tended to view that tournament as a kind of
unexpected vacation  a chance to rest and heal  to finally get some sun on the chest and ankles  to work on chinks in his game s
armor  to reflect a little on what it all might mean 
clipperton s first meaningless victory ever came at sixteen  unseeded  at the hartford jr  open  first round  against one ross
reat  of maddox oh and the just opened enfield tennis academy  for some reason it s struck who sort of specializes in this
story and never misses a chance to tell new e t a s the tale of clipperton v  reat  clipperton s an ok player  nothing spectacular
but also not like absurdly out of place at a regional grade tourney  but reat is at fifteen seasoned and high ranked  and the third
seed at hartford  and reat is  for a while   as would be s o p  for a high seed in the first round   basically cleaning under his
nails with this unseeded unknown eric clipperton  at     in the second set  clipperton sits down at the side change and  instead
of toweling off  reaches into his gear bag and extracts his classy little blond wood case and gets out the clock     fondles it 
takes out the clip and hefts it and rams it home in its slot at the base of the grip with a chillingly solid sounding click  caresses
his left temple with the thing s blunt shiny barrel  everybody watching the match agrees it is one ugly and all business looking
piece of personal defense hardware  clipper ton climbs up the rungs of the lifeguardish chair the umpire in his blue blazer      
sits in and uses the umpire s mike to make public his intention of blowing his personal brains out all over the court with the
hideous clock  should he lose  the small first round gallery stiffens and inhales and doesn t exhale for a long time  reat audibly
gulps  reat is tall  densely freckled  a good kid  one of incandenza s fair haired boys  not too bright  with the satellite tour so
clearly in his future that at only fifteen he s already starting cholera shots and mastering third world exchange rates  and but for
the remainder of the match  which lasts exactly eleven more games  clipperton plays tennis with the clock    held steadily to his
left temple  the gun makes tossing kind of a hassle  on clipperton s serve  but reat is letting the serves go by untouched anyway 
none of the e t a  staff has bothered to show up and coach reat through what was supposed to be a standard first round
fingernail cleaning  and so reat is strategically and emotionally all alone out there  and he s opted for not even pretending to make
an effort  given what the unseeded clipperton seems willing to sacrifice for a win  ross reat was the first and last junior player

 ever to shake clipperton s free hand at the end of a match  and the moment s captured in a hartford cou rant staff photo that some
e t a  wiseacre d later glued to the door of struck s room with so much elmer s all over the back that taking it off would gut the
varnish  so the thing stays up for all in the hall to see  reat here up at net on one knee  one arm over his eyes  the other hand
extended upward to a clipperton who d simply obliterated him psychologically  and ross reat was never quite exactly the same
ever again after that  both schtitt and de lint have assured all future potentially mercy minded e t a  males 
and  the legend s story goes  eric clipperton never henceforth loses  no one is willing to beat him and risk going through life
with the sight of the clock going off on his conscience  nobody ever knows where clipperton comes from  to play  never seen at
airports or interstate exit ramps or ever even spotted carb loading at any denny s between matches  he just starts materializing 
always alone  at increasingly high level junior tournaments  appears on draw sheets with  ind   by his name  plays competitive
tennis with a clock at his left temple        and his opponents  unwilling to sacrifice clipperton s hostage  clipperton meme  
barely even try  or else they go for impossible angles and spins  or else talk on mobile phones while they play or try to hit every
ball between their legs or behind their backs  and the matches  galleries tend to boo clipperton just as much as they dare  and
clipperton sits and hefts his    shot clip and takes the brass jacketed   mm  cartridges out sometimes and clicks a few together
ruminatively in his hand in the sideline chair at all the odd game breaks  and sometimes he tries little western gunslinger
triggerguard spins during the breaks  but when play resumes clipperton s deadly serious once more and has the clock    at his
temple  playing  and mows through the lackadaisical clipperton brigade round by round  and wins the whole tournament by what
is essentially psychic default  and then right after collecting his trophy vanishes like the ground itself inhaled him  his only even
remote friend on the jr  tour is eight year old mario incandenza  whom clipperton meets because  even though disney leith and
an early prorector named cantrell are shepherding the male tournament contingent  including a solid but sort of plateau stuck and
no longer much improving seventeen year old orin incandenza  that summer  e t a  headmaster dr  j  o  incandenza shows up
at quite a few of the events on the domestic circuit  doing under ostensible u s t a  auspices a two part documentary on jr 
competitive tennis  stress  and light  and so mario s tottering around with lens cases and tuffy tripods etc  at most of that late
summer s meaningful events  and meets clipperton  and finds clipperton intriguing and in ways he can t be very articulate about
hilarious  and is kind to him and seeks out his company  clipperton s  or at any rate at least treats clipperton like he exists 
whereas by late july everybody else s attitude toward clipperton resembled that kind of stiffly conspicuous nonrecognition that
e g  accompanies farts at formal functions  one of himself s short test cartridges   shot to check out transverse aberration at
various sun angles  the case s little adhesive sticker says   contains the only available footage of the late eric clipperton      
  from the preponderance of salt tablet dispensers and littered pledge husks and dade county ambulances it was pretty likely
shot at the hideous sunkist jr  inv  cramp fest in august in miami   just a couple overexposed meters of clipperton  head down
and hunched on a low orange bleacher  bony shouldered  in no shirt and untied nikes  his gothic scripted case in his lap  his
elbows on his knees and his hands spidered across both cheeks  staring down between his feet and trying not to smile as a
withered toddler sized and forward listing mario stands beside him  supported by his portable police lock  holding a light meter
and something else too halated to make out on the tape  open very wide for a homodontic laugh at something funny clipperton has
apparently just let slip 
hal  having smoked cannabis on four separate occasions   twice w  others   on this continental day of rest  plus still in a
kind of guiltily sickening stomach pit shock from the afternoon s eschaton debacle and his failure to intervene or even get up out
of his patio chair  hal has lost a bit of his grip and has just gotten on the outside of his fourth chocolate cannoli in half an hour 
and is feeling the icy electric keening of some sort of incipient carie in the left molar range  and also now as usual  after
swinishness with sugar  finds himself sinking  emotionally  into a kind of distracted funk  the puppet film is reminiscent enough
of the late himself that just about the only more depressing thing to pay attention to or think about would be advertising and the
repercussions of o n a n ite reconfiguration for the u s  advertising industry  mario s film executes some rather over arty flashcuts between the erections of lucite fortifications and athscme and e w d  displacement installations along the new u s 
border  on the one hand  and the shadowily implied rodney tine disastrous love interest element with the voluptuous puppet
representing the infamous and enigmatic quebecois fatale known publicly only as  luria p            on the other 
tine s puppet s tiny brown felt hand is on luria s voluptuously padded little popsicle stick knee in the famous vienna 
virginia szechuan steakhouse where  according to dark legend  subsidized time was conceived on the back of a chintzy chinesezodiac paper placemat  by r  tine  hal happens to know the fall and rise of millennial u s  advertising exceptionally well 
because one of the only two academic things he s ever written about anything even remotely filmic       was a mammoth
research paper on the tangled fates of broadcast television and the american ad industry  this was the final and grade determining
project in mr  u  ogilvie s year long intro to entertainment studies in may of y p w   and hal  a seventh grader and only up to r
in the condensed o e d   wrote about tv advertising s demise with a reverent tone that sounded like the events had taken place at
the misty remove of glaciers and guys in pelts instead of just four years prior  more or less overlapping with the waxing of the
gentle era and experialist reconfiguration mario s puppet show makes fun of 
there s no question that the network television industry   meaning  since pbs is a whole different kettle  the big three plus
the fast starting but low endurance fox   had already been in serious trouble  between the exponential proliferation of cable
channels  the rise of the total viewer control hand held remotes known historically as zappers  and vcr recording advances that
used subtle volume  and hysterical pitch sensors to edit most commercials out of any program taped  here a rather chatty
digression on legal battles between networks and vcr manufacturers over the edit function that mr  o  drew a big red yawning
skull next to  in the margin  out of impatience   the networks were having problems drawing the kind of audiences they needed to
justify the ad rates their huge overhead s slavering maw demanded  the big four s arch foe was america s     plus regional and
national cable networks  which  in the pre millennial limbaugh era of extraordinarily generous justice dept  interpretation of the
sherman statutes  had coalesced into a fractious but potent trade association under the stewardship of tci s malone  tbs s
turner  and a shadowy albertan figure who owned the view out the simulated window of various lavish homes in exoticlocales channel  the yuletide fireplace channel  cbc cable s educational programming matrix  and four of le groupe videoiron s five big canadian shop at home networks  mounting an aggressive hearts and minds campaign that derided the  passivity 
of hundreds of millions of viewers forced to choose nightly between only four statistically pussified network broadcasters  then

 extolled the  empoweringly american choice  of     plus esoteric cable options  the american council of disseminators of cable
was attacking the four right at the ideological root  the psychic matrix where viewers had been conditioned  conditioned  rather
deliciously  by the big four networks and their advertisers themselves  hal notes  to associate the freedom to choose and the
right to be entertained with all that was u s  and true 
the a c d c  campaign  brilliantly orchestrated by boston ma s viney and veals advertising  was pummelling the big four
in the fiscal thorax with its ubiquitous anti passivity slogan  don t sit still for anything less  when a wholly unintended coup de
grace to network viability was delivered in the form of an unrelated viney and veals side venture  v v  like most u s  ad
agencies  greedily buttered its bread on every conceivable side when it could  and started taking advantage of the plummeting big
four advertising rates to launch effective network ad campaigns for products and services that wouldn t previously have been
able to afford national image proliferation  for the obscure local nunhagen aspirin co  of framingham ma  viney and veals got
the enfield based national cranio facial pain foundation to sponsor a huge touring exhibition of paintings by artists with
crippling cranio facial pain about crippling cranio facial pain  the resultant network nunhagen ads were simply silent    second
shots of some of the exhibits  with nunhagen aspirin in soothing pale pastels at lower left  the paintings themselves were
excruciating  the more so because consumer hdtv had arrived  at least in the very upscale incandenza home  the ads with the
more dental pain type paintings hal doesn t even want to think back on  what with a fragment of cannoli wedged someplace
upper left he keeps looking around for schacht to ask him to have an angle mirrored look at  one he can recall was of an ordinary
middle class american guy s regular face  but with a tornado coming out of the right eyesocket and a mouth at the vortex of that
tornado  screaming  and that was a mild one        the ads cost next to nothing to produce  nunhagen aspirin sales went
nationally roofward even as ratings figures for the nunhagen ads themselves went from low to abysmal  people found the
paintings so excruciating that they were buying the product but recoiling from the ads  now you d think this wouldn t matter so
long as the product itself was selling so well  this fact that millions of national viewers were zapping or surfing to a different channel with their remotes the moment a silent painted twisted face with a hatchet in its forehead came on  but what made the
nunhagen ads sort of fatally powerful was that they also compromised the ratings figures for the ads that followed them and for
the programs that enclosed the ads  and  worse  were disastrous because they were so violently unpleasing to look at that they
awakened from their spectatorial slumbers literally millions of network devotees who d hitherto been so numbed and pacified
they usually hadn t bothered to expend the thumb muscle energy required to zap or surf away from anything on the screen 
awakened legions of these suddenly violently repelled and disturbed viewers to the power and agency their thumbs actually
afforded them 
viney and veals s next broadcast cash cow  a lurid series of spots for a national string of walk in liposuction clinics 
reinforced the voiv trend of high product sales but dreadful ad ratings  and here the big four were really put on the spot  because
  even though the critics and p t a s and eating disorder oriented distaff pacs were denouncing the lipovac spots  shots of
rippling cellulite and explicit clips of procedures that resembled crosses between hyperbolic hoover upright demonstrations and
filmed autopsies and cholesterol conscious cooking shows that involved a great deal of chicken fat drainage  and even though
audiences  flights from the lipovac spots themselves were absolutely gutting ratings for the other ads and the shows around them
  network execs  sweaty sleep infected with vivid rem visions of flaccid atrophied thumbs coming twitchily to life over remote
zap and surf controls   even though the spots were again fatally potent  the lipovac string s revenues were so obscenely
enhanced by the ads that lipovac unltd  could soon afford to pay obscene sums for    second network spots  truly obscene 
sums the besieged four now needed in the very worst way  and so the lipovac ads ran and ran  and much currency changed
hands  and overall network ratings began to slump as if punctured with something blunt  from a historical perspective it s easy to
accuse the network corporations of being greedy and short sighted w r t explicit liposuction  but hal argued  with a compassion
mr  ogilvie found surprising in a seventh grader  that it s probably hard to be restrained and far sighted when you re fighting
against a malignant invasive v v backed cable kabal for your very fiscal life  day to day 
in hindsight  though  the big four s spinal camel straw had to have been v v s trio of deep focus b w spots for a tiny
wisconsin cooperative firm that sold tongue scrapers by pre paid mail  these ads just clearly crossed some kind of
psychoaesthetic line  regardless of the fact that they single handedly created a national tongue scraper industry and put fond du
lac s nocoat inc  on the fortune            stylistically reminiscent of those murderous mouthwash  deodorant  and dandruffshampoo scenarios that had an antihero s chance encounter with a gorgeous desire object ending in repulsion and shame because
of an easily correctable hygiene deficiency  the nocoat spots  chilling emotional force could be located in the exaggerated
hideousness of the near geologic layer of gray white material coating the tongue of the otherwise handsome pedestrian who
accepts a gorgeous meter maid s coquettish invitation to have a bit of a lick of the ice cream cone she s just bought from an
avuncular sidewalk vendor  the lingering close up on an extended tongue that must be seen to be believed  coat wise  the slowmotion full frontal shot of the maid s face going slack with disgust as she recoils  the returned cone falling unfelt from her
repulsion paralyzed fingers  the nightmarish slo mo with which the mortified pedestrian reels away into street traffic with his
whole arm over his mouth  the avuncular vendor s kindly face now hateful and writhing as he hurls hygienic invectives 
these ads shook viewers to the existential core  apparently  it was partly a matter of plain old taste  ad critics argued that the
nocoat spots were equivalent to like preparation h filming a procto exam  or a depend adult undergarment camera panning for
floor puddles at a church social  but hal s paper located the level at which the big four s audiences reacted  here  as way closer to
the soul than mere tastelessness can get 
v v s nocoat campaign was a case study in the eschatology of emotional appeals  it towered  a kind of uberad  casting a
shaggy shadow back across a whole century of broadcast persuasion  it did what all ads are supposed to do  create an anxiety
relievable by purchase  it just did it way more well than wisely  given the vulnerable psyche of an increasingly hygiene conscious
u s a  in those times 
the nocoat campaign had three major consequences  the first was that horrible year hal vaguely recalls when a nation
became obsessed with the state of its tongue  when people would no sooner leave home without a tongue scraper and an
emergency backup tongue scraper than they d fail to wash and brush and spray  the year when the sink and mirror areas of public
restrooms were such grim places to be  the nocoat co op folks traded in their b gosh overalls and hand woven ponchos for

 armani and dior  then quickly disintegrated into various eight figure litigations  but by this time everybody from procter  
gamble to tom s of maine had its own brand s scraper out  some of them with baroque and potentially hazardous electronic
extras 
the second consequence was that the big four broadcast networks finally just plain fell off the shelf  fiscally speaking 
riding a crest of public disaffection not seen since the days jif commercials had strangers shoving their shiny noses in your open
jar  the malone turner and shadowy albertan led cable kabal got sponsors whose ads had been running as distant as seven or
eight spots on either side of the nocoat gaggers to jump ship to a c d c  u s  broadcast tv s true angels of death  malone and
turner then immediately parlayed this fresh injection of sponsorial capital into unrefusable bids for the rights to the n c a a 
final four  the mlb world series  wimbledon  and the pro bowlers tour  at which point the big four suffered further defections
from schick and gillette on one side and miller and bud on the other  fox filed for ch     protection monday after a c d c  s
coup announcements  and the dow turned grizzly indeed on g e   paramount  disney  etc  within days three out of the big four
networks had ceased broadcasting operations  and abc had to fall back on old  happy days  marathons of such relentless
duration that bomb threats began to be received both by the network and by poor old henry winkler  now hairless and sugaraddicted in la honda ca and seriously considering giving that lurid looking but hope provoking lipovac procedure a try       
and but the ironic third consequence was that almost all the large slick advertising agencies with substantial network billings

but these consequences  own consequence   with all the yankee ingenious irony that attends true resurrections   comes
when the now combined big four  muted and unseen  now  but with its remaining creditor proof assets now supporting only those
rapaciously clever executive minds that can survive the cuts down to a skeleton of a skeleton staff  rises from the dust heap and
has a collective last hurrah  ironically deploying v v s old pro choice anti passivity appeal to obliterate the a c d c  that had

what matter whether your  choices  are   or      or      veals s campaign argued  because here you were   assuming of
course you were even cable ready or dish equipped and able to afford monthly fees that applied no matter what you  chose  each
month   here you were  sitting here accepting only what was pumped by distant a c d c  fiat into your entertainment ken  here
you were consoling yourself about your dependence and passivity with rapid fire zapping and surfing that were starting to be
suspected to cause certain rather nasty types of epilepsy over the longish term  the cable kabal s promise of  empowerment   the
campaign argued  was still just the invitation to choose which of     visual spoon feedings you d sit there and open wide
for        and so but what if  their campaign s appeal basically ran  what if  instead of sitting still for choosing the least of

the rest  for hal  is recent history 
by the time not only second run hollywood releases but a good many first run films  plus new sitcoms and crime dramas and
near live sports  plus now also big name anchor nightly newscasts  weather  art  health  and financial analysis cartridges were
available and pulsing nicely onto cartridges everywhere  the ranks of a c d c  s own solvent program pumpers had been
winnowed back to the old movie and afternoon baseball major metro regional systems of more like the b s     s  passive
pickings were slim
now  american mass entertainment became inherently pro active  consumer driven  and because advertisements were now
out of the televisual question   any halfway sensitive power pc s cpu could edit out anything shrill or ungratifying in the postreceipt review function of an entertainment diskette   cartridge production  meaning by now both the satellitic  spontaneous
dissemination  of viewer selected menu programming and the factory recording of programming on packaged     mb diskettes

interlace that had patented the digital transmission process for moving images and held more stock than any one of the five baby
bells involved in the internet fiber optic transmission grid bought for      on the dollar from gte after sprint went belly up
trying to launch a primitively naked early mask  and tableauxless form of videophony   became almost hobbes ianly freemarket  no more network reluctance to make a program too entertaining for fear its commercials would pale in comparison  the
more pleasing a given cartridge was  the more orders there were for it from viewers  and the more orders for a given cartridge  the
more interlace kicked back to whatever production facility they d acquired it from  simple  personal pleasure and gross revenue
looked at last to lie along the same demand curve  at least as far as home entertainment went 
and as interlace s eventual outright purchase of the networks  production talent and facilities  of two major home computer

but there were   could be   no ads of any kind in the interlace pulses or rom cartridges  was the point hal s presentation
kept struggling to return to  and so then besides e g  a turner who kept litigating bitterly via shortwave radio from his equatorial
yacht  the true loser in the shift from a c d c  cable to interlace grid was an american advertising industry already reeling from
the death of broadcast s big four  no significant markets seemed in any hurry to open up and compensate for the capping of tv s
old gusher  agencies  reduced to skeletal cells of their best and most rapacious creative minds  cast wildly about for new pulses to
finger and niches to fill  billboards sprouted with near mycological fury alongside even rural two laners  no bus  train  trolley  or
hack went unfestooned with high gloss ads  commercial airliners began for a while to trail those terse translucent ad banners
usually reserved for like piper cubs over football games and july beaches  magazines  already endangered by hd video
equivalents  got so full of those infuriating little fall out ad cards that fourth class postal rates ballooned  making the e mail of
their video equivalents that much more attractive  in another vicious spiral  chicago s once vaunted sickengen  smith and
lundine went so far as to get ford to start painting little domestic product come ons on their new lines  side panels  an idea that
fizzled as u s  customers in nike t shirts and marlboro caps perversely refused to invest in  cars that sold out   in contrast to just
about the whole rest of the industry  a certain partnerless metro boston ad agency was doing so well that it was more out of ennui
and a sense of unlikely challenge that p  tom veals consented to manage pr for the fringe candidacy of a former crooner and
schmaltz mogul who went around swinging a mike and ranting about literally clean streets and creatively refocused blame and
rocketing people s waste into the forgiving chill of infinite space       
   april     may year of the depend adult undergarment
marathe did not quite sleep  they had remained on the shelf for some hours  he thought it a bit of much that steeply refused
even for a brief time to sit down upon the ground  if his persona s skirt rode up above his weapon  what was the difference  were
grotesque and humiliating undergarments also involved  marathe s wife had been in an irreversible coma for fourteen months 
marathe was able to refresh himself without quite sleeping  it was not a state of fugue or neural relaxation  but a type of detachment  he had learned this in the months after losing his legs to a u s a  train  part of marathe floated off and hovered somewhere
just above him  crossing its legs  nibbling at his consciousness as does a spectator at popcorn 
at some times on the outcropping steeply went farther than crossing his arms  almost embracing himself  chilled but
unwilling to comment on the chill  marathe noted that the gesture of self embrace appeared convincingly feminine and
unconscious  steeply s preparations for his returning field assignment had been disciplined and effective  the feature of complete
un swallowability about m  steeply as a u s a  female journalist   even a massive and unfortunate looking u s a  female
journalist   was his feet  these were broad and yellow nailed  hairy and trollesque  the ugliest feet marathe had observed
anywhere south of     n  and the ugliest supposedly female feet of his experience 
both men were strangely reluctant  somehow  to broach the subject of plans for getting down off the shelf in the utter dark 
steeply didn t even waste time wondering how marathe could have gotten up  or down  there in the first place  short of some sort
of helicopter drop  which capricious winds and the proximity of the mountainside made unlikely  the dogma around unspecified
services was that if les assassins des fauteuils rollents had one achilles  heel it was their penchant for showing off  making a
spectacle of denying any kind of physical limitation  etc  steeply had field interfaced with remy marathe once on a ricketyfeeling louisiana oil platform    plus clicks out of caillou bay  covered the whole time by armed cajun sympathizers  marathe
always disguised the boggling size of his arms under a long sleeved windbreaker  his eyelids were half closed whenever steeply
turned to look  if he  marathe  were a cat he would be purring  one hand stayed below the blanket at all times  steeply noted 
steeply himself had a small and unregistered taurus pt  taped to his shaved inner thigh  which was the main reason he was
reluctant to sit down on the outcrop ping s stone  the weapon was unsafetied 
in the faint lume  and starlight marathe found the four limbed american s high heeled feet compellingly grotesque  like
loaves of soft processed u s a  bread being slowly squeezed and mangled by the footwear s straps  the meaty compression of the
toes at the shoes  open tips  the leather faintly creaking as he bobbed up and down  hugging himself chillily in the sleeveless
summer dress  his fleshy bare arms webbed redly with mottle in the chill  one arm luridly scratched  the received wisdom among
quebecois anti o n a n  cells was that there was something latent and sadistic in the bureau des services sans specificite s
assignments of fictional personae for its field operatives   casting men as women  women as longshoremen or orthodox
rabbinicals  heterosexual men as homosexual men  caucasians as negroes or caricaturesque haitians and dominicans  healthy
males as degenerative nerve disease sufferers  healthy women operatives as hydro cephalic boys or epileptic public relations

 executives  nondeformed u s o u s  personnel made not only to pretend but sometimes to actually suffer actual deformity  all for
the realism of their field personae  steeply  silent  rose and fell absently on the toes of these feet  the feet were also visibly
unused to high u s a  women s heels  for they were mangled looking  deprived of flowing blood and abundantly blistered  and the
smallest toes  nails were blackening and preparing  marathe noted  in the future to fall off 
but marathe knew also that something within the real m  hugh steeply did need the humiliations of his absurd fieldpersonae  that the more grotesque or unconvincing he seemed likely to be as a disguised persona the more nourished and
actualized his deep parts felt in the course of preparation for the humiliating attempt to portray  he  steeply  used the mortification
he felt as a huge woman or pale negro or palsied twit of a degenerative musician as fuel for the assignments  performance  steeply
welcomed the subsumption of his dignity and self in the very role that offended his dignity of self      the psychomechanics
became too confusing for marathe  who had not the capacity for abstractions of his a f r  superiors fortier and broullime  but he
knew this was why steeply was one of services sans speci ficite s finest field operatives  once spending the better part of a year in
magenta robes  sleeping three hours nightly and allowing his large head to be shaved and teeth removed  shaking a tambourine in
airports and selling plastic flowers on median strips to infiltrate a cult fronted   amino   hydroxytetralin       import ring in the
u s a  city seattle 
steeply said  because this is the thing about the a f r  that really gives them the fantods  if you re talking about fear and what
to fear   he spoke either quietly or not  that marathe could determine  the empty expanse they both faced off the shelf sucked all
resonance  causing every sound to sound self enclosed and every utterance to seem flatly soft and somehow overintimate  almost
post coital  the sounds of things said beneath blankets  winter beating at the log walls  steeply himself appeared frightened 
perhaps  or confused  he continued   this disinterest  by you guys  it seems  in anything but the harm itself  just getting the
entertainment out there to hurt us  
the naked aggression by us  
muscles beneath the nylons of the calves bulged and receded as steeply bobbed   the boys in behavioral science say they
can t see any sort of positive political goal the a f r  even wants  anything duplessis was having your fortier work toward  
 the u s a  fantods are meaning fear  confusion  standing hair  
the f l q  and montcalmists   shit  even the most whacked out of alberta s ultra rightists   
m  duplessis had once studied beneath radical edmonton jesuits  marathe reflected 
   them we can begin to understand  as political bodies  them we can more or less get a feel for dealing with  
their aggression is clothed in agenda  the bureau of you perceives  
steeply s was a thinking face now  in apparent puzzlement  they at least have aims  real desires  
 for themselves  
steeply appeared convincingly to ruminate   it s like there s a context for the whole game  then  with them  we know where
where we stand differs from where they stand  there s a sort of playing field of context  
causing the chair to squeak  marathe again rotated two fingers of a hand in the air  which for quebecers signifies impatience 
 rules of play  rules of engagement   the other hand was with the sterling ul machine pistol beneath the blanket 
 even historically   the   s bomb tossers  the spic separatists  the ragheads   
 very charming  these are attractive terms  
 ragheads  colombians  brazilians   they had positive objectives  
 desires for self which you could understand  
 even if the objectives were nothing more than things we could file  pin to the board under  stated objectives    the
pathetic spies  they wanted certain things  there was a context  a compass for maneuvers against them  
 your guardians of national security could understand these positive desires of self interest  look at them and  relate  as one
says  at least  knowing where you stand on the field of play  
steeply slowly nodded  as if to only himself   there wasn t just pure malice  there was never the sense that here were some
people who had just all of a sudden let the air out of your tires for no reason  
 you allege we disperse our resources deflating automobile tires  
 a figure of speech  or for example a serial killer  a sadist  somebody who wants you down just for the deviant sake of
wanting you down  a deviant  
far south  a blinking system of tri colored lights described a spiral over the airport s tower s pulsing tip   this was a landing
aircraft 
steeply lit another cigarette off the butt of his previous and then tossed the butt  peering over the shelf s edge to watch its
spiralled fall  marathe was looking up and right  steeply said 
 because politics are one thing  even way out far in the distance fringe politics are one thing  your fortier doesn t seem to
care much about reconfiguration  territory  redemisement  cartography  tariffs  finlandization  o n a n ite anschluss or toxicwaste displacement  
 experialism  
steeply said  or so called experialism  even separatism  none of the other cells  agendas seem to drive you people  most of
the office sees it as just sheer malice with you  no agenda or story  
 and for you there is something appalling  
steeply pursed his lips  as if trying to blow something off them   but when there are delineatable strategic political goals and
objectives  when there s some set of ends we can make sense of the malice with  then it s just business  
 nothing of persons   marathe was looking up  some of the stars seemed to flutter  others to burn with more steadiness 
 we know which end is up when it s business  we ve got a field and a compass   he regarded marathe directly in a way that
was not accusing   this seems personal   he said 
marathe could not think of descriptions for the way steeply regarded him  neither was it sad nor inquisitive nor quite
ruminative  there were small flickers and shadows of movements around the flickers of the celebratory fire down far away on the
floor of the desert  marathe could not determine whether steeply was truly revealing emotions about himself  the flickers

 continually went out  small shreds of young laughter drifted up to them in the vacuous silence  there were also sometimes rustles
in the hillside s scrub  of gravel or small living nightly things  or whether perhaps steeply was trying to give him something  let
him know something and determine whether it went back to m  fortier  marathe s arrangement with the office of unspecified
services seemed most often to consist in submitting himself to numerous tests and games of truth and betrayal  he felt often with
u s o u s  like a caged rodent being regarded blandly by bland men in white coats 
marathe shrugged   u s a  has previously been hated  richly so  shining path and your maxwell house company  the translatin cocaine cartels and the poor late m  kemp with his exploding home  did not both iraq and iran call u s a  the very large
satan  as you hatefully say they have heads of rags  
steeply exhumed smoke quickly to reply   yes but there were still contexts and ends  revenue  religion  spheres of influence 
israel  petroleum  neo marxism  post cold war power jockeying  there was always a third thing  
 some desire  
 some piece of business  some third thing between them and us   it wasn t just us   it was something they wanted from us 
or wanted us out of   steeply seemed earnestly to say it  the third thing  the goal or desire   it mediated the ill will  abstracted it
somehow  
 for this is how one who is sane proceeds   marathe said  paying great concentration to aligning the blanket s hems against his
chest and wheels   some desire of self  and efforts expending to meet that desire  
 not just wanting negatives   steeply said  shaking the lurid head   not just wanting some other s harm for no purpose  
marathe again found himself pretending to sniff with the congestion   and a u s a  purpose  desires   this he asked quietly 
its sound was strange against stone 
steeply was pinching yet a next particle of tobacco from his lipstick  he said this you can t generalize on with most of us 
since our whole system is founded on your individual s freedom to pursue his own individual desires   his mascara had now
cooled in the formations of its past running  marathe kept silent and fussed with the blanket as steeply sometimes regarded him  a
whole minute passed this way  finally steeply said 
 me  for me personally  as an american  remy  if you re really serious  i think it s probably your standard old basic american
dreams and ideals  freedom from tyranny  from excessive want  fear  censorship of speech and thought   he was looking with
seriousness  even in this wig   the old ones  tested by time  relative plenty  meaningful work  adequate leisure time  the ones you
might call corny   his smiling revealed to marathe lipstick upon one incisor   we want choice  a sense of efficaciousness and
choice  to be loved by someone  to freely love who you happen to love  to be loved irregardless of whether you can tell them
classified stuff about your job  to have them just trust you and trust that you know what you re doing  to feel valued  not to be
agendalessly despised  to have good neighborly relations  cheap and abundant energy  pride in your work and family  and home  
the lipstick had been smeared onto the tooth when the finger had removed the grain of tobacco  he was  faisait monter la
pression          the little things  access to transport  good digestion  work saving appliances  a wife who doesn t mistake your
job s requirements for your own fetishes  reliable waste removal and disposal  sunsets over the pacific  shoes that don t cut off
circulation  frozen yogurt  a tall lemonade on a squeak free porch swing  
marathe s face  it showed nothing   the loyalty of a domestic pet  
steeply pointed the cigarette   there you go  friend  
 high quality entertainment  high value for the dollar of leisure and spectation  
steeply laughed agreeably  exhaling a shaped sausage of smoke  in response to this  marathe smiled  there was some silence
for thinking until marathe finally said  looking up and off to think   this u s a  type of person and desires appears to me like
almost the classic  how do you say  uti litaire  
 a french appliance  
 comme on dit   marathe said   utilitarienne  maximize pleasure  minimize displeasure  result  what is good  this is the u s a 
of you  
steeply pronounced the u s a  english word for marathe  then  then a sustained pause  steeply rose and fell upon his toes  a
bonfire of young persons was burning some k  down away on the desert floor  the flames burning in a seeming ring instead of a
sphere 
marathe said  but yes  but precisely whose pleasure and whose pain  in this personality type s equation of what is good  
when steeply removed a particle of the cigarette from the lip he would then roll it absently between his first finger and
thumb  this did not appear womanly   come again  
mara the scratched inside the wind breaker   i am wondering  me  in the equations of this u s a  type  the best good is each
individual u s a  person s maximum pleasure  or it is the maximum pleasure for all the people  
steeply nodded in a way that indicated willing patience with someone whose wits were not too speedy   but there you go  but
this question itself shows how our different types of national character part ways from each other  remy  the american genius 
our good fortune is that someplace along the line back there in american history them realizing that each american seeking to
pursue his maximum good results together in maximizing everyone s good  
 ah  
 we learn this as early as grade school  as kids  
 i am seeing  
 this is what lets us steer free of oppression and tyranny  even your greekly democratic howling mob type tyranny  the
united states  a community of sacred individuals which reveres the sacredness of the individual choice  the individual s right to
pursue his own vision of the best ratio of pleasure to pain  utterly sacrosanct  defended with teeth and bared claws all through our
history  
 bien sur  
steeply for the first time seemed to be feeling with his hand his wig s disorder  he was attempting to straightly reposition it
without removing the wig  marathe tried not to envision what his b s s  had done to the natural brown male hair of steeply  to
accommodate the complex wig  steeply said   it might be hard for you to quite understand what s so precious about this for us 

 from across this chasm of different values that separates our peoples  
marathe flexed his hand   perhaps because it is so general and abstracted  in practice  however  you may force me to
understand  
 we don t force  it s exactly about not forcing  our history s genius  you are entitled to your values of maximum pleasure  so
long as you don t fuck with mine  are you seeing  
 perhaps help me see by practical evidence  an instance  suppose you are able at one moment to increase your own pleasure 
but the cost of this is the displeasuring pain of another  another sacred individual s displeasing pain  
steeply said   well now this is precisely what gives us the fantods about the a f r   why it s so important i think to remember
how we come from different cultures and value systems  remy  because in our u s  value system  anybody who derives an
increase in pleasure from somebody else s pain is a deviant  a sadistic sicko  and is thereby excluded from the community of
everybody s right to pursue their own best pleasure to pain ratio 
sickos deserve compassion and the best treatment feasible  but they re not part of the big picture  
marathe willed himself not to rise on his stumps again   no  but not another s pain as a pleasurable end in itself  i did not
mean where my pleasure is in your pain  how to say better  imagine there arises a situation in which your deprivation or pain is
merely the consequence  the price  of my own pleasure  
 you mean you re talking a tough choices  limited resources type situation  
 but in the simplest of examples  the most child like case   marathe s eyes momentarily gleamed with enthusiasm   suppose
that you and i  we both wish to enjoy a hot bowl of the habitant soupe aux pois  
steeply said  you mean      
 but yes  french canadian type pea soup  produit du montreal  saveur maison  prete a servir        
 what is it with you people and this stuff  
 in this case imagining both you and i are in the worst way craving for habitant soup  but there is one can only  of the small
and well known single serving size  
 an american invention  by the way  the   s  let s insert  
the part of marathe s mind that hovered above and watched coldly  it could not know whether steeply was being deliberately
parodically dense and annoying  to arouse marathe to some revealing passion  marathe made his rotary gesture of impatience 
slowly   but ok   he said neutrally   it is simple here  we both want the soup  so me  my pleasure from eating the habitant soupe
aux pois has the price of your pain at not eating soup when you badly crave it   marathe was patting his pockets for something 
 and the reverse  if you are who eats this serving  by the u s a  genius of for each  pursuivre le bonheur         then  who can
decide who may receive this soup  
steeply stood with weight on one leg   example s a bit oversimplified  we bid on the soup  maybe  we negotiate  maybe we
divide the soup  
 no  for the ingenious single serving size of serving is notoriously for only one  and we are both large and vigorous u s a 
individuals who have spent the afternoon watching huge men in pads and helmets hurl themselves at one another in the high
definition of interlace  and we are both ravenous for the satiation of a complete hot bowl s serving  half the bowl would only
torment this craving i have  
the fast shadow of pain across the face of steeply showed marathe s choice of example was witty  the divorced u s a  man
has much experience with the small size of single serving products  marathe said 
 ok  ok  yes  why should i  as the sacred individual  give you half of my soup  my own pleasure over torment is what is
good  for i am a loyal u s a   a genius of this individual desire  
the bonfire slowly was filling out  another cross of colored lights circled the airport area of tucson  steeply s movements of
smoothing the wig and twisting fingers through the snarls of hair became perhaps more abrupt and frustrated  steeply said  well
whose soup is it legally  who actually bought the soup  
marathe shrugged   not relevant for my question  suppose a third party  now unfortunately deceased  he appears at our flat
with a can oisoupe aux pots to eat while watching recorded u s a  sporting and suddenly is clutching his heart and falls to the
carpeting deceased  holding the soup we are now both so wishing  
 then we bid on the soup  whoever s got the most desire for the soup and is willing to fork over the higher price buys out the
other s half  then the other just jogs on down   jogs or rolls on down to safeway and buys himself some more soup  whoever s
willing to put his money where his hunger is gets the dead guy s soup  
marathe shook his head without any heat   the safeway store and bidding  these are also not relevant to my question i hope
the example of pea soup to raise  which perhaps this is a dull witted question  
steeply was at the wig with both hands  for repair  former perspiration had mashed its form inward on one side  as well as
small clots and small burrs from the falls of his descent to the outcropping  presumably there was no comb or brushes in his small
evening s wear purse  the rear of his dress was dirty  the straps of his prostheses  brassiere dug cruelly into the meat of his back
and shoulders  again there was for marathe the picture of something soft being slowly throttled 
steeply was responding  no  i know what you want to raise all right  you want to talk politics  scarcity and allocating and
tough choices  all right  politics we can understand  all right  politics we can discuss  i bet i know where you re   you want to
raise the question of what prevents     million individual american happiness pursuers from all going around bonking each other
over the head and taking each other s soup  a state of nature  my own pleasure and to hell with all the rest  
marathe had his handkerchief out   what does this wish to mean  this bonking  
 because this simplistic example shows just how far apart across the chasm our people s values are  friend   steeply was
saying this   because a certain basic amount of respect for the wishes of other people is required  is in my interest  in order to
preserve a community where my own wishes and interests are respected  ok  my total and overall happiness is maximized by
respecting your individual sanctity and not simply kicking you in the knee and running off with the soup   steeply watched
marathe blow one nostril into the handkerchief  marathe was one of the rare types who did not examine the hankie after he blew 
steeply said 

  and but then i can anticipate somebody on your side of the chasm retorting with something like  quote  yes my very good
ami  but what if your rival for the pleasurable soup is some individual outside your community  for example  you ll say  let s just
make the example that it a hapless canadian  foreign   mm autre   separated from me by a chasm of history and language and
value and deep respect for individual freedom   then in this wholly random instance there would be no community minded
constraints on my natural impulse to bonk your head and commandeer the desired soup  since the poor canadian is outside the
equation of  pursuivre le bonheur  of each individual  since he is not a part of the community whose environment of mutual
respect i depend on for pursuing my interest of maximal pleasure to pain  
marathe  during this time  was smiling up and to the left  north  rolling his head like a blind person  his favorite personal
place of off duty in the u s a  s city boston was in the public garden of summer  a broad and treeless declivity leading down to
the mare des canards  the duck pond  a grassy wedge facing south and west so that the grass of the slope turns pale green and then
gold as the sun circles over the head  the pond s water cool and muddy green and overhung with impressionist willows  persons
beneath the willows  also pigeons  and ducks with tight emerald heads gliding in circles  their eyes round stones  moving as if
without effort  gliding upon the water as if legless below  like films  idylls in cities the moment before the nuclear blast  in old
films of u s a  death and horror  he was missing this time in u s a  boston ma of refilling the pond for the ducks  return  the
willows greening  the winelight of a northern sunset curving gently in to land without explosion  children flew taut kites and
adults lay supine on the slope absorbing the suntan  eyes closed as if in concentration  he was giving out a small and desolate
smile  as of fatigue  his wrist s watch was unilluminated  steeply threw a butt without turning away from marathe to watch it fall 
 and you ll accuse me of you ll say i won t only poke him in the eye and commandeer the whole serving of soup for myself  
steeply said   but will  after eating it  i ll give him the dirty bowl and spoon and maybe even the no deposit habitant can to have to
deal with  saddle him with my greed s waste  all under some sham arrangement of quote interdependence that s really just a crude
nationalist scheme to indulge my own u s  individual pleasure lust without the complications or annoyance of considering some
neighbor s own desires and interests  
marathe said  you will notice that i do not with sarcasm say  and herrrrrrrrrre we go off together once more   which you
enjoy saying  
steeply s use of the body to shelter the lighting match for his smoking was not feminine  either  his parody of marathe s
accent sounded guttural and u s a  cajun with the cigarette in the mouth  he looked up past the flame   but no  am i off base  
marathe had an almost buddhist way of studying the blanket on his lap 
for some seconds he behaved as if almost asleep  nodding very smally with the rise and fall of his lungs  the ponderous
rectangles of moving light within tucson s nightly spread were  barges of land  ministering to nests of dump sters in the deep part
of night  part of marathe always felt almost a desire to shoot persons who anticipated his responses and inserted words and said
they were from marathe  not letting him speak  marathe suspected steeply of knowing this  sensing this in marathe  all two of
marathe s older brothers from childhood had engaged in this  arguing every side and silencing remy by inserting his words  both
had kissed trains head on before reaching marriageable age        marathe had been part of the audience for the death of the
better one  some of the barges of land s waste would be vectored into the sonora region of mexico  but much would be shipped
north for displacement launch into the convexity  steeply was regarding him 
 no  remy  am i off base in terms of what you d say  
the smile around marathe s mouth cost him all his training in restraint   the cans containing habitant  they say boldly
 veuillez recycler ce conte nant   you are not false  maybe  but i think i am asking less for nations  arguing and more for the
example of you and me only  we two  if we pretend we are both of your u s a  type  each separate  both sacred  both desiring
soupe aux pots  i am asking how is community and your respect part of my happiness in this moment  with the soup  if i am a
u s a  person  
steeply worked a finger under one strap of the brassiere to relieve the throttling pressure  t don t get you  
 well  we both crave badly the entire recyclable single serving can of this habitant   marathe sniffed  tn my mind i know it
is true that i must not simply make a bonking of your head and take away the soup  because my overall happiness of pleasure of
the long term needs a community of  rien de bonk         but this is the long term  steeply  this is down the road of my
happiness  this respecting of you  how do i calculate this distant road of long term into my action of this moment  now  with our
dead comrade clutching the soup and both of us with spittle on our chins as we regard the soup  my question is trying to say  if
the most pleasure right now  en ce moment  is in the whole serving of habitant  how is my self able to put aside this moment s
desire to make bonk on you and take this soup  how am i able to think past this soup to the future of soup down my road  
tn other words delayed gratification  
 good  this is well  delayed gratification  how is my u s a  type able in my mind to calculate my long term overall
pleasure  then decide to sacrifice this intense soup craving of this moment to the long term and overall  
steeply sent out two hard tusks of smoke from the nostrils of his nose  his expression was one of patience together with polite
impatience  t think it s called simply being a mature and adult american instead of a childish and immature american  a term we
might use might be  enlightened self interest  
 d eclaisant  
steeply  he did not smile back   enlightened  for example your example from before  the little kid who ll eat candy all day
because it s what tastes best at each individual moment  
 even if he knows inside his mind that it will hurt his stomach and rot his little fangs  
 teeth   steeply corrected   but see that here it can t be a fascist matter of screaming at the kid or giving him electric shocks
each time he overindulges in candy  you can t induce a moral sensibility the same way you d train a rat  the kid has to learn by his
own experience how to learn to balance the short  and long term pursuit of what he wants  
 he must be freely enlightened to self  
 this is the crux of the educational system you find so appalling  not to teach what to desire  to teach how to be free  to
teach how to make knowledgeable choices about pleasure and delay and the kid s overall down the road maximal interests  
marathe farted mildly into his cushion  nodding as if with thought 

  and i know what you ll say   steeply said   and no  the system isn t perfect  there is greed  there is crime  there are drugs and
cruelty and ruin and infidelity and divorce and suicide  murder  
 to bonk the head  
steeply again dug at this strap  he would snap open the purse and then pause to move the brassiere s tight strap and then dig
into the purse  which sounded femininely full and cluttered  he said  but this is just the price  this is the price of the free pursuit 
not everybody learns it in childhood  how to balance his interests  
marathe tried to envision thin men with horn rim spectacles and natural shoulder sportcoats or white coats of the laboratory 
carefully packing with clutter the purse of a field operative to create the female effect  now steeply had his pack of flanderfumes
cigarettes and his finger of pinkie in the pack s hole  evidently trying to gauge how many were left  venus was low in the
northeast rim  when marathe s wife was born as an infant without a skull  there had been at first suspicion that the cause was that
her parents smoked cigarettes as a habit  the light of the stars and moon had become sullen  the moon had not yet set  it seemed
as if sometimes the bonfire of youthful mafficking was there and then when the eyes were averted in the next moment it was not
there  time was passing in a silence  steeply was using a nail to extract slowly one of the cigarettes  marathe  as a small child and
with legs  had always disliked persons who made comments about how much others smoked  steeply now had learned here just
how he must stand to keep the match alive  some wind had died down  but there were scattered chill gusts that it seemed came
from nowhere  marathe sniffed so deeply that it became a sigh  the struck match sounded loud  there was no echo 
marathe sniffed again and said 
 but of these types of your persons   the different types  the mature who see down the road  the puerile type that eats the
candy and soup in the moment only  entre nous  here on this shelf  hugh steeply  which do you think describes the u s a  of
o n a n  and the great convexity  this u s a  you feel pain that others might wish to harm   hands which shake out matches act
always as if they are burned  this motion of snapping  marathe sniffed   are you understanding  i am asking between only us 
how could it be that a f r  malice could hurt all of the u s a  culture by making available something as momentary and free as
the choice to view only this one entertainment  you know there can be no forcing to watch a thing  if we disseminate the
samizdat  the choice will be free  no  free from force  no  yes  freely chosen  
m  hugh steeply of b s s  was standing then with his weight on one hip and looked his most female when he smoked  with
his elbow in his arm and the hand to his mouth and the back of this hand to marathe  a type of fussy ennui that reminded marathe
of women in hats and padded shoulders in black and white films  smoking  marathe said 
 you believe we are underestimating to see all you as selfish  decadent  but the question has been raised  are we cells of
canada alone in this view  aren t you afraid  you of your government and gendarmes  if not  your b s s   why work so hard to
prevent dissemination  why make a simple entertainment  no matter how seducing its pleasures  a samizdat and forbidden in the
first place  if you do not fear so many u s a s cannot make the enlightened choices  
this now was the closest large steeply had come  to stand over marathe to look down  looming  the rising astral body venus
lit his left side of the face to the color of pallid cheese   get real  the entertainment isn t candy or beer  look at boston just now 
you can t compare this kind of insidious enslaving process to your little cases of sugar and soup  
marathe smiled bleakly into the chiaroscuro flesh of this round and hairless u s a  face   perhaps the facts are true  after the
first watching  that then there seems to be no choice  but to decide to be this pleasurably entertained in the first place  this is still
a choice  no  sacred to the viewing self  and free  no  yes  
during that last pre subsidized year  after each tournament s perfunctory final  at the little post final award presentations and
dance  eric clipperton would attend unarmed and eat maybe a little shaved turkey from the buffet and mutter out of the side of his
slot like mouth to mario incandenza  and would stand there expressionless and receive his outsized first place trophy amid
witheringly slight and scattered applause  and would melt into the crowd soon after and dematerialize back to wherever he lived
and trained and target practiced  clipperton by this time must have had a whole mantel plus bookcase s worth of tall u s t a 
trophies  each u s t a  trophy a marbled plastic base with a tall metal boy on top arched in mid serve  looking rather like a
wedding cake groom with a very good outside slider  clipper ton must have been just broke out in brass and plastic  but he had no
official ranking whatsoever  since his clock   mm  and public intentions were instantly legendary  he was regarded by the
u s t a  as never having had a legitimate victory  or even a legit match  in sanctioned play  people on the jr  tour sometimes
asked tiny mario if that s why eric clipperton always seemed so terrifically glum and withdrawn and made such a big deal out of
materializing and dematerializing at tournaments  that the very tactic that let him win in the first place kept the wins  and in a way
clipperton himself  from being treated as real 
all this until the erection of o n a n  and the inception  in clipperton s eighteenth summer  of subsidized time  the adverted
year of the whopper  when the u s t a  became the o n a n t a  and some mexican systems analyst   who barely spoke
english and had never once even fondled a ball and knew from exactly zilch except for crunching raw results data   this guy
stepped in as manager of the o n a n t a  computer and ranking center in forest lawn nny  and didn t know enough not to
treat clipperton s string of six major junior tournament championships that spring as sanctioned and real  and when the first
biweekly issue of the trilingual north american junior tennis that s replaced american junior tennis comes out  there s one e  r 
clipperton  home town  ind    ranked    in boys  continental    and unders  and competitive eyebrows ascend at all latitudes 
and but everyone at e t a   from schtitt on down  is highly amused  and some of them wonder whether maybe now eric
clipperton will put down his psychic cuirass and take his unarmed competitive chances with the rest of them  now that he s got
what he s surely been burning over and holding himself hostage for all along  a real and sanctioned     and the continental jr 
clay courts are coming up the following week  in indianapolis in  and little michael pemulis of allston takes his powerbook and
odds software and makes a killing on vig in the frenzy of locker room wagering over whether clipperton ll even bother to
materialize at indy now that he s extorted himself to the sanctioned top he must have craved so terribly  or whether he ll retire
from the tour now and lie around masturbating over the clock in one hand and the latest issue of najt in the other        and
so everyone s taken aback when eric clipperton of all people suddenly appears at the e t a  front gate s portcullis on a rainy
warm late a m  two days before the clays  wearing a flap frayed trench type coat and toe abraded sneakers and a five day growth
of armpitty adolescent beard  but without any sticks or anything in the way of competitive gear  not even his clock    s custom 

 made wooden case  and he makes the cold eyed part time portcullis attendant from the halfway place down the hill just about lean
on the intercom buzzer  pleading for entry and counsel   he s in a terrible way  is the portcullis attendant s intercom diagnosis  
and rules about nonenrolled jr  players being on academies  grounds are strict and complex  and but little mario incandenza sways
down the steep path to the portcullis in the warm rain and interfaces with clipperton through the bars and has the attendant hold
the intercom button down for him and personally requests that clipperton be admitted under a special nonplay codicil to the
regulations  saying the kid is truly in desperate psychic straits  mario speaking first to lateral alice moore and then to this
prorector cantrell and then to the headmaster himself as clipperton stares wordlessly up at the little wrought iron racquet heads
that serve as spikes at the top of the portcullis and fencing around e t a   his expression so blackly haunted that even the hardboiled attendant told some of the people back at the halfway place later that the spectral trench coated figure had given him
sobriety s worst fantods  so far  and j  o  incandenza finally lets clipperton in over cantrelps and then schtitt s vehement
objections when it s established that clipperton wants only a few private minutes to obtain the counsel of incandenza sr 
himself of whom i think we can presume mario s spoken glowingly to clipperton   and incandenza  while not quite strictly
sober  is lucid  and has a very low melting point of compassion for traumas connected with early success  and so up goes the
portcullis  and the clipperton and the two incandenzas go at high noon up to an unused top floor room in subdorm c of east
house  the structure nearest the front gate  for some sort of psycho existential cpr session or something   mario has never
spoken of what he got to sit in on  not even at night to hal when hal s trying to go to sleep  but it s a matter of record that at some
point first e t a  counselor dolores rusk was beeped by himself at her winchester home and then her beep was canceled and
lateral alice moore was beeped and asked with due speed to get lyle up from the weight room sauna and over to east house
asap  and that at some point while lyle was delotusing from the dispenser and making his way with sideways lateral alice to
this emergency type huddle  at some point in this interval   in front of dr  james o  incandenza and a mario whose tiny
borrowed head clamped bolex h    incandenza required clipperton to consent to having digitally record the whole crisisconversation  to protect e t a  from the o n a n t a  s kafkaesque rules on unregistered recipients of any sort of counsel at u s 
academies   at some point  w  lyle in transit  clipperton pulls out of various pockets in his wet complicated coat an elaborately
altered copy of najt s biweekly ranking report  a sepia d snapshot of some whey faced midwestern couple s wedding  and the
hideous blunt barreled clock     mm  semiautomatic  which even as both incandenzas reach for the sky clipperton places to his
right   not left   temple  as in with his good right stick hand  closes his eyes and scrunches up his face and blows his
legitimated brains out for real and all time  eradicates his map and then some  and there s just an ungodly subsequent mess in
there  and the incandenzas respectively stagger and totter from the room all green gilled and red mist stained  and   because
reports of lyle s appearance outside the weight room upright and walking across the grounds have spread and caused enormous
excitement and student snapshots   it s because it was just as lyle and l  a  moore hit the upstairs hallway that they reeled out
of the room in a miasma of cordite and ghastly mist that they re preserved in various snapshots as resembling miners of some sort
of really grisly coal 
people in the competitive jr  tennis community somehow regarded it as healthy that mario incandenza s perfectly even smile
never faltered even through tears at clipperton s funeral  the funeral was poorly attended  it turned out eric clipperton had hailed
from crawfordsville  indiana  where his ma was a late stage valium addict and his ex soybean farmer pa  blinded in the infamous
hailstorms of b s       now spent all day every day playing with one of those little wooden paddles with a red rubber ball attached
by elastic string  paddle ball  with an understandable lack of success  and the tranquilized and sightless clippertons had had no
clue about where eric had even disappeared off to most weekends  and bought his explanation that all the tall trophies came from
an after school job as a freelance tennis trophy designer  the parents apparently being not exactly the two brightest bulbs in the
great u s  parental light show  they held the interment under a threat of rain in veedersburg in  where there s a budget cemetery 
and himself skipped indianapolis and took mario to the first of his life s two funerals so far  and it was probably moving that
incandenza acceded to mario s request that nothing get filmed or documented  at the funeral  for himself s jr  tennis documentary 
mario probably told lyle all about everything  back down in the weight room  but he sure never told hal or the moms  and
himself was already in and out of rehabs and hardly a credible source on much of anything by this point  but incandenza did let
mario insist that no one else get to clean up the scene in subdorm c after enfield s finest had come and peered around and drawn
a chalk ectoplasm around clipperton s sprawled form and written things down in little spiral notebooks which they kept checking
against one another with maddening care  and then emts had zipped clipperton up in a huge rubber bag and taken him down and
out on a wheeled stretcher with retractable legs they had to retract on all the stairs  lyle was long gone by this time  it took the
bradykinetic mario all night and two bottles of ajax plus to clean the room with his tiny contractured arms and square feet  the
   s girls in the rooms on either side could hear him falling around in there and picking himself up  again and again  and the
finally spotless room in question had been locked ever since  with its tasteless sign   except g  schtitt holds a special key  and
when an e t a  jr  whinges too loudly about some tennis connected vicissitude or hardship or something  he s invited to go chill
for a bit in the clip perton suite  to maybe meditate on some of the other ways to succeed besides votaried self transcendence and
gut sucking in and hard daily slogging toward a distant goal you can then maybe  if you get there  live with 
it was ennet house s assistant director annie p  who coined the phrase that don gately  sunlights on the side   five a m s a
week  whether he s just getting off all night staff duty or not  he has to be on the inbound green line by     h  to then catch two
more trains to his other job at the shat tuck shelter for homeless males down in bombed out jamaica plain  gately has become 
in sobriety  a janitor  he mops down broad cot strewn floors with anti fungal delousing solvents  likewise the walls  he scrubs
toilets  the relative cleanliness of the shattuck s toilets might seem surprising until you head into the shower area  with your
equipment and face mask  half the guys in the shattuck are always incontinent  there s human waste in the showers on a daily
fucking basis  stavros lets him attach an industrial hose to a nozzle and spray the worst of the shit away from a distance before
gately has to go in there with his mop and brushes and solvents  and his mask 
cleaning the shattuck only takes three hours  since he and his partner got the routine down tight  gately s partner is also the
guy that owns the company that contracts with the commonwealth for the shattuck s maintenance  a guy like forty or fifty 
stavros lobokulas  a troubling guy with a long cigarette filter and an enormous collection of women s shoes catalogues he keeps
piled behind the seats in the cab of his  x  

 so at like      usually they re done and by vendor s contract still get to bill for eight hours  stavros l  only pays gately for
three  but it s sub table   and gately heads back to government center to take the westbound greenie back up commonwealth to
ennet house to put on his black eye patch mask thing and sleep till   ooh  and the afternoon shift  stavros l  himself gets a
couple hours off to footwear browse  gately very much needs to assume that s all he does with the catalogues  is browse   then
has to head over to pine street inn  the biggest and foulest homeless shelter in all of boston  where stavros and two other broke
and desperate yutzes from another of the halfway houses stavros cruises for cheap labor will spend four hours cleaning and then
bill the state for six 
the inmates at the shattuck suffer from every kind of physical and psychological and addictive and spiritual difficulty you
could ever think of  specializing in ones that are repulsive  there are colostomy bags and projectile vomiting and cirrhotic
discharges and missing limbs and misshapen heads and incontinence and kaposi s sarcoma and suppurating sores and all different
levels of enfeeblement and impulse control deficit and damage  schizophrenia is like the norm  guys in d t s treat the heaters
like tvs and leave broad spatter paintings of coffee over the walls of the barrackses  there are industrial buckets for a m  puking
that they seem to treat like golfers treat the pin on like a golf course  aiming in its vague direction from a distance  there s one sort
of blocked off and more hidden corner  over near the bank of little lockers for valuables  that s always got sperm moving slowly
down the walls  and way too much sperm for just one or two guys  either  the whole place smells like death no matter what the
fuck you do  gately gets to the shelter at       h  and just shuts his head off as if his head has a kind of control switch  he screens
input with a fucking vengeance the whole time  the barrackses s cots reek of urine and have insect activity observable  the state
employees who supervise the shelter at night are dead eyed and watch soft core tapes behind the desk and are all around gately s
size and build  and he s been approached to maybe work there himself  nights  supervising  more than once  and has said thanks
anyway  and always screws right out of there at o olh  and rides the greenie back up the hill with his gratitude battery totally
recharged 
janitoring the shattuck for stavros lobokulas was the menial job gately had landed with only three days to go on his month s
deadline to find some honest job  as a resident  and he s kept it ever since 
the males in the shattuck are supposed to be up and out by o ooh  regardless of weather or d t s  to let gately and stavros
l  clean  but some never screw out of there on time   and these re always the worst guys  the ones you don t want anyplace near
you  these ones that won t leave  they ll clump behind gately and watch him jet feces off the shower tiling  treating it like a sport
and yelling encouragement and advice  they ll cringe and ass kiss when the supervisor heaves himself on by to tell them to get out
and then when he leaves not get out  a couple have those little shaved patches on their arms  they ll lie in the cots and hallucinate
and thrash and scream in the cots and knock army blankets off onto the floors gately s trying to mop  they ll skulk back over to
the little dark spermy corner the minute gately s got done scrubbing the night s sperm off and has backed away and started again
to inhale 
maybe the worst is that there s almost always one or two guys in the shattuck who gately knows personally  from his days of
addiction and b e  from before he got to the no choice point and surrendered his will to staying straight at any cost  these guys
are always       and look       and are a better ad for sobriety at any cost than any ad agency could come up with  gately ll slip
them a finski or a pack of kools and maybe sometimes try and talk a little aa to them  if they seem like maybe they re ready to
give up  with everybody else in the shattuck gately adopts this expression where he lets them know he s ignoring them totally as
long as they keep their distance  but it s a look that says street and jail and not to fuck with him  if they get in his way  gately will
stare hard at a point just behind their heads until they move off  the protective face mask helps 
stavros lobokulas s great ambition   which he goes on about regularly to gately when they re cleaning the same barracks  
stavros s dream is to utilize his unique combination of entrepreneurial drives and janitorial savvy and flairs for creative billing and
finding desperate recovering halfway house guys who ll scrub shit for next to nothing  to pile up enough   to open a women s shoe
store in some mobilely upward part of boston where the women are healthy and upscale and have good feet and can afford to take
care of their feet  gately spends a lot of the time around stavros nodding and not saying really much of anything  because what is
there to really say about ambitious career dreams involving feet  but gately ll be paying court scheduled restitution well into his
thirties if he stays straight  and needs the work  foot thing or no foot thing  stavros has allegedly been clean for eight years  but
gately has his private doubts about the spiritual quality of the sobriety involved  e g  like stavros gets easily aggravated at the
shattuck guys that can t get up and out like they re supposed to and clear out  and almost daily he ll make a production of throwing
down his mop in the middle of the floor and throwing his head back to scream   why don t you sorry motherfucks just go home  
which so far for over thirteen months he hasn t quit finding hilarious  his own witticism  stavros 
but the whole clipperton saga highlights the way there are certain very talented jr  players who just cannot keep the lip stiff
and fires stoked if they ever finally do achieve a top ranking or win some important event  next to clipperton  the most
historically ghastly instance of this syndrome involved a kid from fresno  in central ca  also an unaffiliated kid  his dad  an
architect or draftsman or something  functioned as his coach  his dad had played for uc davis or  irvine or one of those  all the
e t a  staff really emphasize is that again here was a kid w o academy support and  perspective   who  after upsetting two top
seeds and winning the pacific coast hardcourt boys    s and getting toasted wildly at the post tourney ceremony and ball and
carried off on the shoulders of his dad and fresno teammates  came home late that night and drank a big glass of nestle s quik
laced with the sodium cyanide his dad kept around for ink for drafting  drinks cyanitic quik in his family s home s redecorated
kitchen  and keels over dead  blue faced and still with a ghastly mouthful of lethal quik  and apparently his dad hears the thump
of the kid keeling over and rushes into the kitchen in his bathrobe and leather slippers and tries to give the kid mouth to mouth
resuscitation  and but gets the odd bit of nacn laced quik in his own mouth  from the kid  and also keels over and turns bright
blue  and dies  and then the mom rushes in in a mud mask and fluffy slippers and sees them both lying there bright blue and
stiffening  and she tries giving the architect dad mouth to mouth and is of course in short order also lying there keeled over and
blue  wherever she s not mud colored  from the mask  and but anyway dead as a rivet  and since the family has six more variousaged kids who as the night wears on come in from dates or patter down the stairs in little pajamas with adorable little pajama feet
attached to them  drawn by the noise of all the cumulative keeling over  plus i should mention the odd agonized gurgle sound  and
but since all six kids had gone through a four hour rotary sponsored cpr course at fresno s ymca  by the end of the night the

 whole family s lying there blue hued and stiff as posts  with incrementally tinier amounts of lethal quik smeared around their
rictus grimaced mouths  and in sum this whole instance of unprepared goal attaintment trauma is unbelievably gruesome and sad 
and it s one historical reason why all accredited tennis academies have to have a ph d  level counselor on full time staff  to screen
student athletes for their possibly lethal reactions to ever actually reaching the level they ve been pointed at for years  e t a  s
staff counselor is the bird of prey faced dr  dolores rusk  m s   ph d   and she s regarded by the kids as whatever s just slightly
worse than useless  you go in there with an issue and all she ll do is make a cage of her hands and look abstractly over the cage at
you and take the last dependent clause of whatever you say and repeat it back to you with an interrogative lilt    possible homosexual attraction to your doubles partner    whole sense of yourself as a purposive male athlete messed with    uncontrolled
boner during semis at cleveland    drives you bats when people just parrot you instead of responding    having trouble keeping
from twisting my twittery head off like a game hen s     all with an expression she probably thinks looks blandly deep but which
really looks exactly the way a girl s face looks when she s dancing with you but would really rather be dancing with just about
anyone else in the room  only the very newest e t a  players ever go to rusk  and then not for long  and she spends her massive
blocks of free time in her comm  ad  office doing involved acrostics and working on some sort of pop psych manuscript the first
four pages of which axford and shaw dick ied her lock and had a look at and counted    appearances of the prefix self   lyle  a
dewimpled carmelite who works the kitchen day shift  occasionally mario incandenza  and many times avril herself take up most
of the psychic slack  for practical purposes  among e t a s in the know 
it s possible that the only jr  tennis players who can win their way to the top and stay there without going bats are the ones
who are already bats  or else who seem to be just grim machines a la john wayne  wayne s sitting low on his spine in the dining
hall with the other canadian kids  watching the screen and squeezing a ball without any readable expression  hal s eyes are
fevered and rolling around in his head  and actually by this time a lot of the eyes in the i  day audience have lost a bit of that
festive sparkle  though there s a certain chortle momentum left over from the film s self felonious gentle clipperton
comparisons  the rodney tine luria p  love rumor and tine as benedict arnold thing seems brow clutchingly slow and digressive        plus there s some retroactive puzzlement  because the advent of subsidized time is historically known to have been a
revenue response to the heady costs of the u s  s reconfigurative giveaway  which means it must have come after formal
interdependence  and indeed in the film it does come after  but then the chronology of some of the end makes it seem like tine
sold johnny gentle on his whole sino temporal endorsement revenue scheme sometime in orin incandenza s first major sport
year at boston u   which ended in the year of the whopper  pretty obviously a subsidized year  by this time the e t a s are
eating more slowly  playing in that idle post prandial way with the orts on their plates  and people s hats are making some people s
heads itch  and plus everybody s sugar crashing a bit  and one of the really small e t a  kids crawling around with a bottle of
adhesive under the tables has whacked his head on the sharp edge of an institutional chair and is in avril i  s lap crying with a
desolate late day hysteria that makes everybody feel jagged

gentle  ouster  boys  seminal  visionary  an outstanding experience  i now say things like outstanding instead of boss  but
also seminal  ollie  men  i saw something outstandingly visional and seminary yesterday  i do not refer to the football game  i
normally don t much get into football  all that grunting  mud everywhere  not my scene ordinarily  the most diverting single
thing of the game was one of the two teams  punters  this one slim cat with an outsized leg and slightly less outsized arm  never
saw punts i could hear before  whoom  blam  i ate an entire wiener stem to stern while one punt was in the air  people stood
around conferring and making a racket and going to the restroom and coming back and eating concessions  all while this one cat s

rodney tine  chief  united states office of unspecified services  president gentle s asked us all here this morning to put our
collective expertise together on an issue about which we in unspecified services believe he s been hit with a truly seminal set of
creative insights 
gentle  gentlemen  we re both pleased and concerned to report that our seminal experiment in the territorial reconfiguration

 of o n a n        has been a thoroughgoing logistical coup  more or less  delaware s looking a bit crowded  and one or two
curvy horned animals apparently got by the tactical squads  and there s rather less overall good sportsmanship in downstate new
new york than we d like to see  but overall i think  thoroughgoing coup  would not be out of line as a term to describe this sort of
success 
tine  now it s time to think about how to pay for it 
all secs    stiff turns to look at each other  tie  and mustache straightenings  gulping sounds  
gentle  rod informs me marty s got the preliminary figures on gross costs  while chef s boys have provided us with some
projections on gross revenue losses from the reconfiguration of taxable territories and households and businesses and that there

explain that despite a quantitative downer type quality to these figures  all we merely have here is just what rod might call an
exaggerated example of a quadrennial problem any administration with vision is going to have to face eventually anyway  by the

puppet simply beyond pulchritudinous belief  the cabinet room s conference table seems to ascend ever so slightly as luria p        cocks a well pencilled eyebrow  
still tine  gentlemen  what the president is articulating is that what we face here is a microsmic exemplar of the infamous
democratic triple bind faced by visionarians from fdr and jfk on down  the american electorate  as is its every right  on one
hand demands the sort of millennial statesmanship and vision   decisive action  tough choices  lots of programs and services  
see for instance the territorial reconfiguration for example   that will lead a renewed community into a whole new era of
interdependent choice and freedom 
gentle  the rhetorical chapeau s off to you  babe 
tine  rising  eyes now two glittery red points in his round face s felt  the eyes two tiny smoke detector bulbs run off a single

dictates the tough choice of cutting certain programs and services  our statistical people predict with reasonable inductive certainty
that the american electorate will whinge

year of the depend adult undergarment
on a white flag group commitment to the tough shit but you still can t drink group down in braintree this past july 
don g   up at the podium  revealed publicly about how he was ashamed that he still as yet had no real solid understanding of a
higher power  it s suggested in the  rd of boston aa s    steps that you to turn your diseased will over to the direction and love
of  god as you understand him   it s supposed to be one of aa s major selling points that you get to choose your own god  you
get to make up your own understanding of god or a higher power or whom  whatever  but gately  at like ten months clean  at
the tsbyscd podium in braintree  opines that at this juncture he s so totally clueless and lost he s thinking that he d maybe rather
have the white flag crocodiles just grab him by the lapels and just tell him what aa god to have an understanding of  and give
him totally blunt and dogmatic orders about how to turn over his diseased will to whatever this higher power is  he notes how
he s observed already that some catholics and fundamentalists now in aa had a childhood understanding of a stern and
punishing type god  and gately s heard them express incredible gratitude that aa let them at long last let go and change over to
an understanding of a loving  forgiving  nurturing type god  but at least these folks started out with some idea of him her it 
whether fucked up or no  you might think it d be easier if you came in with   in the way of denominational background or
preconceptions  you might think it d be easier to sort of invent a higher powerish god from scratch and then like erect an
understanding  but don gately complains that this has not been his experience thus far  his sole experience so far is that he takes
one of aa s very rare specific suggestions and hits the knees in the a m  and asks for help and then hits the knees again at bedtime
and says thank you  whether he believes he s talking to anything body or not  and he somehow gets through that day clean  this 
after ten months of ear smoking concentration and reflection  is still all he feels like he  understands  about the  god angle  
publicly  in front of a very tough and hard ass looking aa crowd  he sort of simultaneously confesses and complains that he feels
like a rat that s learned one route in the maze to the cheese and travels that route in a ratty type fashion and whatnot  w  the god
thing being the cheese in the metaphor  gately still feels like he has no access to the big spiritual picture  he feels about the
ritualistic daily please and thank you prayers rather like like a hitter that s on a hitting streak and doesn t change his jock or socks
or pre game routine for as long as he s on the streak  w  sobriety being the hitting streak and whatnot  he explains  the whole
church basement is literally blue with smoke  gately says he feels like this is a pretty limp and lame understanding of a higher
power  a cheese easement or unwashed athletic supporter  he says but when he tries to go beyond the very basic rote automatic
get me through this day please stuff  when he kneels at other times and prays or meditates or tries to achieve a big picture
spiritual understanding of a god as he can understand him  he feels nothing   not nothing but nothing  an edgeless blankness
that somehow feels worse than the sort of unconsidered atheism he came in with  he says he doesn t know if any of this is coming
through or making any sense or if it s all just still symptomatic of a thoroughgoingly diseased will and quote  spirit   he finds
himself telling the tough shit but you still can t drink audience dark doubtful thoughts he wouldn t have fucking ever dared tell
ferocious francis man to man  he can t even look at f f  in the crocodile s row as he says that at this point the godunderstanding stuff kind of makes him want to puke  from fear  something you can t see or hear or touch or smell  ok  all right 
but something you can t even feel  because that s what he feels when he tries to understand something to really sincerely pray to 
nothingness  he says when he tries to pray he gets this like image in his mind s eye of the brainwaves or whatever of his prayers
going out and out  with nothing to stop them  going  going  radiating out into like space and outliving him and still going and
never hitting anything out there  much less something with an ear  much much less something with an ear that could possibly
give a rat s ass  he s both pissed off and ashamed to be talking about this instead of how just completely good it is to just be
getting through the day without ingesting a substance  but there it is  this is what s going on  he s no closer to carrying out the
suggestion of the  rd step than the day the probie drove him over to his halfway house from peabody holding  the idea of this
whole god thing makes him puke  still  and he is afraid 
and the same fucking thing happens again  the tough chain smoking tsbyscd group all stands and applauds and the men
give two finger whistles  and people come up at the raffle break to pump his big hand and even sometimes try and hug on him 
it seems like every time he forgets himself and publicizes how he s fucking up in sobriety boston aas fall all over themselves
to tell him how good it was to hear him and to for god s sake keep coming  for them if not for himself  whatever the fuck that
means 
the tough shit but you still can t drink group seems to be over     bikers and biker chicks  meaning your standard
leather vests and    cm  boot heels  belt buckles with little spade shaped knives that come out of a slot in the side  tattoos that are
more like murals  serious tits in cotton halters  big beards  harleywear  wooden matches in mouth corners and so forth  after the
our father  as gately and the other white flag speakers are clustered smoking outside the door to the church basement  the sound

 of high cc  hawgs being kick started is enough to rattle your fillings  gately can t even start to guess what it would be like to be a
sober and drug free biker  it s like what would be the point  he imagines these people polishing the hell out of their leather and
like playing a lot of really precise pool 
this one sober biker that can t be much older than gately and is nearly gately s size   though with a really small head and a
tapered jaw that makes him look kind of like a handsome mantis   as they re massed around the door he brings a car length
chopper up alongside gately  says it was good to hear him  shakes his hand in the complex way of niggers and harleyheads  he
introduces his name as robert f   though on the lapel of his leather vest it says bob death  a biker chick s got her arms around
his waist from behind  as is sop  he tells gately it was good to hear somebody new share from the heart about his struggles with
the god component  it s weird to hear a biker use the boston aa word share  much less component or heart 
the other white flaggers have stopped talking and are watching the two men sort of just awkwardly stand there  the biker
embraced from behind and straddling his throbbing hawg  the guy s got on leather spats and a leather vest with no shirt  and
gately notices the guy s got a jailhouse tatt of aa s weird little insignia of a triangle inside a circle on one big shoulder  robert
f  bob death asks gately if by any chance he s heard the one about the fish  glenn k  in his fucking robe overhears  and of course
he s got to put his own oar in  and breaks in and asks them all if they ve heard the one what did the blind man say as he passed by
the quincy market fish stall  and without waiting says he goes  evening  ladies   a couple male white flaggers fall about  and
tamara n  slaps at the back of glenn k  s head s pointy hood  but without real heat  as in like what are you going to do with this
sick fuck 
bob death smiles coolly  south shore bikers are required to be extremely cool in everything they do  and manipulates a
wooden match with his lip and says no  not that fish one  he has to assume a kind of bar shout to clear the noise of his idling
hawg  he leans in more toward gately and shouts that the one he was talking about was  this wise old whiskery fish swims up to
three young fish and goes   morning  boys  how s the water   and swims away  and the three young fish watch him swim away and
look at each other and go   what the fuck is water   and swim away  the young biker leans back and smiles at gately and gives an
affable shrug and blatts away  a halter top s tits mashed against his back 
gately s forehead was wrinkled in emotional pain all the way up rte    home  they were in the back of ferocious francis s
old car  glenn k  was trying to ask what was the difference between a bottle of    year old hennessey and a human female
vagina  crocodile dicky n  up riding shotgun told glenn to try to fucking remember there was ladies present  ferocious francis
kept moving the toothpick around in his mouth and looking at gately in the rearview  gately wanted to both cry and hit
somebody  glenn s cheap pseudo demonic robes had the faint rank oily smell of a dish towel  there was no smoking in the car 
ferocious francis had a little oxygen tank he had to carry around and a little thin pale blue plastic like tube thing that lay under
his nose and was taped there and sent oxygen up his nose  all he d ever say about the tank and the tube is that they were not his
personal will but that he d submitted to advice and now here he was  still sucking air and staying rabidly active 
something they seem to omit to mention in boston aa when you re new and out of your skull with desperation and ready to
eliminate your map and they tell you how it ll all get better and better as you abstain and recover  they somehow omit to mention
that the way it gets better and you get better is through pain  not around pain  or in spite of it  they leave this out  talking instead
about gratitude and release from compulsion  there s serious pain in being sober  though  you find out  after time  then now that
you re clean and don t even much want substances and feeling like you want to both cry and stomp somebody into goo with pain 
these boston aas start in on telling you you re right where you re supposed to be and telling you to remember the pointless pain
of active addiction and telling you that at least this sober pain now has a purpose  at least this pain means you re going
somewhere  they say  instead of the repetitive gerbil wheel of addictive pain 
they neglect to tell you that after the urge to get high magically vanishes and you ve been substanceless for maybe six or
eight months  you ll begin to start to  get in touch  with why it was that you used substances in the first place  you ll start to feel
why it was you got dependent on what was  when you get right down to it  an anesthetic   getting in touch with your feelings  is
another quilted sampler type cliche that ends up masking something ghastly deep and real  it turns out        it starts to turn out
that the vapider the aa cliche  the sharper the canines of the real truth it covers 
near the end of his ennet residency  at like eight months clean and more or less free of any chemical compulsion  going to the
shattuck every a m  and working the steps and getting active and pounding out meetings like a madman  don gately suddenly
started to remember things he would just as soon not have  remembered  actually remembered s probably not the best word  it
was more like he started to almost reexperience things that he d barely even been there to experience  in terms of emotionally  in
the first place  a lot of it was undramatic little shit  but still somehow painful  e g  like when he was maybe eleven  pretending to
watch tv with his mother and pretending to listen to her p m  nightly monologue  a litany of complaint and regret whose
consonants got mushier and mushier  to the extent it s gately s place to diagnose anybody else as an alcoholic  his mom was
pretty definitely an alcoholic  she drank stolichnaya vodka in front of the tv  they weren t cable ready  for reasons of    she
drank little thin glasses with cut up bits of carrot and pepper that she d drop into the vodka  her maiden name was gately  don s
like organic father had been an estonian immigrant  a wrought iron worker  which is like sort of a welder with ambition  he d
broken gately s mother s jaw and left boston when gately was in his mother s stomach  gately had no brothers or sisters  his
mother was subsequently involved with a live in lover  a former navy m p  who used to beat her up on a regular schedule  hitting
her in the vicinities between groin and breast so that nothing showed  a skill he d picked up as a brig guard and shore patrol  at
about      heinekens he used to all of a sudden throw his readers  digest against the wall and get her down and beat her with
measured blows  she d go down on the floor of the apartment and he d hit her in the hidden vicinity  timing the blows between her
arms  little waves   gately remembered she tried to ward off the blows with a fluttered downward motion of her arms and hands 
as if she were beating out flames  gately still hasn t ever quite gotten over to look at her in state care in the long term care
medicaid place  the m p  s tongue was in the corner of his mouth and his little eyed face wore a look of great concentration  as if
he were taking something delicate apart or putting it together  he d be on one knee knelt over her with his look of sober problemsolving  timing his shots  the blows abrupt and darting  her writhing and trying to kind of shoo them away  the darting blows  out
of the psychic blue  very detailed memories of these fights surfaced one afternoon as he was getting ready to mow the ennet
house lawn for pat in may y d a u   when enfield marine p h h  withheld maintenance services in reprisal for late utilities 

 after the little salem decayed beach cottage with herman the ceiling that breathed  the little like tract house by mrs  waite s
tract house in beverly s good dining room chairs had fluted legs and gately had scratched donad and donold in each leg with a
pin  low down  higher up on the legs  the scratches became correctly spelled  it s like a lot of memories of his youth sank without
bubbles when he quit school and then later only in sobriety bubbled back up to where he could get in touch with them  his
mother used to call the m p  a bastuhd and sometimes go oof when he landed one in the vicinity  she drank vodka with vegetables
suspended in it  a habit she d picked up from the missing estonian  whose first name  gately read on a torn and then fuckeduppedly scotch taped paper out of her jewelry box after his mother s cir rhotic hemorrhage  was bulat  the medicaid long term
place was way the fuck out the yirrell beach bridge in point shirley across the water from the airport  the former m p  delivered
cheese and then later worked in a chowder factory and kept weights in the beverly house s garage and drank heineken beer  and
logged each beer he drank carefully in a little spiral notebook he used to monitor his intake of alcohol 
his mom s special couch for tv was nubbly red chintz  and when she shifted from seated upright to lying on her side with her
arm between her head and the little protective doily on the couch s armrest and the glass held tilting on the little space her breasts
left at the cushion s edge  it was a sign she was going under  gately at like ten or eleven used to pretend to listen and watch tv on
the floor but really be dividing his attention between how close his mom was to unconsciousness and how much stolichnaya was
left in the bottle  she would only drink stolichnaya  which she called her comrade in arms and said nothing but the comrade
would do  after she went under for the evening and he d carefully taken the tilted glass out of her hand  don d take the bottle and
mix the first couple vodkas with diet coke and drink a couple of those until it lost its fire  then drink it straight  this was like a
routine  then he d put the near empty bottle back next to her glass with its vegetables darkening in the undrunk vodka  and she d
wake up on the couch in the morning with no idea she hadn t drank the whole thing  gately was careful to always leave her
enough for a wake up swallow  but this gesture of leaving some  gately s now realized  wasn t just filial kindness on his part  if
she didn t have the wake up swallow she wouldn t get off the red couch all day  and then there would be no new bottle that night 
this was at age ten or eleven  as he now recalls  most of the furniture was wrapped in plastic  the carpet was burnt orange
shag that the landlord kept saying he was going to take up and go to wood floors  the m p  worked nights or else most nights
went out  and then she d take the plastic off the couch 
why the couch had little protective doilies on the arms when it usually had a plastic cover on it gately cannot recall or
explain 
for a while in beverly they had nimitz the kitty 
this all came burpling greasily up into memory in the space of two or three weeks in may  and now more stuff steadily like
dribbles up  for gately to touch 
sober  she d called him bimmy or bim because that s what she heard his little friends call him  she didn t know the
neighborhood cognomen came from an acronym for  big indestructible moron   his head had been huge  as a child  out of all
proportion  though with nothing especially estonian about it  that he could see  he d been very sensitive about it  the head  but
never told her not to call him bim  when she was drunk and conscious she called him her doshka or dochka or like that 
sometimes  well in the bag himself  when he turned off the uncabled set and covered her with the af ghan  easing the mostly
empty stoly bottle back onto the little tv guide table by the bowl of darkening chopped peppers  his unconscious mom would
groan and titter and call him her doshka and good sir knight and last and only love  and ask him not to hit her anymore 
in june he got in touch with memories that their front steps in beverly were a pocked cement painted red even in the pocks 
their mailbox was part of a whole tract housing complex s honeycomb of mailboxes on a like small pole  brushed steel and gray
with a postal eagle on it  you needed a little key to get your mail out  and for a long time he thought the sign on it said  us mail  
as in us instead of u s  his mom s hair had been dry blond white with dark roots that never lengthened or went away  no one tells
you when they tell you you have cirrhosis that eventually you ll all of a sudden start choking on your own blood  this is called a
cirrhotic hemorrhage  your liver won t process any more of your blood and it quote shunts the blood and it goes up your throat in
a high pressure jet  is what they told him  is why he d first thought the m p  d come back and cut his mom or stabbed her  when he
first came in  after football  his last season  at age seventeen  she d been diagnosed for years  she d go to meetings       for a
few weeks  then drink on the couch  silent  telling him if the phone rang she wasn t home  after a few weeks of this she d spend a
whole day weeping  beating at herself as if on fire  then she d go back to meetings for a while  eventually her face began to swell
and make her eyes piggy and her big breasts pointed at the floor and she turned the deep yellow of quality squash  this was all
part of the diagnosis  at first gately just couldn t go out to the long term place  couldn t see her out there  couldn t deal  then
after some time passed he couldn t go because he couldn t face her and try and explain why he hadn t come before now  ten plus
years have gone like that  gately hadn t probably consciously thought of her once for three years  before getting straight 
right after their neighbor mrs  waite got found by the meter guy dead  so he must have been nine  when his mom was first
diagnosed  gately had gotten the diagnosis mixed up in his head with king arthur  he d ride a mop handle horse and brandish a
trashcan lid and a batteryless plastic light saber and tell the neighborhood kids he was sir osis of thuliver  most fearsomely
loyal and fierce of arthur s vessels  since the summer now  when he mops shattuck shelter floors  he hears the clopaclopaclop he
used to make with his big square tongue as sir osis  then  riding 
and his dreams late that night  after the braintree bob death commitment  seem to set him under a sort of sea  at terrific
depths  the water all around him silent and dim and the same temperature he is 
very late october y d a u 
hal incandenza had this horrible new recurring dream where he was losing his teeth  where his teeth had become like shale
and splintered when he tried to chew  and fragmented and melted into grit in his mouth  in the dream he was going around
squeezing a ball and spitting fragments and grit  getting more and more hungry and scared  everything in there loosened by a
great oral rot that the nightmare s teddy schacht wouldn t even look at  saying he was late for his next appointment  everyone hal
saw seeing hal s crumbling teeth and looking at their watch and making vague excuses  a general atmosphere of the splintering
teeth being a symptom of something way more dire and distasteful that no one wanted to confront him about  he was pricing
dentures when he woke  it was about an hour before dawn drills  his keys were on the floor by the bed with his college board
prep books  mario s great iron bed was empty and made up tight  all five pillows neatly stacked  mario d been spending the last

 few nights over at hmh  sleeping on an air mattress in the living room in front of tavis s tatsuoka receiver  listening to wyyy    into the wee hours  weirdly agitated about madame psychosis s unannounced sabbatical from the     minutes      midnight
thing where she d been an unvarying m f presence for several years  it seemed like  wyyy had been evasive and unforthcoming
about the whole thing  for two days some alto grad student had tried to fill in  billing herself as miss diagnosis  reading
horkheimer and adorno against a background of partridge family slowed down to a narcotized slur  at no time had anyone of
managerial pitch or timbre mentioned madame psychosis or what her story was or her date of expected return  hal d told mario
that the silence was a positive sign  that if she d left the air for good the station would have had to say something  hal  coach
schtitt  and the moms had all remarked mario s odd mood  mario was usually next to impossible to agitate       
now wyyy was back to running  sixty minutes more or less  without anybody at all at the helm  for the past several nights
mario has lain there in a sarcophagally tapered sleeping bag of goretex and fiberfill and listened to them run the weird static
ambient musics madame psychosis uses for background  but now without any spoken voice as foreground  and the static 
momentumless music as subject instead of environment is somehow terribly disturbing  hal listened to a few minutes of the stuff
and told his brother it sounded like somebody s mind coming apart right before your ears 

  november year of the depend adult undergarment
the enfield tennis academy has an accredited capacity of     junior players   of whom    are to be male   but an actual
fall y d a u  population of    paying and    scholarship students  so      of which    are female  right now  for some reason 
meaning that while there s room for twelve more  preferably full tuition  junior players  there ought ideally to be fully sixteen
more males than there are  meaning charles tavis and co  are wanting to fill all twelve available spots with males   plus they
wouldn t exactly mind  is the general scuttlebutt  if a half dozen or so of the better girls left before graduation and tried for the
show  simply because housing more than    girls means putting some in the male dorms  which creates tensions and licensingand conservative parent problems  given that coed hall bathrooms are not a good idea what with all the adolescent glands firing all
over the place 
it also means that  since there are twice as many male prorectors as female  a m  drills have to be complexly staggered  the
boys in two sets of     the girls in three of     which creates problems in terms of early p m  classes for the lowest ranked csquad girls  who drill last 
matriculations  gender quotas  recruiting  financial aid  room assignments  mealtimes  rankings  class v  drill schedules 
prorector hiring  accommodating changes in drill schedule consequent to a player s movement up or down a squad  it s all the sort
of thing that s uninteresting unless you re the one responsible  in which case it s cholesterol raisingly stressful and complex  the
stress of all the complexities and priorities to be triaged and then weighted against one another gets charles tavis out of bed in the
headmaster s house at an ungodly hour most mornings  his sleep swollen face twitching with permutations  he stands in leather
slippers at the living room window  looking southeast past west and center courts at the array of a team players assembling
stiffly in the gray glow  carrying gear with their heads down and some still asleep on their feet  the first bit of snout of the sun
protruding through the city s little skyline far beyond them  the aluminum glints of river and sea  east  tavis s hands working
nervously around the cup of hazlenut decaf that steams upward into his face as he holds it  hair unarranged and one side hanging 
high forehead up against the window s glass so he can feel the mean chill of the dawn just outside  his lips moving slightly and
without sound  the thing it s not entirely impossible he may have fathered asleep up next to the sound system with its claws on its
chest and four pillows for bradypnea afflicted breathing that sounds like soft repetitions of the words sky or ski  making no
unnecessary sound  not eager to wake it and have to interface with it and have it look up at him with a terrible calm and accepting
knowledge it s quite possible is nothing but tavis s imagination  so lips moving w o sound but breath and cup s steam spreading on
the glass  and little icicles from the rainy melt of yesterday s snow hanging from the anodized gutters just above the window and
seen by tavis as a distant skyline upside down  in the lightening sky the same two or three clouds seem to move back and forth
like sentries  the heat comes on with a distant whoom and the glass against his forehead trembles slightly  a hiss of low static
from the speaker it had fallen into sleep without turning off  the a team s array keeps shifting and melding as they await schtitt 
permutations of complications 
tavis watches the boys stretch and confer and sips from the cup with both hands  the concerns of the day assembling
themselves in a sort of tree diagram of worry  charles tavis knows what james incandenza could not have cared about less  the
key to the successful administration of a top level junior tennis academy lies in cultivating a kind of reverse buddhism  a state of
total worry 
so the best e t a  players  special perk is they get hauled out of bed at dawn  still crusty eyed and pale with sleep  to drill in
the first shift 
dawn drills are of course alfresco until they erect and inflate the lung  which hal incandenza hopes is soon  his circulation is
poor because of tobacco and or marijuana  and even with his dunlop down both legs sweatpants and a turtleneck and thick old
white alpaca tennis jacket that had been his father s and has to be rolled up at the sleeves  he s sullen and chilled  hal is  and by the
time they ve run the pre stretch sprints up and down the e t a  hill four times  swinging their sticks madly in all directions and  at
a  delint s dictate  making various half hearted warrior noises  hal is both chilled and wet  and his sneakers squelch from dew as
he hops in place and looks at his breath  wincing as the cold air hits the one bad tooth 
by the time they re all stretching out  lined up in rows along the service and baselines  flexing and bowing  genuflecting to
nothing  changing postures at the sound of a whistle  by this time the sky has lightened to the color of kaopectate  the
athscme fans are idle and the e t a s can hear birds  smoke from the stacks of the sunstrand complex is weakly sunlit as it
hangs in plumes  completely still  as if painted on the air  tiny cries and a repetitive scream for help come up from someplace
downhill to the east  presumably enfield marine  this is the one time of day the charles doesn t look bright blue  the pines  birds
don t sound any happier than the players  the grounds  non pines are bare and canted at circuitous hillside angles all up and down
the hill when they sprint again  four more times  then on bad days another four  maybe the most hated part of the day s
conditioning  somebody always throws up a little  it s like the drills  reveille  the river at dawn is a strip of foil s dull side  kyle

 coyle keeps saying it s co wo wold  all the lesser players are still abed  today there s multiple retching  from last night s sweets 
hal s breath hangs before his face until he moves through it  sprints produce the sick sound of much squelching  everyone wishes
the hill s grass would die 
twenty four girls are drilled in groups of six on four of the center courts  the    boys  minus  rather ominously  j  j  penn 
are split by rough age into fours and take a semi staggered eight of the east courts  schtitt is up in his little observational crow s
nest  a sort of apse at the end of the iron transom players call the tower that extends west to east over the centers of all three sets
of courts and terminates w  the nest high above the show courts  he has a chair and an ashtray up there  sometimes from the
courts you can see him leaning over the railing  tapping the edge of the bullhorn with his weatherman s pointer  from the west and
center courts the rising sun behind him gives his white head a pinkish corona  when he s seated you just see misshapen smokerings coming up out of the nest and moving off with the wind  the sound of the bullhorn is scarier when you can t see him  the
waffled iron stairs leading up to the transom are west of the west courts  all the way across from the nest  so sometimes schtitt
paces back and forth along the transom with his pointer behind his back  his boots ringing out on the iron  schtitt seems immune
to all weather and always dresses the same for drills  the warm ups and boots  when the e t a s  strokes or play s being filmed for
study  mario incandenza is positioned on the railing of schtitt s nest  leaning way out and filming down  his police lock protruding
into empty air  with somebody beefy assigned to stand behind him and grip the back of the velcro vest  it always scares hell out of
hal because you can never see dunkel or nwangi behind mario and it always looks like he s leaning way out to dive bolex first
down onto court   s net 
except during periods of disciplinary conditioning  alfresco a m  drills work like this  a prorector is at each relevant court
with two yellow ball hopper brand baskets of used balls  plus a ball machine  which machine looks like an open footlocker with a
blunt muzzle at one end pointed across the net at a quartet of boys and connected by long orange industrial cords to a three prong
outdoor outlet at the base of each light pole  some of the light poles cast long thin shadows across the courts as soon as the sun is
strong enough for there to be shadows  in summertime players try to sort of huddle in the thin lines of shade  ortho stice keeps
yawning and shivering  john wayne wears a small cold smile  hal hops up and down in his capacious jacket and plum turtleneck
and looks at his breath and tries a la lyle to focus very intently on the pain of his tooth without judging it as bad or good  k  d 
coyle  out of the infirmary after the weekend  opines that he doesn t see why the better players  reward for hard slogging to the
upper rungs is dawn drills while for instance pemulis and the vikemeister et al  are still horizontal and sawing logs  coyle says
this every morning  stice tells him he s surprised at how little they ve missed him  coyle is from the small tucson az suburb of
erythema and claims to have thin desert blood and special sensitivity to the wet chill of boston s dawn  the whataburger jr 
invitational is a sort of double edged thanksgiving homecoming for coyle  who at thirteen was lured from tucson s own rancho
vista golf and tennis academy by promises of self transcendence from schtitt 
drills work like this  eight different emphases on eight different courts  each quartet starts at a different court and rotates
around  the top four traditionally start drills on the first court  backhands down the line  two boys to a side  corbett thorp lays
down squares of electrician s tape at the court s corners and they are strongly encouraged to hit the balls into the little squares  hal
hits with stice  coyle with wayne  axford s been sent down with shaw and struck for some reason  second court  forehands 
same deal  stice consistently misses the square and gets a low ph rejoinder from tex watson  hatless and pattern balding at
twenty seven  hal s tooth hurts and his ankle is stiff and the cold balls come off his strings with a dead sound like chung  tiny
bratwursts of smoke ascend rhythmically from schtitt s little nest  third court is  butterflies   a complex vaps deal where hal hits
a backhand down the line to stice while coyle forehands it to wayne and then wayne and stice cross court the balls back to hal
and coyle  who have to switch sides without bashing into each other and hit back down the line now to wayne and stice 
respectively  wayne and hal amuse themselves by making their cross court balls collide on every fifth exchange or so   this is
known around e t a  as  atom smashing  and is understandably hard to do   and the collided balls sprong wildly out onto the
other practice courts  and rik dunkel is less amused than wayne and hal are  so  nicely warm now and arms singing  they re
shunted quickly onto the fourth court  volleys for depth  then for angle  then lobs and overheads  which latter drill can be
converted into a disciplinary puker if a pro rector s feeding you the lobs  the overhead drill s called tap   whack   hal pedals
back  terribly ankle conscious  jumps  kicks out  nails slice s lob  then has to sprint up and tap the net s tape with his dunlop s
head as stice lobs deep again  and hal has to backpedal again and jump and kick and hit it  and so on  then hal and coyle  both
sucking wind after twenty and trying to stand up straight  feed lobs to wayne and stice  neither of whom is fatiguable as far as
anyone can tell  you have to kick out on overheads to keep your balance in the air  overhead  schtitt uses an unamplified bullhorn
and careful enunciation to call out for everyone to hear that mr  revenant hal incandenza was letting the ball get the little much
behind him on overheads  fears of the ankle maybe  hal raises his stick in acknowledgment without looking up  to hang in past
age fourteen here is to become immune to humiliation from staff  coyle tells hal between the lobs they send up he d love to see
schtitt have to do twenty tap   whacks in a row  they re all flushed to a shine  all chill washed off  noses running freely and
heads squeaking with blood  the sun well above the sea s dull glint and starting to melt the frozen slush from i  day s snow and
rain that night custodians had swept into little wedged lines up against the lengthwise fences  which grimy wedges are now
starting to melt and run  there s still no movement in the sunstrand stacks  plumes  the watching prorectors stand easy with their
legs apart and their arms crossed over their racquets  faces  the same three or four booger shaped clouds seem to pass back and
forth overhead  and when they cover the sun people s breath reappears  stice blows on his racquet hand and cries out thinly for the
inflation of the lung  mr  a  f  delint ranges behind the fence with his clipboard and whistle  blowing his nose  the girls behind
him are too bundled up to be worth watching  their hair rubber banded into little bouncing tails 
fifth court  serves to both corners of both boxes  catching each others  serves and serving them back  first serves  second
serves  slice serves  shank serves  and back snapping american twist serves that stice begs off of  telling the prorector   neil
hartigan  who s   m  tall and of so few words everybody fears him by default   he s having lower spasms from a mispositioned
bed  then coyle   he of the weak bladder and suspicious discharge   gets excused to go back into the eastern tree line out of
sight of the distaffs and pee  so the other three get a minute to jog over to the pavilion and stand with their hands on their hips and
breathe and drink gator ade out of little conic paper cups you can t put down til they re empty  the way you flush out a cottony
mouth between drills is you take a mouthful of gatorade and puff out your cheeks to make a globe of liquid that you mangle with

 your teeth and tongue  then lean out and spit out into the grass and take another drink for real  the sixth court is returns of serve
down the line  down the center  cross court for depth  then for placement  then for deep placement  w  more taped squares  then
chipped center  and cross returns against a server who follows his serve to the net  the server practices half volleys off the chips 
although wayne and stice are so fast that they re on top of the net by the time the return gets to them and they can volley it away
at chest height  wayne drills with the casual economy of somebody who s in about second gear  the urns  dispensers  cups can t
stand up  their bottoms are pointy and they ll spill any liquid still in them  is why you have to empty them  between squads
harde s guys will sweep the pavilion of dozens of cones 
then  blessedly  on the seventh court  physically undemanding finesse drills  drops  drops for angles  topspin lobs  extreme
angles  drops for extreme angles  then restful microtennis  tennis inside the service lines  very soft and precise  radical angles
much encouraged  touch  and artistry wise nobody comes close to hal in microtennis  by this time hal s turtleneck is soaked
through under the alpaca jacket  and exchanging it for a sweatshirt out of the gear bag is a kind of renewal  what wind there is
down here is out of the south  the temperature is now probably in the low    s c   the sun s been up an hour  and you can almost
see the light pole and transom shadows rotating slowly northwest  the sunstrand stacks  plumes stand there cigarette straight  not
even seeming to spread at the top  the sky is going a glassy blue 
no  tennis  balls required on the final court  wind sprints  probably the less said about wind sprints the better  then more
gatorade  which hal and coyle are breathing too hard to enjoy  as schtitt comes slowly down from the transom  it takes a while 
you can hear his steel toed boots hit each iron step  there is something creepy about a very fit older man  to say nothing of
jackboots w  fila warm ups of claret colored silk  he s coming this way  both hands behind his back and the pointer poking out to
the side  schtitt s crew cut and face are nacreous as he moves east in the yellowing a m  light  this is sort of the signal for all the
quartets to gather at the show courts  behind them the girls are still hitting groundstrokes in baroque combinations  much highpitched grunting and the lifeless chung of cold hit balls  three    s are made to squeegee the more extrusive melt back into the
little banks of frozen leaves along the fence  at the horizon to the north a bulbous cone of picric clouds that gets taller by the hour
as the methuen andover border s mammoth effectuators force northern ma s combined oxides north against some sort of upperair resistance  it looks like  you can see little bits of glitter from broken monitor glass in the frozen stuff up by the fences behind
     and one or two curved shards of floppy disk  and they re a troubling sight  penn being absent amid troubling leg rumors 
postal weight with two black eyes and his nose covered with horizontal bandages that are starting to loosen and curl at the edges
from sweat  and otis p  lord alleged to have come back from the emergency room at st  elizabeth s last night with the hitachi
monitor over his head  still  its removal  with all the sharp teeth of the broken screen s glass pointing at key parts of lord s throat 
apparently calling for the sort of esoteric expertise you have to fly in by private medical jet  according to axford 
they all get on the outside of three cones of gatorade  bent or squatting  sucking wind  while schtitt stands at a sort of parade
rest with his weatherman s pointer behind his back and shares overall impressions with the players on the morning s work thus
far  certain players are singled out for special mention or humiliation  then more wind sprints  then a brief like strategy clinicthing from corbett thorp on how approach shots down the line aren t always the very best tactic  and why  thorp s a first rate
tennis mind  but his terrible stutter makes the boys so uncomfortable they have a hard time listening       
the whole first shift s on the eighth court for the final conditioning drills        first are star drills  a dozen plus boys on
either side of the net  behind the baselines  form a line  go one at a time  go  run up the side line  touch the net with your stick 
then backwards to the outside corner of the service box and then forward to touch the net again  backward to the middle of the
service box  forward to touch net  back to the baseline s little jut of centerline  up to net  service box s other outside corner  net 
baseline s corner  net  then turn and run like hell for the corner you started from  schtitt has a stopwatch  there s a janitorial
bucket       placed in the doubles alley by the finish point  for potential distress  they each do the star drill three times  hal
has    seconds and    and     which is average both for him and for any seventeen year old with a resting pulse rate in the high
  s  john wayne s low of    occurs on his third star  and he stops dead at the finish point and always just stands there  never
bending or walking it off  stice gets a    and everyone gets very excited until schtitt says he was slow starting the watch  the
arthritis in a thumb  everyone but wayne and stice uses the retch bucket in a sort of pro forma way  sixteen year old petropolis
kahn  a k a   w m   for  woolly mammoth  because he s so hairy  gets a    and then a    and then pitches forward onto the hard
surface and lies very still  tony nwangi tells people to walk around him 
the cardiovascular finale is side to sides  conceived by van der meer in the b s     s and demonic in its simplicity  again
split into fours on eight courts  for the top    s  prorector r  dunkel at net with an armful of balls and more in a hopper beside
him  hitting fungoes  one to the forehand corner and then one to the backhand corner and then farther out to the forehand corner
and so on  and on  hal incandenza is expected at least to get a racquet on each ball  for stice and wayne the expectations are
higher  a very unpleasant drill fatigue wise  and for hal also ankle wise  what with all the stopping and reversing  hal wears two
bandages over a left ankle he shaves way more often than his upper lip  over the bandages goes an air stirrup inflatable ankle
brace that s very lightweight but looks a bit like a medieval torture implement  it was in a stop and reverse move much like sideto sides       that hal tore all the soft left ankle tissue he then owned  at fifteen  in his ankle  at atlanta s easter bowl  in the
third round  which he was losing anyway  dunkel goes fairly easy on hal  at least on the first two go arounds  because of the
ankle  hal s going to be seeded in at least the top   at the whataburger inv  in a couple weeks  and woe to the prorector who lets
hal get hurt the way hal let some of his little buddies get hurt yesterday 
what s potentially demonic about side to sides is that the duration of the drill and pace and angle of the fungoes to be chased
down from side to side are entirely at the prorector s discretion  prorector rik dunkel  a former    s doubles runner up at jr 
wimbledon and a decent enough guy  the son of some kind of plastic packaging systems tycoon on the south shore  tied with
thorp for brightest of the prorectors  more or less by default   regarded as kind of a mystic because he refers people sometimes to
lyle and has been observed sitting at community gatherings with his eyes closed but not sleeping      but the point is a decent
enough guy but not much into any kind of exchange of quarter  he seems to have received instructions to put the particular hurt on
ortho stice this time  and by his third go around stice is trying to weep without breath and mewing for his aunts        but
anyway everybody goes through sides to sides three times  even petropolis kahn staggers through them  who after stars had had
to be sort of lugged over by stephan wagenknecht and jeff wax with his nikes dragging behind him and his head swinging free

 on his neck and given kind of a swingset shove to get started  hal feels for kahn  who s not fat but is in the schacht type mold 
very thick and solid  except also carrying extra weight in terms of leg and back hair  and who always tires easily no matter how
hard he conditions  kahn makes it through but stays bent over the distress bucket long after the third go around  staring into it 
and stays that way while everybody else removes more soaked bottom layers of clothing and accepts clean towels from a halfwayhouse part time black girl with a towel cart  and picks up balls       
it is o  oh  and they are through with the active part of dawn drills  nwangi  at the edge of the hillside  is whistling the next
shift over for opening sprints  schtitt shares more overall impressions as minimum wage aides dispense kleenex and paper cones 
nwangi s reedy voice carries  he s telling the b s he wishes to see nothing but assholes and elbows on these sprints  it s unclear to
hal what this might connote  the a players have formed those ragged rows behind the baseline again  and schtitt paces back and
forth 
 am seeing sluggish drilling  by sluggards  not meaning insults  this is the fact  motions are gone through  barely minimal
efforts  cold  yes  the cold hands and nose with mucus  thoughts on getting through  going in  hot showers  water very hot  a
meal  the thoughts are drifting toward the comfort of ending  too cold to demand the total  yes  master chu  too cold for tennis
at the high level  yes  
chu   it does seem pretty cold out  sir  
 ah   pacing back and forth with about faces at every tenth step  stopwatch around his neck  pipe and pouch and pointer in his
hands behind his back  nodding to himself  clearly wishing he had a third hand so he could stroke his white chin  pretending to
ruminate  every a m  essentially the same  except when schtitt does the females and the males get dressed down by delint  all
the older boys  eyes are glazed with repetition  hal s tooth gives off little electric shivers with each inbreath  and he feels slightly
unwell  when he moves his head slightly the monitor glass bits  glitter shifts and dances along the opposite fence in a sort of
sickening way 
 ah   turns crisply toward them  looking briefly skyward   and when is hot  too pretty hot for the total self on the court  the
other hand of the spectrum  ach  is always something that is too  master incandenza who cannot quickly get behind lob s descent
so weight can move forvart into overhand        please tell your thinking  it is always hot or cold  yes  
a small smile   s been our general observation out there  sir  
 so then then so  master chu  from california s temperance regions  
chu brings down his hankie   i guess we have to learn to adjust to conditions  sir  i believe is what you re saying  
a full sharp half turn to face the group   is what i am not saying  young lamont chu  is why you cease to seem to give total
effort of self since you begin with the clipping pictures of great professional figures for your adhesive tape and walls  no 
because  privileged gentlemen and boys i am saying  is always something that is too  cold  hot  wet and dry  very bright sun and
you see the purple dots  very bright hot and you have no salt  outside is wind  the insects which like the sweat  inside is smell of
heaters  echo  being jammed in together  tarp is overdose to baseline  not enough of room  bells inside clubs which ring the hour
loudly to distract  clunk of machines vomiting sweet cola for coins  inside roof too low for the lob  bad lighting  so  or outside 
the bad surface  oh no look no  crabgrass in cracks along baseline  who could give the total  with crabgrass  look here is low net
high net  opponent s relatives heckle  opponent cheats  linesman in semifinal is impaired or cheats  you hurt  you have the injury 
bad knee and back  hurt groin area from not stretching as asked  aches of elbow  eyelash in eye  the throat is sore  a too pretty
girl in audience  watching  who could play like this  big crowd overwhelming or too small to inspire  always something  
his turns as he paces are crisp and used to punctuate   adjust  adjust  stay the same  no  is not stay the same  it is cold  it is
wind  cold and wind is the world  outside  yes  on the tennis court the you the player  this is not where there is cold wind  i am
saying  different world mside  world built inside cold outside world of wind breaks the wind  shelters the player  you  if you stay
the same  stay inside   pacing gradually faster  the turns becoming pirouettic  the older kids stare straight ahead  some of the
younger follow every move of the pointer with wide eyes  trevor axford is bent at the waist and moving his head slightly  trying
to get the sweat dripping off his face to spell something out on the surface  schtitt is silent for two fast about faces  ranging before
them  tapping his jaw with the pointer   not ever i think this adjusting  to what  this adjusting  this world inside is the same 
always  if you stay there  this is what we are making  no  new type citizen  not of cold and wind outside  citizens of this
sheltering second world we are working to show you every dawn  no  to make your introduction   the big buddies translate
schtitt into accessible language for the littler kids  is a big part of their assignment 
 borders of court for singles mr  rader are what  
 twenty four by eight sir   sounding hoarse and thin 
 so  second world without cold or purple dots of bright for you is      meters    i think    meters  yes  in that world is joy
because there is shelter of something else  of purpose past sluggardly self and complaints about uncomfort  i am speaking to not
just lamont chu of the temperance world  you have a chance to occur  playing  no  to make for you this second world that is
always the same  there is in this world you  and in the hand a tool  there is a ball  there is opponent with his tool  and always only
two of you  you and this other  inside the lines  with always a purpose to keep this world alive  yes   the pointer motions through
all this become too orchestral and intricate to describe   this second world inside the lines  yes  is this adjusting  this is not
adjusting  this is not adjusting to ignore cold and wind and tired  not ignoring  as if   is no cold  is no wind  no cold wind where
you occur  no  not  adjust to conditions   make this second world inside the world  here there are no conditions  
looks around 
 so put a lid on it about the fucking cold   says delint  with his clipboard under his arm and his strangler sized hands in his
pockets  hopping a little in place 
schtitt is looking around  like most germans outside popular entertainment  he gets quieter when he wants to impress or
menace   there are very few shrill germans  actually    if it is hard   he says softly  hard to hear because of the rising wind 
 difficult  for you to move between the two worlds  from cold hot wind and sun to this inside place inside the lines where is always
the same   he says  seeming now to study the weatherman s pointer he holds down and out with both hands   it can be arranged for
you gentlemen not to leave  ever here  this world inside the lines of court  you know  can stay here until there is citizenship 
right here   the pointer is pointed at the spots they re standing at breathing and blotting their faces and blowing their noses   can

 today put up testar lung  for world s shelter  sleep bags  meals brought to you  never across the lines  never leave the court 
study here  a bucket for hygienic needs  at gymnasium kaiserslautern where i am privileged boy who whining about cold wind 
we live inside tennis court for months  to learn to live inside  very lucky days when they bring us meals  not possible to cross a
line for months of living  
left hander brian van vleck picks a bad moment to break wind 
schtitt shrugs  half turning away from them to look off somewhere   or else leave here into large external world where is cold
and pain without purpose or tool  eyelash in eye and pretty girl   not worry anymore about how to occur   looks around   no one
is a prisoner here  who would like to escape into large world  master sweeny

 mr  peter beak with always the weeping to home on the telephone  
the twelve year old says not me sir several times 
hal very subtly shoots in a small plug of kodiak  aubrey delint has his arms crossed over the clipboard and is looking
around beadily like a crow  hal incandenza has an almost obsessive dislike for delint  whom he tells mario he sometimes cannot
quite believe is even real  and tries to get to the side of  to see whether delint has a true z coordinate or is just a cutout or
projection  the kids of the next shift are walking downhill and sprinting back up and walking down  warrior whooping without
conviction  the other male prorectors are drinking cones of gatorade  clustered in the little pavilion  feet up on patio chairs

the heterosexual male residents pray daily will be the leggy alumna and part time counselor danielle steen bok  who s rumored
also to attend sex and love addicts anonymous  which engages everyone s imagination to the max 
it s a mark of serious regard and questionable judgment that director pat m  lets don gately drive her priceless aventura 
even just to like the metro food bank or purity supreme  because gately lost his license more or less permanently back in the
year of the whisper quiet maytag dishmaster for getting pinched on a dui in peabody on a license that had already been
suspended for a previous dui in lowell  this was not the only loss don gately incurred as his chemical careers moved toward
their life reversing climax  once every couple months now  still  he has to put on his brown dress slacks and slightly irregular
green sportcoat from brighton budget large  n tall menswear and take the commuter rail up to selected district court venues on
the north shore and meet with his various p d s and p o s and caseworkers and sometimes appear briefly up in front of judges
and review boards to review the progress of his sobriety and reparations  when he first came to ennet house last year  gately
had bad check and forgery issues  he had a malicious destruction of property issue  plus two d ds and a bullshit public
urination out of tewksbury  he had a break and enter from a silent alarmed peabody mansion where he and a colleague got
pinched before anything could get promoted  he had a possession with intent from       mg  tablets of demerol       in a pez
container which he d shoved down into the crack of the peabody finest s cruiser s back seat  but which got found anyway on the
routine post transport cruiser search all cops perform when the arrestee s pupils are unresponsive both to light and to head slaps 
there was  too  of course  a certain darker issue  vis a vis a certain upscale brookline home whose late owner had been

 eulogized at terrifying length and headline size in both the globe and herald  after eight months of indescribable psychic
cringing  waiting for the legal footwear to drop on the nuck vip issue   toward the end of his drug use gately d gotten sloppy
and crazy and stuck idiotically with a method of straight meter shunting that he d learned up at mci billerica and was pretty sure
now constituted a signature gately m o   since the older guy that d taught it to him in the billerica metal shop had subsequently
got out and gone to utah and died of a morphine overdose  and like who on earth hopes to get reliable morphine in fucking utah  
over two years ago   after eight months of cringing and nail biting  the last couple months of the torment in ennet house   even
though the house s d s a s  license put it legally off limits to all constabulary without pat montesian s physical presence and
notarized permission   after he was down to the cuticles on all ten digits  gately had very discreetly approached a certain
percodan devoted court stenographer an old girlfriend had once dealt to  and had the guy make equally discreet inquiries  and
found that the potential murder   investigation of the botched burglary       had been taken over   pace the loud howls of a
certain remorseless revere a d a    by something federal the addled stenographer called  non specific services bureau  
whereupon the case vanished from any sort of investigative scene the stenographer could make inquiries about  though quiet
rumor had it that current suspicions were being directed at certain shadowy nucko political bodies all the way up in quebec  far
north of the enfield ma where gately had been cringing his way to nightly aa meetings with his fingers in his mouth 
most of the cases gately had had pending his p d  had gotten closed without finding        contingent on gately s entering
long term treatment and maintaining chemical abstinence and submitting to random urinalyses and making biweekly reparation
payments out of the pathetic paychecks he earned cleaning shit and sperm under stavros lobokulas and now also cooking and
live in staffing at ennet house  the only issue not resolved on a blue file deferral was the business of driving with a duisuspended license  in the commonwealth of ma  this issue carries a mandatory    day bit  as in like the penalty s written right
into the statute  and the case s p d  has been up front with gately about it s only a matter of the time of the wheels  slow judicial
grind before some judge red files the issue and the case and gately has to do the bit at someplace mci minimum like concord
or deer island  gately isn t too hinked about    inside  at twenty four he d done    months at billerica for assaulting two
bouncers in a nightclub   it was more like he d beaten the second bouncer bloody with the unconscious body of the first   and
he knew quite well he could get by in a commonwealth lockdown  he was too big to fuck or fuck with and not interested in
fucking with anyone else  he did his time stand up and gave nobody any provoking cause  and when the first couple hard guys had
come after him for his canteen cigarettes he d laughed it off with ferocious jolliness  and when they came back a second time
gately beat them half to death in the corridor behind the weight room where he could be sure plenty of other guys could hear it 
and after that one incident was out of the way he could simply get by and not get fucked with  gately now was hinked only about
the prospect of getting just one or two aa meetings a week in jail   the only meetings sober inmates get are when an area group
comes in on an institutional commitment  which gately s been on   when demerol and talwin and good old weed are almost
easier to get in jail than in the outside world  gately cringed now only at the thought of the sergeant at arms  the distinguishedlooking shepherd guy  going back to ingesting substances had become his biggest fear  even gately can tell this is a major
psychic turn around  he tells the newer residents right up front that aa s somehow gotten him by the mental curlies  he ll now go
to literally any lengths to stay clean 
he ll tell them right out that he d first come to ennet house only to keep out of jail  and hadn t had much interest or hope
about actually staying clean for any length of time  and he d been up front with pat montesian about this during his application
interview  the grim honesty about his disinterest and hopelessness was one reason pat even let such a clearly bad news specimen
into the house on nothing but a lukewarm referral from a p o  up at the  th district office in peabody  pat told gately that grim
honesty and hopelessness were the only things you need to start recovering from substance addiction  but that without these
qualities you were totally up the creek  desperation helped also  she said  gately scratched at her dog s stomach and said he wasn t
sure if he was desperate about anything except wanting to somehow stop getting in trouble for things he usually afterward couldn t
even remember he did them  the dog trembled and shuddered and its eyes rolled up as gately  who hadn t been told about pat s
thing about wanting her dogs petted  rubbed its scabby stomach  pat had said like well that was enough  that desire for the
shitstorm to end        gately said her dog sure did like having its stomach rubbed  and pat explained that the dog was epileptic 
and said that just a desire to stop blacking out was more than enough to start with  she pulled some commonwealth substanceabuse study in a black plastic binder off a long black plastic bookshelf filled with black plastic binders  it turned out pat
montesian liked the color black a lot  she was dressed   really kind of overdressed  for a halfway house   in black leather pants
and a black shirt of silk or something silky  outside the bay window a green line train was laboring up the first enfield hill in the
late summer rain  the downhill view from the bay window over pat s black lacquer or enamelish desk was like the only
spectacular thing about ennet house  which was otherwise a wicked awful dump  pat made a sound against the binder with a
svelte nail extension and said that in this state study right here  conducted in the year of the tucks medicated pad  over     of
the inmates serving life sentences in hellish mci walpole and not disputing that they d done what they d done to get in there
nevertheless had no memory of having done it  whatever got them in there  for life  none  gately had to have her run it by him a
couple times before he isolated her point  they d been in blackouts  pat said a blackout was where you continued to function  
sometimes disastrously   but weren t aware later of what you did  it s like your mind wasn t in possession of your body  and it
was usually brought on by alcohol but could also be brought on by chronic use of other substances  synthetic narcotics among
them  gately said he couldn t recall ever having a real blackout  and pat m  got it but didn t laugh  the dog was heaving and
quivering with its legs spronged out to all points of the compass and kind of spasming  and gately didn t know whether to quit
rubbing on it  to be honest he didn t know what epilepsy was but suspected pat was not referring to the woman s leg shaver thing
his totally alcoholic past girlfriend pamela hoffman jeep used to scream in the bathroom when she used  everything mental for
gately was kind of befogged and prone to misprision for well into his first year clean 
pat montesian was both pretty and not  she was in maybe her late thirties  she d supposedly been this young and pretty and
wealthy socialite out on the cape until her husband had divorced her for being a nearly fullblown alcoholic  which seemed like
abandonment and didn t improve her subsequent drinking one jot  she d been in and out of rehabs and halfway places in her
twenties  but then it wasn t until she d almost died from a stroke during the d t s one a m  that she d been able to surrender and
come in with the requisite hopeless desperation  etc  gately didn t wince when he heard about pat s stroke because his mom hadn t

 had d t s or a classic stroke  but rather a cirrhotic hemorrhage that made her choke and deprived her brain of oxygen and had
irreparably vegetabilized her brain  the two cases were totally  like  apart in his mind  pat m  was never in any way a motherfigure for gately  pat liked to smile and say  when residents pissed and moaned about their own addictions  losses during the
weekly house community meeting  she d nod and smile and say that for her  the stroke had been far and away the best thing that s
ever happened to her because it enabled her to finally surrender  she d come to ennet house in an electric wheelchair at thirty two
and been unable to communicate except via like morse code blinks or something for the first six months        but had even
without use of her arms demonstrated a willingness to try and eat a rock when the founding guy who didn t even use his first
name told her to  using her torso and neck to like chop downwardly at the rock and chipping both incisors  you can still see the
caps at the corners   and had gotten sober  and remarried a different and older south shore like trillionaire with what sounded like
psychotic kids  and but regained an unexpected amount of function  and had been working at the house ever since  the right side
of her face was still pulled way over in this sort of rictus  and her speech took gately some getting used to   it sounded like she
was still loaded all the time  a kind of overenunciated slurring  the half of her face that wasn t rictusized was very pretty  and she
had very long pretty red hair  and a sexually credible body even though her right arm had atrophied into a kind of semiclaw       and the right hand was strapped into this black plastic brace to keep its nail extensioned fingers from curling into her
palm  and pat walked with a dignified but godawful lurch  dragging a terribly thin right leg in black leather pants behind her like
something hanging on to her that she was trying to get away from 
during his residency  she d gone personally with gately on most of his bigger court dates  driving him up to the north shore
in the killer aventura with its handicapped plates   she because of the neurological right leg thing literally had a lead foot  and
drove all the time like a maniac  and gately had usually almost wet himself on rte      and she d throw all en net house s
substantial respect and clout behind him with judges and boards  until every issue that could be resolved without finding was
blue filed  gately still couldn t figure out why all the personal extra attention and help  it was like he d been pat m  s biggest
favorite among the residents last year  she did have favorites and nonfavorites  it was probably unavoidable  annie parrot and the
counselors and house manager always had their particular favorites  too  so it all tended to work out square 
about four months into his ennet house residency  the agonizing desire to ingest synthetic narcotics had been mysteriously
magically removed from don gately  just like the house staff and the crocodiles at the white flag group had said it would if he
pounded out the nightly meetings and stayed minimally open and willing to persistently ask some extremely vague higher power
to remove it  the desire  they said to get creakily down on his mammoth knees in the a m  every day and ask god as he
understood him to remove the agonizing desire  and to hit the old knees again at night before sack and thank this god ish figure
for the substanceless day just ended  if he got through it  they suggested he keep his shoes and keys under the bed to help him
remember to get on his knees  the only times gately had ever been on his knees before were to throw up or mate  or shunt a lowon the wall alarm  or if somebody got lucky during a beef and landed one near gately s groin  he didn t have any god  or j c background  and the knee stuff seemed like the limpest kind of dickless pap  and he felt like a true hypocrite just going through
the knee motions that he went through faithfully every a m  and p m   without fail  motivated by a desire to get loaded so horrible
that he often found himself humbly praying for his head to just finally explode already and get it over with  pat had said it didn t
matter at this point what he thought or believed or even said  all that mattered was what he did  if he did the right things  and kept
doing them for long enough  what gately thought and believed would magically change  even what he said  she d seen it happen
again and again  and to some awfully unlikely candidates for change  she said it had happened to her  the left side of her face was
very alive and kind  and gately s counselor  an ex coke and  phone bunko guy whose left ear had been one of his losses  had hit
gately early on with the infamous boston aa cake analogy  the grizzled filipino had met with the resident don g  once a week 
driving gately around brighton allston in aimless circles in a customized subaru  x  just like the ones gately used to hotwire
and promote to use for burgling  eugenio martinez had this eccentric thing where he maintained he could only be in touch with
his own higher power when he was driving  down near e w d  s barge docks off the allston spur one night he invited gately to
think of boston aa as a box of betty crocker cake mix  gately had smacked himself in the forehead at yet another limp oblique
gene m  analogy  which gene had already bludgeoned him with several insectile tropes for thinking about the disease  the
counselor had let him vent spleen for a while  smoking as he crawled along behind land barges lined up to unload  he told gately
to just imagine for a second that he s holding a box of betty crocker cake mix  which represented boston aa  the box came with
directions on the side any eight year   old could read  gately said he was waiting for the mention of some kind of damn insect
inside the cake mix  gene m  said all gately had to do was for fuck s sake give himself a break and relax and for once shut up and
just follow the directions on the side of the fucking box  it didn t matter one fuckola whether gately like believed a cake would
result  or whether he understood the like fucking baking chemistry of how a cake would result  if he just followed the
motherfucking directions  and had sense enough to get help from slightly more experienced bakers to keep from fucking the directions up if he got confused somehow  but basically the point was if he just followed the childish directions  a cake would result 
he d have his cake  the only thing gately knew about cake was that the frosting was the best part  and he personally found
eugenio martinez a smug and self righteous prick   plus he d always distrusted both orientals and spies  and gene m  managed
to seem like both   but he didn t screw out of the house or quite do anything they could discharge him for  and he went to
meetings nightly and told the more or less truth  and he did the shoe under bed knee thing every a m  p m        and he took the
suggestion to join a group and get rabidly active and clean up ashtrays and go out speaking on commitments  he had nothing in
the way of a like god concept  and at that point maybe even less than nothing in terms of interest in the whole thing  he treated
prayer like setting an oven temp according to a box s direction  thinking of it as talking to the ceiling was somehow preferable to
imagining talking to nothing  and he found it embarrassing to get down on his knees in his underwear  and like the other guys in
the room he always pretended his sneakers were like way under the bed and he had to stay down there a while to find them and get
them out  when he prayed  but he did it  and beseeched the ceiling and thanked the ceiling  and after maybe five months gately
was riding the greenie at      to go clean human turds out of the shattuck shower and all of a sudden realized that quite a few
days had gone by since he d even thought about demerol or talwin or even weed  not just merely getting through those last few
days   substances hadn t even occurred to him  i e  the desire and compulsion had been removed  more weeks went by  a blur
of commitments and meetings and gasper smoke and cliches  and he still didn t feel anything like his old need to get high  he

 was  in a way  free  it was the first time he d been out of this kind of mental cage since he was maybe ten  he couldn t believe it 
he wasn t grateful so much as kind of suspicious about it  the removal  how could some kind of higher power he didn t even
believe in magically let him out of the cage when gately had been a total hypocrite in even asking something he didn t believe in
to let him out of a cage he had like zero hope of ever being let out of  when he could only get himself on his knees for the prayers
in the first place by pretending to look for his shoes  he couldn t for the goddamn life of him understand how this thing worked 
this thing that was working  it drove him bats  at about seven months  at the little sunday beginners  mtg   he actually cracked
one of the provident s fake wood tabletops beating his big square head against it       
white flagger   ferocious   francis gehaney  one of the most ancient and gnarled of the crocodiles  had a white crew cut and
skallycap and suspenders over the flannel shirt that encased his gut  and an enormous cucumber shaped red schnoz you could
actually see whole arteries in the skin of  and brown stumpy teeth and emphysema and a portable little oxygen tank thing whose
blue tube was held under the schnoz with white tape  and the very clear bright eye whites that went along with the extremely low
resting pulse rate of a guy with geologic amounts of sober aa time  ferocious francis g   whose mouth was never without a
toothpick and who had on his right forearm a faded martini glass and naked lady tattoo of korean war vintage  who d gotten
sober under the nixon administration and who communicated in the obscene but antiquated epigrams the crocs all used        
f f  had taken gately out for eye rattling amounts of coffee  after the incident with the table and the head  he d listened with the
slight boredom of detached identification to gately s complaint that there was no way something he didn t understand enough to
even start to believe in was seriously going to be interested in helping save his ass  even if he she it did in some sense exist 
gately still doesn t quite know why it helped  but somehow it helped when ferocious francis suggested that maybe anything
minor league enough for don gately to understand probably wasn t going to be major league enough to save gately s addled ass
from the well dressed sergeant at arms  now  was it 
that was months ago  gately usually no longer much cares whether he understands or not  he does the knee and ceiling thing
twice a day  and cleans shit  and listens to dreams  and stays active  and tells the truth to the ennet house residents  and tries to
help a couple of them if they approach him wanting help  and when ferocious francis g  and the white flaggers presented him 
on the september sunday that marked his first year sober  with a faultlessly baked and heavily frosted one candle cake  don
gately had cried in front of nonrelatives for the first time in his life  he now denies that he actually did cry  saying something
about candle fumes in his eye  but he did 
gately is an unlikely choice for ennet house chef  having fed for most of the last twelve years on sub shop subs and
corporate snack foods consumed amid some sort of motion  he is     cm  and     kg  and had never once eaten broccoli or a pear
until last year  chef wise  he offers up an exceptionless routine of  boiled hot dogs  dense damp meat loaf with little pieces of
american cheese and half a box of cornflakes on top  for texture  cream of chicken soup over spirochete shaped noodles 
ominously dark  leathery shake  n bake chicken legs  queasily underdone hamburgs  and hamburg sauce spaghetti whose pasta
he boils for almost an hour        none but the most street hardened ennet residents would ever hazard an open crack about the
food  which appears nightly at the long dinner table still in the broad steaming pans it was cooked in  with gately s big face
hovering lun arly above it  flushed and beaded under the floppy chef s hat annie parrot had given him as a dark joke he hadn t got 
his eyes full of anxiety and hopes for everyone s full enjoyment  basically looking like a nervous bride serving her first conjugal
dish  except this bride s hands are the same size as the house s dinner plates and have jailhouse tatts on them  and this bride seems
to need no oven mitts as he sets down massive pans on the towels that have to be laid down to keep the plastic tabletop from
searing  any sort of culinary comments are always extremely oblique  randy lenz up at the northeast corner likes to raise his can
of tonic and say that don s food is the kind of food that helps you really appreciate whatever you re drinking along with it 
geoffrey day talks about what a refreshing change it is to leave a dinner table not feeling bloated  wade mcdade  a young hardcore flask alkie from ashland ky  and doony glynn  who s still woozy and infirm from some horrendous workers comp  scam
gone awry last year  and is constantly sickly and who s probably going to get discharged soon for losing his menial job at
brighton fence   wire and not even pretending to look for another one   the two have this bit they do on spaghetti night where
mcdade comes into the living room right before chow and goes  some of that extra fine spay ghetti tonight  doonster   and doony
glynn goes  ooo  will it be all lovely and soft   and mcdade goes  leave your teeth at home  boy  in the voice of a kentucky
sheriff  leading glynn to the table by the hand as if glynn were a damaged child  they take care to do the bit while gately s still in
the kitchen tossing salad and worrying about course presentation  though tiny ewell never fails to thank gately for the meal  and
april cortelyu is lavish in her praises  and burt f  smith always rolls his eyes with pleasure and makes yummy noises whenever
he can get a fork to his mouth 

pre dawn    may   y d a u  outcropping northwest of tucson az u s a   still
 do you remember hearing   u s o u s  s hugh steeply said   in your own country  in the late i think b s     s  of an
experimental program  a biomedical experiment  involving the idea of electro implantations in the human brain   steeply  at the
shelf s lip  turned to look  marathe merely looked back at him  steeply said   no  some sort of radical advance  stereo taxy 
epilepsy treatment  they proposed to implant tiny little hair thin electrodes in the brain  some leading canadian neurologist  
elder  elders  something   at the time had hit on evidence that certain tiny little stimulations in certain brain areas could prevent
a seizure  as in an epileptic seizure  they implant electrodes   hair thin  just a few millivolts or   
 briggs electrodes  
 beg pardon  
marathe coughed slightly   also the type used in pacemakers of the heart  
steeply felt his lip   i m thinking i m recalling a tentative bio entry saying your father had had a pacemaker  
marathe touched his own face absently  the plutonium     pack of power  the briggs electrode  the kenbeck dc circuit  i
am recalling terms and instructions  avoid all microwaving ovens and many transmitters  cremation for burial forbidden   this is
because of plutonium      
 so but you know of this old program with epileptics  experiments they thought could avoid ablative surgery for severe

 epilepsy  
marathe said nothing and made what might be seen as slightly shaking the head 
steeply turned back to face the east with his hands clasped before his back  wishing to speak of it one way or another way 
marathe could tell 
 i can t remember if i read about it or heard a lecture or what  the implantation was a pretty inexact science  it was all
experimental  a whole lot of electrodes had to be implanted in an incredibly small area in the temporal lobe to hope to find the
nerve terminals that involved epileptic seizures  and it was trial and error  stimulating each electrode and checking the reaction  
 temporal lobes of the brain   marathe said 
 what happened was that olders and the canadian neuroscientists happened to find  during all the trial and error  that firing
certain electrodes in certain parts of the lobes gave the brain intense feelings of pleasure   steeply looked back over his shoulder at
marathe   i mean we re talking about intense pleasure  remy  i m remembering olders called these little strips of stimulatable
pleasure tissue p terminals  
   p  wishing to mean  the pleasure  
 and that their location seemed maddeningly inexact and unpredictable  even within brains of the same species   a pterminal d turn out to be right up next to some other neuron whose stimulation would cause pain  or hunger  or god knows what  
 the human brain is very dense  it is the truth  
 the whole point is they weren t doing it on humans yet  it was regarded as radically experimental  they used animals and
animal lobes  but soon the pleasure stimulation phenomenon was its own separate radical experiment  while the second string
neuro team stuck with the epileptic animals  older   or elder  some anglo canadian name   headed the team to map these
what he called quote  rivers of reward   the p terminals in the lobes  
marathe idly felt at the little pills of cotton in his windbreaker s cotton pockets  pleasantly nodding   an experimental program
of canada  you stated  
 i even remember  the brandon psychiatric center  
marathe pretended to cough in the recognition of this   this is a mental hospital  the far north of manitoba  forbidding
wastelands  the center of nothing  
 because they were theorizing that these quote  rivers  or terminals were also the brain s receptors for things like betaendorphins  l dopa  q dopa  serotonin  all the various neurotransmitters of pleasure  
 the department of euphoria  so to speak  within the human brain  
there was no hint or suggestion yet of dawn or light 
 but not humans yet   steeply said   older s earliest subject were rats  and the results were apparently sobering  the nu  the
canadians found that if they rigged an auto stimulation lever  the rat would press the lever to stimulate his    terminal over and
over  thousands of times an hour  over and over  ignoring food and female rats in heat  completely fixated on the lever s
stimulation  day and night  stopping only when the rat finally died of dehydration or simple fatigue  
marathe said  not of the pleasure itself  however  
 i think dehydration  i m fuzzy on just what the rat died of  
marathe shrugged   but the envy of all experimental rats everywhere  this rat  i think  
 then likewise implantations and levers for cats  dogs  swine  monkeys  primates  even a dolphin  
 up the evolving scale  p terminals for each  each died  
 eventually   steeply said   or else they had to be lobotomized  because i remember even if the pleasure electrode was
removed  the stimulation lever removed  the subject d run around pressing anything that could be pressed or flipped  trying to get
one more jolt  
 the dolphin  probably it swam about and did this  i think  
 you seem amused by this  remy  this was totally a canadian show  this little neuroelectric adventure  
 i am amused while you make a way toward your point so slowly  
 because then eventually elder and company of course wanted to try human subjects  to see whether the human lobe had pterminals and so on  and because of the sobering consequences for the subject animals in the program they couldn t legally use
prisoners or patients  they had to try to secure volunteers  
 because of a risk   marathe said 
 the whole thing was apparently a nightmare of canadian legalities and statutes  
marathe pursed the lips   i have doubts in my mind  ottawa could easily have asked your then cia for  what is the term 
 persons of expendability  from southeast asia or negroes  the subjects expended for your inspiring u s a  s mk ultra        
steeply elected ignoring this  rummaging in the purse   but what apparently happened was that somehow word of the pterminal discovery and experiments had gotten out up in manitoba   some low level worker at brandon had broken security and
leaked word  
 very little else to do in northern manitoba besides leaking and gossiping  
     and suddenly the neuro team at brandon pull in to work one day and find human volunteers lining up literally around the
block outside the place  able bodied and i should remember to recall mostly young canadians  lining up and literally trampling
each other in their desire to sign up as volunteers for p terminal electrode implantation and stimulation  
 in full knowledge of the rat s and dolphin s death  from pressing the lever  
marathe s father had always assigned it to remy  his youngest  to go first inside some public restaurant or shop to check for
the presence of a microwave or gc type of transmitter  of special concerns were stores with instruments for thwarting a
shoplifter  the shrieking instruments at doors 
steeply said  and of course this eagerness for implantation put a whole new disturbing spin on the study of human pleasure
and behavior  and a whole new brandon hospital team was hastily assembled to study the psych profiles of all these people
willing to trample one another to undergo invasive brain surgery and foreign object implantation   
 to become some crazed rats  

    all just for the chance at this kind of pleasure  and the m m p i s and millon s and approception tests on all these hordes
of prospective volunteers   the hordes were told it was part of the screening   the scores came out fascinatingly  chillingly
average  normal  
 in other words not any deviants  
 nonabnormal along every axis they could see  just regular young people   canadian young people  
 volunteering for fatal addiction to the electrical pleasure  
 but remy  apparently the purest  most refined pleasure imaginable  the neural distillate of  say  orgasm  religious
enlightenment  ecstatic drugs  shiatsu  a crackling fire on a winter night   the sum of all possible pleasures refined into pure
current and deliverable at the flip of a hand held lever  thousands of times an hour  at will  
marathe gave him a bland look 
steeply examined a cuticle   by free choice  of course  
marathe assumed an expression that lampooned a dullard s hard thought   thus  but how long before these leaks and rumors
of p terminals reach the ottawa of government and public weal  for canada s government reacts with horror at the prospect of
this  
 oh  and not just ottawa   steeply said   you can see the implications if a technology like elder s really became available  i
know ottawa informed turner  bush  casey  whoever it was at the time  and everyone at langley bit their knuckle in horror  
 the cia chewed a hand  
 because surely you can see the implications for any industrialized  market driven  high discretionary spending society  
 but it would be illegalized   marathe said  noting to remember the various routines of movements steeply made for keeping
warm 
 stop with the babe in woods charade   steeply said   there was still the prospect of an underground market exponentially
more pernicious than narcotics or lsd  the electrode and lever technology looked expensive at the time  but it was easy to
foresee enormous widespread demand bringing it down to where electrodes d be no more exotic than syringes  
 but yes  but surgery  this would be a different matter to implant  
 plenty of surgeons were already willing to perform illegal procedures  abortions  electric penile implants  
 the mk ultra surgeries  
steeply laughed without mirth   or off the record amputations for daring young train cultists  no  
marathe blew just one nostril of his nose  this was the quebecois way  one of the nostrils at a time  marathe s father s
generation  they had used to bend and blow the one nostril out into the gutter in the street 
steeply said  picture millions of average nonabnormal north americans  all implanted with briggs electrodes  all with
electronic access to their own personal p terminals  never leaving home  thumbing their personal stimulation levers over and

 you can maybe see the analogy   steeply said  over the shoulders to smile in a wry way   in canada  my friend  this was  
marathe made a very slight version of his rotary motion of impatience   from the a d      s of time  this never has come to
be  there would have been no development of the happy patch     
 we both went in  both our nations

 ottawa first cutting the brandon program s funding  which turner or casey or whoever howled at   our old cia wanted the
procedure developed and perfected  then classified   military use or something  
marathe said  but the civilian guardians of the weal of the public felt differently  
t think i m remembering carter was president  both our combined nations made it a security priority  shutting it down  our

steeply turned  fiddling with an emery board   but you don t see a more specific analogy with the entertainment  
marathe tongued the inside of his cheek   you are saying the entertainment  a somehow optical stimulation of the pterminals  a way to bypass briggs electrodes for orgasm and massage pleasures  
the dry rasp of the emerying a nail   all i m saying is analogy  a precedent in your own nation  
 us  our nation is the quebec nation  manitoba is   
 i m saying that if he could get past the blind desire for harm against the u s   your m  fortier might be induced to see just

then tonight  at the prospect of boiled hot dogs  the two newest residents had pulled the typically standard new resident
princess and pea special food issue thing  the new today girl amy j  that just sits there on the vinyl couch shaking like an aspen
and having people bring her coffee and light her gaspers and with just short of a like helpless victim  please coddle
sign hung around her neck now claiming red dye    gives her  cluster migraines   gately gives this girl like a week tops before
she s a vapor trail back to the xanax        she has that look   and the weirdly familiar but southernish sounding girl joelle van

 d  with the past believing bod and the linen face announcing she was a vegetarian and would  rather eat a bug  than even get
downwind of a boiled frank  and but in an incredible move pat m  has asked gately  at like   ooh   to blast down to the purity
supreme down in allston and pick up some eggs and peppers so the two new delicate tummied newcomers can make themselves
quiche or whatever  to gately s way of thinking  this looks like catering to just the sort of classic addict s claim of special
uniqueness that it s supposed to be pat s job to help break down  the joelle v d  girl seems to have like inordinate immediate
weight and pet status with pat  who s already making noises about exempting the girl from the menial job requirement  and wants
gately to look for some kind of weird big red soda water tonic for the girl  who s apparently still dehydrated  it s sure a long
way from making somebody chew feldspar  gately has long since quit trying to figure pat monte sian out 
it s a weird weather evening  both thundering and spitting snow  gately had finally become able to distinguish genuine
thunder from the enfield sounds of athscme fans and e w d  catapults  this after nine months of wearing a goodwill rainslicker every morning on the      green line 
one of the possible weak spots in gately s aa recovery program of rigorous personal honesty is that once he s jammed
himself into a black as water aventura and watched the spoiler throb as he turns over the carnivorous engine  etc   he often finds
himself taking a little bit less of a direct route to a given ennet errand site than he probably could  if he had to come right down to
the heart of the issue he likes to cruise around town in pat s car  he s able to minimize the suspicious time any particular bit of
extra cruising adds to his errands by basically driving like a lunatic  ignoring lights  cutting people off  scoffing at one ways 
veering wildly in and out  making pedestrians drop things and lunge curbward  leaning on a horn that sounds more like an air raid
siren  you d think this would be judicially insane  in terms of not having a license and facing a no license jail bit anyway  but the
fact is that this sort of on the way to the e r  with a passenger in labor driving doesn t usually raise so much as an eyebrow
among boston s finest  since they have more than enough other stuff to attend to  in these troubled times  and since everybody
else in metro boston drives exactly the same socio pathic way  including the finest themselves  so that the only real risk gately s
running is to his own sense of rigorous personal honesty  one cliche he s found especially serviceable w r t the aventura issue is
that recovery is about progress not perfection  he likes to make a stately left onto commonwealth and wait to get out of view of
the house s bay window and then produce what he imagines is a rebel yell and open her up down the serpentine tree lined
boulevard of the ave  as it slithers through bleak parts of brighton and allston and past boston u  and toward the big triangular
citgo neon sign and the back bay  he passes the unexamined life club  where he no longer goes  at   ooh  already throbbing
with voices and bass under its ceaseless neon bottle  and then the great gray numbered towers of the brighton projects  where he
definitely no longer goes  scenery starts to blur and distend at    kph  comm  ave  splits enfield brighton allston from the
downscale north edge of brookline on the right  he passes the meat colored facades of anonymous brookline tenements  father  
son market  a dumpster nest  burger kings  blanchard s liquors  an interlace outlet  a land barge alongside another dumpsternest  corner bars and clubs   play it again sam s  harper s ferry  bunratty s  rathskeller  father s first i and ii   a cvs  two
interlace outlets right next to each other  the ellis the rim man sign  the marty s liquors that they rebuilt like ants the week
after it burned down  he passes the hideous riley s roast beef where the allston group gathers to pound coffee before
commitments  the giant distant citgo sign s like a triangular star to steer by  he s doing    k down a straightaway  keeping
abreast of an inbound green line train ramming downhill on the slightly raised track that splits comm  s lanes into two and two 
he likes to match a green train at    k all the way down commonwealth s integral   and see how close he can cut beating it across
the tracks at the brighton ave  split  it s a vestige  he d admit it s like a dark vestige of his old low self esteem suicidal thrill
behaviors  he doesn t have a license  it s not his car  it s a priceless art object car  it s his boss s car  who he owes his life to and
sort of maybe loves  he s on a vegetable run for shattered husks of newcomers just out of detox whose eyes are rolling around in
their heads  has anybody mentioned gately s head is square  it s almost perfectly square  massive and boxy and mysticetously
blunt  the head of somebody who looks like he likes to lower his head and charge  he used to let people open and close elevator
doors on his head  break things across his head  the  indestructible  in his childhood cognomen referred to the head  his left ear
looks a bit like a prizefighter s left ear  the head s nearly flat on top  so that his hair  long in back but with short prince valiant
bangs in front  looks sort of like a carpet remnant someone s tossed on the head and let slide slightly back but stay        nobody
that lives in these guano spotted old brown buildings along comm  with bars on the low floors  windows       ever goes inside 
it seems like  even in thunder and little asterisks of snow  all kinds of olive spanish and puke white irish are on every corner 
bullshitting and trying to look like they re just out there waiting for something important and drinking out of tallboys wrapped
tight in brown bags  a strange nod to discretion  the bags  wrapped so tight the outline of the cans can t be missed  a shore boy 
gately d never used a paper bag around streetcorner cans  it s like a city thing  the aventura can do    kph in third gear  the
engine never strains or whines  just eventually starts to sound hostile  is how you to know to hurt your hip and shift  the
aventura s instrument panel looks more like the instrument panel of military aircraft  something s always blinking and indicating 
one of the blinking lights is supposed to tell you when to shift  pat has told him to ignore the panel  he loves to make the driver sside window go down and rest his left elbow on the jamb like a cabbie 
he s caught behind a bus whose big square ass is in both lanes and he can t get around it in time to beat the train across the
split  though  and the train crosses in front of the bus with a blast of its farty sounding horn and what gately sees as a kind of
swagger to its jiggle on the street level track  he can see people bouncing around inside the train  holding on to straps and bars 
below the split on comm  it s boston u   kenmore and fenway  berklee school of music  the citgo sign s still off in the
distance ahead  you have to go a shocking long way to actually get to the big sign  which everybody says is hollow and you can
get up inside there and stick your head out in a pulsing neon sea but nobody s ever personally been up in there 
arm out like a hack s arm  gately blasts through b u  country  as in backpack and personal stereo and designer fatigues
country  soft faced boys with backpacks and high hard hair and seamless foreheads  totally lineless untroubled foreheads like
cream cheese or ironed sheets  all the storefronts here are for clothes or tp cartridges or posters  gately s had lines in his big
forehead since he was about twelve  it s here he especially likes making people throw their packages in the air and dive for the
curb  b u  girls who look like they ve eaten nothing but dairy products their whole lives  girls who do step aerobics  girls with
good combed long clean hair  nonaddicted girls  the weird hopelessness at the heart of lust  gately hasn t had sex in almost two
years  at the end of the demerol he physically couldn t  then in boston aa they tell you not to  not in your first year clean  if you

 want to be sure to hang in  but they like omit to tell you that after that year s gone by you re going to have forgotten how to even
talk to a girl except about surrender and denial and what it used to be like out there in the cage  gately s never had sex sober yet 
or danced  or held somebody s hand except to say the our father in a big circle  he s gone back to having wet dreams at age
twenty nine 
gately s found he can get away with smoking in the aventura if he opens the passenger window too and makes sure no ashes
go anywhere  the cross wind through the open car is brutal  he smokes menthols  he d switched to menthols at four months clean
because he couldn t stand them and the only people he knew that smoked them were niggers and he d figured that if menthols
were the only gaspers he let himself smoke he d be more likely to quit  and now he can t stand anything but menthols  which
calvin t  says are even worse for you because they got little bits of asbestosy shit in the filter and whatnot  but gately had been
living in the little male live in staffer s room down in the basement by the audio pay phone and tonic machines for like two
months before it turned out the health guy came and inspected and said all the big pipes up at the room s ceiling were insulated in
ancient asbestos that was coming apart and asbestosizing the room  and gately had to move all his shit and the furniture out into
the open basement and guys in white suits with oxygen tanks went in and stripped everything off the pipes and went over the
room with what smells like it was a flamethrower  then hauled the decayed asbestos down to e w d  in a welded drum with a
skull on it  so gately figures menthol gaspers are probably the least of his lung worries at this point 
you can get on the storrow           off comm  ave  below kenmore via this long twiny overpass shadowed road that
cuts across the fens  basically the storrow     is an urban express route that runs along the bright blue chuck all the way along
cambridge s spine  the charles is vivid even under gloomy thundering skies  gately has decided to buy the newcomers  omelette
stuff at bread   circus in inman square  cambridge  it will explain delay  and will be a subtle nonverbal stab at unique dietary
requests in general  bread   circus is a socially hyperresponsible overpriced grocery full of cambridge green party granolacrunchers  and everything s like micro biotic and fertilized only with organic genuine llama shit  etc  the aventura s low driver s
seat and huge windshield afford your thinking man maybe a little more view of the sky than he d like  the sky is low and gray and
loose and seems to hang  there s something baggy about the sky  it s impossible to tell whether snow is still actually falling or
whether just a little snow that s already fallen is blowing around  to get to inman square you veer over three lines to get off the
storrow     on prospect st  s ramp of death and slalom between the sinkholes and go right  north  and take prospect through
central square and all the way north through heavy ethnicity up almost into somerville 
inman square  too  is someplace gately rarely goes anymore  because it s in cambridge s little lisbon  heavily portuguese 
which means also brazilians in the antiquated bellbottoms and flare collared leisure suits they ve never let go of  and where there
are disco ized brazilians can cocaine and narcotics ever be far away  the district s brazilians are another solid rationale for
driving at excessive rates of speed  for gately  plus gately s solidly pro american  and north of central square s clot and snarl
prospect st  s a copless straight shot through eerily alien lands  billboards in spanish  plaster madonnas in fenced front yards 
intricately latticed grape arbors looking seized and clutched at  now  by networks of finger thick bare woody vines  ads for lottery
tickets in what isn t quite spanish  all the houses gray  more bright plastic madonnas in nunnish getups on peeling front porches 
stores and bodegas and low suspension cars triple parked  an all out full cast creche type scene hung from a second floor balcony 
clotheslines hanging between houses  gray houses in rows squished right up next to each other in long rows with tiny toy strewn
yards  and tall  the houses  like being squished in from either side distends them  a couple canadian and nuck owned stores
mashed in here and there  between the propinquous spanish three deckers  looking subjugated and exiled and etc  the street shitty
with litter and holes  indifferent drainage  big assed girls stuffed like stuffed sausage into cigarette jeans in always trios in the
twilight with that weird blond brown hair portuguese girls dye their hair to  a store in good old english advertising chickens
fresh killed daily  ryle s jazz club s upscale pub type bar  guys in tweed caps and briar pipes in mouths at angles taking all day
on a pint of warm stout  gately s always thought dark beer tasted like cork  an intriguing single decker medical looking bldg 
with a sort of tympanum over the smoked glass door with an ad that says complete destruction of confidential
records that gately s always wanted to poke the old head in and have a look at what on earth they might be up to in there 
little portuguese markets with food in there you can t even tell what species it s from  once at a portuguese take out at inman
square s east end a coke whore tried to get gately to eat something that had tentacles  he had a sub instead  gately now simply
blows through inman  heading for b c over on the upscale northwest side nearer to harvard  every light suddenly green and
kind  the aventura s ten cylinder backwash raising an odd little tornado of discarded ad leaflets and glassine bags and corporatesnack bags and a syringe s husk and filterless gasper butts and general crud and a flattened millennial fizzy cup  like from a stand 
which whirls in his exhaust  the tornado of waste does  moving behind him as the last pearly curve of the sun through baggy
clouds is eaten by the countless sancta something and then whitewashed wasp church roofs  finials farther west  nearer harvard 
at    k but sustained in its whirl by the strong west breeze as the last of the sun goes and a blue black shadow quietly fills the
canyon of prospect  whose streetlights don t work for the same municipal reasons the street is in such crummy repair  and one
piece of the debris gately s raised and set spinning behind him  a thick flattened m f  cup  caught by a sudden gust as it falls 
twirling  is caught at some aerodyne s angle and blown spinning all the way to the storefront of one  antitoi enter tainent       
on the street s east side  and hits  its waxed bottom making a clunk  hits the glass pane in the locked front shop door with a sound
for all the world like the rap of a knuckle  so that in a minute a burly bearded thoroughly canadian figure in one of those
canadianly inevitable checked flannel shirts appears out of the dim light in the shop s back room and wipes its mouth on first one
sleeve then the other and opens up the front door with a loud hinge squeak and looks around a bit  viz  for who knocked  looking
not overly pleased at being interrupted at what his sleeves betray as a foreign supper  and also  below that harried expression 
looking edgy and emotionally pale  which might explain the x of small arms ammo belts across his checked chest and the rather
absurdly large     revolver tucked and straining in the waistband of his jeans  lucien antitoi s equally burly partner and brother
bertraund   currently still back there in the little back room where they sleep on cots with serious weaponry underneath and
listen to cqbc radio and scheme and smoke killer u s a  hydroponic dope and cut and mount glass and sew flags and cook over
sterno in l l  bean upscale survivalist cookware  he s back there eating habitant soupe aux pois and bread with bread   circus
molasses and some sort of oblong blue veined patties of a meat your thinking american wouldn t even want to try to identify  
bertraund s forever laughing in quebecois and telling lucien he looks forward with humorous anticipation to the day lucien

 forgets to check the big colt s safety before he jams it into the waistband of his pants and goes lumbering around the shop in his
hobnail boots making every reflective and blown glass item in the place tinkle and clink  the unauto matic revolver  it is a
souvenir of affiliation  once or twice doing work of affiliation with the separatist anti o n a n  f l q   they are for the most
part a not very terrifying insurgent cell  the antitois  more or less loners  self contained  a monomitotic cell  eccentric and
borderline incompetent  protected gently by their late regional patron m  guillaume duplessis of the gaspe peninsula  spurned by
f l q  after duplessis s assassination and also ridiculed by the more malignant anti o n a n  cells  betraund antitoi is in charge 
the brains of the outfit  pretty much by default  since lucien antitoi is one of the very few natives of notre rat pays ever who
cannot understand french  just never caught on  and so has very limited veto powers  even when it comes to such harebrained
bertraund schemes as hanging a sword stemmed fleur de lis flag from the nose of a u s a  civic war hero s boyl ston st  statue
when it would simply be cut down by bored o n a n ite chiens courants gendarmes the next morning  or taping bricks to the
return postage paid solicitation cards of sans christe gentle s c u s p  party  or fashioning astroturf doormats with a likeness of
sans christe gentle on them and distributing them gratis to home supply outlets throughout their insurgency grid   puerile and
on the whole rather sad little gestures that m  duplessis would have interdicted with a merry laugh and a friendly hand on
bertraund s bowling ball of a shoulder  but m  duplessis had been martyred  an assassination only o n a n  would be stupid
enough to believe command would be stupid enough to believe was merely an unfortunate burglary and mucus mishap  and
bertraund antitoi  after duplessis s death and f l q  s rejection left to his own conceptual devices for the first time since their allterrain vehicle was packed with quality van buskirk of montreal exotic reflective glasswares and glass blowing hardware and
broom and ordnance and survivalist cookware and hip postcards and black lather gag soap and cheesy old low demand interlace
 rd grid cartridges and hand buzzers and fraudulent but seductive x ray spectacles and they were sent through the remains of
provincial autoroute     u s a     in protective garb they d shed and buried just south of the convexity s bellow s falls vt
o n a n ite checkpoint  sent as a kind of primitive two celled organism to establish a respectable front and abet more malignant
cells and to insurge and terrorize in small sad anti experialist ways  now bertraund has shown a previously duplessis restrained
flair for stupid wastes of time  including this branching out into harmful pharmaceuticals as an attack on the fiber of new new
england s youth   as if the u s a  youth were not already more than fiberless enough  in lucien s mute opinion  bertraund had
actually been credulous enough with a wrinkled long haired person of advanced years in a paisley nehru jacket also of great age
and a puzzling cap with a skeleton playing at the violin emblazoned upon it  on the front  wearing also the most stupid appearing
small round wire spectacles with salmon colored lenses  and also continually forming the letter of v with fingers of his hand and
directing this letter of v at bertraund and lucien   bertraund felt the gesture was a subtle affirmation of solidarity with patriotic
struggle everywhere and stood for victoire  but lucien suspected a u s a  obscenity laughingly flashed at persons who would not
comprehend its insult  just as one of lucien s sadistic ecole speciale tutors back in ste  anne des monts had spent weeks in
second form teaching lucien to say  va cbier  putain   which he  the tutor  claimed meant  look maman i can speak french and
thus finally express my love and devotion to you    bertraund had been starry eyed enough to agree to barter the person an
antique blue lava lamp and a lavender tinged apothecary s mirror for eighteen unexceptional looking and old lozenges the longhaired old person had claimed in a jumble of west swiss accented french were     mg  of a trop formidable harmful
pharmaceutical no longer available and guaranteed to make one s most hair raising psychedelic experience look like a day on the
massage tables of a basel hot springs resort  throwing in as well a kitchen can waste bag filled with crusty old mossy boot andleg read only cartridges  sans any labels  that appeared to have been stored in a person s rear yard and then run through a gaseous
dryer of clothes  as if lucien did not have already more than plenty of crusty old cartridges which bertraund removed from interlace dumpsters or was cheated in barters for and brought back to the shop for lucien s job to view and label and organize the
cartridges for storing and were never bought except the occasional cartridge in portuguese  or porno graphical  and the aged
person had flopped off in his cap and sandals with a lamp and an apothecary s mirror to which lucien had been personally much
attached  particularly to the lavender mirror  flashing this covert obscenity of v and with smiles urging the brothers to write their
name and address on the palm of their hands with the drenching sweat proof ink before they dropped any of the so called  tu saisquoi   if they were going to be the persons who ingested these lozenges 
the front door squeaks loudly of the hinge and lucien recloses it and drives the bolt home  squeak  the upper hinge squeaks
no matter the oil  as the shop drives lucien crazy by becoming again dusty each time the door is opened to the street s grit  and
from the dust of the alley with so many dumpsters behind the back room which bertraund refuses not to open the iron service door
of  to spit  the squeak functions in the place of a customer bell  however  the front knock of the closed door clearly is once again
big bottomed brazilian children playing at unamusing pranks  he does not pull the window shade  but he does grab the stout
trusty homemade broom he sweeps the shop all day with and stands there  chewing anxiously the nail of a thumb  looking out 
lucien antitoi enjoys standing at the door s glass pane and looking blankly out at the light snow of dust bright against the blueshadowed twilight eating the american street outside  the door continues to squeak faintly even after he s driven home the bolt 
he can stand here happily for hours  leaning on the sturdy broom he d carved from a snow snapped limb as a boy during the
gaspe s terrible blizzards of quebec of a d       and bound broom corn onto and sharpened the tip of  as a sort of domestic
weapon  even then  before o n a n ite experialist impost made any sort of struggle or sacrifice remotely necessary  as a silent
boy  keenly interested in weapons and ammunitions of all the different sorts  which along with the size thing helped with the
teasing  he could and does stand here for hours  complexly backlit  transparently reflected  looking at alien traffic and commerce 
he has that rare spinal appreciation for beauty in the ordinary that nature seems to bestow on those who have no native words for
what they see   squeak   the visual bulk of the shoproom of antitoi entertainent is devoted to glass  they have set curved and
planar mirrors at studied angles whereby each part of the room is reflected in every other part  which flusters and disorients
customers and keeps haggling to a minimum  in a sort of narrow fashioned corridor behind one gauntlet of angled glass is their
stock of gags  notions  ironic postcards  and unironic sentimental greeting cards as well        flanking another are shelf after
shelf of used and bootleg interlace and independent and even homemade digital entertainment cartridges  in no discernible order 
since bertraund handles acquisition and lucien s in charge of inventory and order  nevertheless  once he s viewed it even once  he
can identify any used cartridge in stock and will point it out to the rare customer with the sharpened whitewood tip of his
homemade broom  some of the cartridges do not even have labels  they re so obscure or illicit  to keep up with bertraund  lucien

 must watch new acquisitions on the small cheap viewer beside the manual cash register as he sweeps the shop with the imposing
broom he has loved and kept sharpened and polished and floor fuzz free since adolescence  and which he sometimes imagines he
is conversing with  very quietly  telling it to va chier putain in tones surprisingly gentle and kind for such a large terrorist  the
viewer s screen has something wrong with its definition and there is a wobble that makes all cartridge performers on the left
section of it appear to have tourette s syndrome  the pornographical cartridges he finds nonsensical and views them in fast
forward to get them over with as quickly as possible  so but he knows all but the most recent acquisitions  colors and visual plots 
but some still have no labels  he still has not gotten to see and shelve many of the massive assortment bertraund lugged home and
out of the all terrain vehicle in saturday s chilling rain  several old exercise and film cartridges a small back bay
telentertainment outlet was discarding as outdated  also there were one or two bertraund claimed he had picked up literally on
the street downtown from the site of the flag draped shaw statue from untended commercial displays that stupidly contained detachable cartridges anyone could detach and lug home in the rain  the displays  cartridges he had immediately viewed  for though
they were unlabelled save for a commercialed slogan in tiny raised letters of il ne faut plus qu on pursuive le bonheur  
which to lucien antitoi signified zilch   each was stamped also with a circle and arc that resembled a disembodied smile  which
made lucien himself smile and pop them in right away  to find to his disappointment and impatience with bertraund that they
were blank  without even hd static  just as the old rude person s bartered tapes he had removed from the waste bag of their
storage for viewing had proved  blank beyond static  to the satisfaction of lucien s disgust        through the door s window 
passing headlights illumine a disabled person in a wheelchair laboring along the rutted walk outside the portuguese grocery opposite antitoi entertainent s storefront  lucien forgets he was eating bread with upscale molasses and soupe aux pois  he forgets he
is eating the moment the food s taste leaves his mouth  his mind is usually as clean and transparent as anything in the shop  he
sweeps a little  absently  in front of the pane  watching his face s reflection bob against the blackening night outside  light
snowfall almost is bouncing back and forth between sides of prospect s canyon  the broom s bristles say  hush  hush   the tinand static sound of cqbc has been silenced  he can hear bertraund moving about rattling some pans and dropping one  and
lucien works his sharp pointed broom against the chipped portuguese tile of the nonwood floor  he is a gifted domestic  the best
    kilo domestic ever to wear a beard and suspenders of small arms ordnance  the shop  crammed to the acoustic tile ceiling and
dustless  resembles a junkyard for anal retentives  he bobs and sweeps  and bobbing shafts of mirror light gleam and dance 
backed by night  in the locked door s pane  the figure in the wheelchair still labors at his wheels  but appears  queerly  still to be
where he was before  in front of the portuguese grocery  moving closer to the pane  so that his face s transparent image fills the
glass and he can now see clearly beyond it  lucien sees that what it is is it s a different figure in a different wheelchair from the
one before  this new figure s face also downcasted and queerly masked  laboring around the sidewalk s jagged holes  and that not
too far behind this seated figure is yet another figure in a wheelchair  coming this way  and as lucien antitoi twists his head and
presses his hairy cheek to the glass of the squeaking door   except but now how can a door s upper hinge loudly squeak when the
door is tightly closed and the bolt driven home with the solid snick of a     bullet slipping home in a revolver s chamber   
looking due southeast up prospect  lucien can see the variegated glints of passing low chassis headlights off a whole long singlefile column of polished metal wheels stolidly turning  being turned by swarthy hands in fingerless wheelchair gloves   squeak  
 squeak   lucien has been hearing squeaks for several minutes from what he had naively like the babe assumed was the door s
upper hinge  this hinge does truly squeak        but lucien now hears whole systems of squeaks  slow and soft but not stealthy
squeaks  the squeaks of weighted wheelchairs moving slow  implacable  calm and businesslike and yet menacing  moving with the
indifference of things at the very top of the food chain  and  now  turning  heart loud in his head  can now see  in the carefully
placed display mirrors  angles  spikes of light off rotary metal rotating at a height about waist level to a huge standing man w 
broom clutched to barrel chest  there are great quiet numbers of persons in wheelchairs moving in the room with him  in the
shoproom  moving calmly into position behind waist high glass counters full of wacky notions  the street outside is flanked on
both sidewalks by defiles of wheelchaired  blanket lapped persons whose faces are obscured by what look like large and snowdotted leaves  and the shades of the portuguese grocery have been drawn and a ropas sign hung by a circumflex of twine in the
pane of the front door  wheelchair assassins  lucien has been taught the glyph of a profiled wheelchair with an enormous bonecrossed skull below  it is the worst possible scenario  it is worse than o n a n ite gendarmes by far  a f r  whimpering to his
broom  lucien disengages the mammoth colt from his pants and finds that a length of black thread from the denim panel that
surrounds his zipper has gotten looped around the barrel s sight blade and comes ripping out with a long high squeak from the
pants with the convulsive force of his drawing the weapon  so that his pants split open alongside the zipper and the force of his
mammoth canadian gut extends the tear all up and down the front so that the snap unsnaps and the jeans burst open and fall
immediately to his ankles  puddling around his hobnail boots  revealing red union suit underwear beneath and forcing lucien to
take tiny undignified shuffling steps frantically toward the back room as he tries with the thread snagged colt to cover every piece
of fragmented waist high motion the mirror s shards of light reveal in the shoproom while scuttling as fast as the fallen jeans allow
toward the back room to alert  nonverbally  using the sort of demon eyed tongue protruded neck corded tortured rigid bug eyed
face a small child makes when he is playing le monstre  to alert bertraund that they have come  not bostonian gendarmes or

twilight  implacably squeaking  and cannot be reasoned with or bargained with  feel no pity or remorse  or fear  except a rumored
fear of steep hills   and now they re all in here all over the shoproom like faceless rats  the devil s own hamsters  moving with
placid squeaks just beyond view of the shop s mirrored peripheries  regally serene  and lucien  with the big broom in one hand
and the thread webbed colt in the other  tries to cover his little stepped flight with a thunderous shot that goes high and shatters an
angled full length planar door mirror  spraying anodized glass and replacing the reflection of a blanket lapped a f r  wearing a
plastic fleur de lis with sword stem mask on his face with a jagged stelliform hole  with glittered shards and glass dust in the air
all over the place and the unperturbable squeaks    squeak squeak squeak squeak   it is awful   sounding right through clatter
and tinkle and frantic hobnailed bootfalls  and through the flying glass  aiming every which way behind him  lucien bursts almost
falling through the curtains  bug eyed and corded and webbed in thread  to alert bertraund facially that the shot had signified

smily face in thin black lines  who is speculatively dipping a baguette s heel in bertraund s metal soup cup and popping the bread
into his mask s mouth s cheery hole with an elegantly cerise gloved hand  lucien  staring goggle eyed at the only brother he s ever
had  is standing very still  face still unwittingly teratoid  the broom at an angle in his hand  the colt dangling at his side  and the
long black zipper thread he s pulled from his zipper caught somehow now and wrapped around his thumb and hung trailing on the
spotless floor with slack between gun and thumb  his pants woppsed around his red woolen ankles  when he hears a quick efficient
squeak and feels from behind a tremendous wallop on the backs of his knees that drives him down to his knees on the floor  the
    bucking as it discharges by reflex into the wood pattern portuguese tile  so that he s down in a supplicant s posture on his red
knees  encircled by fau teuils des rollents  still holding his broom but now down near the broom corn s wire binding  his face is
now of equal height to the yellow empty smiling chewing face of the a f r  as this leader   everything about him radiates
pitiless and remorseless command   rotates a right wheel to bring himself about and with three squeakless rotations has his
hideous blank black smile within cm  of lucien antitoi s face  the a f r  bids him    soir   sieur   which means nothing to lucien
antitoi  whose chin has caved and lips are quivering  though his eyes are not what you would call jacklighted or terrified eyes 
lucien s brother s pierced and rigid profile is visible over the leader s left shoulder  the man still has some soup sopped bread in
his glove s left hand 
 malheureusement  ton collegue est decede  ii faisait une excellente soupe aux pois   he looks amused   non  ou c etait toi 
faisait elle   the leader leans forward in the graceful way people who always sit can lean  revealing wiry hair and a small and
strangely banal bald spot  and gently removes the hot revolver from lucien s hand  he engages the safety without having to look
at the revolver  spanish language music is thinly audible from somewhere up above the alley  the a f r  looks warmly into
lucien s eyes for a moment  then with a professionally vicious backhanded motion pegs the gun at bertraund s profiled head 
striking bertraund in the side of the head  and bertraund rocks away and then toward and forward and slides forward left off the
rickety camping chair and with a ghastly and moist thump comes to rest chairless but upright  his left hip on the floor  the eye s
sturdy railroad spike s thick tip caught on the edge of the card table and tilted up as the table tilts downward and cookery slides
nautically off and onto the tile as the weight of bertraund s large upper body is somehow held by the spike and tilted table  his
brother s face is now turned away from lucien  and his overall posture is of some person crumpled with hilarity or regret  maybe
beer   a man overcome  lucien  who never has apprehended what the safety switch is or where  thinks it a small miracle that the
colt     with its tail of thread does not discharge again as it wangs off bertraund s temple and hits the slick tile and slides from
sight under a cot  somewhere in the tall house next door a toilet flushes  and the back room s pipes sing  the black thread has
remained snagged on the colt s sight blade and in the middle caught somewhere on bertraund s ear  the other remains also attached to lucien by a persistent hangnail on his well gnawed right thumb  so that a black filament still connects the knelt lucien
to his hidden revolver  with a surreal angled turn at the ear of his overcome frere 
the happy masked a f r  leader  politely ignoring the fact that lucien s sphincter has failed them all in the small room  after
complimenting them both on the craftsmanship of some of the front s blown glass notions  pulls his velvet gloves tighter and tells
lucien that it has fallen to him  lucien  to direct their attention without delay to an entertainment item they have come here to
acquire  and require  this copy capable item  they are here on business  ne pas plaisanter  this is not the social call  they will
acquire this thing and then iront paitre  they have no wish to disturb anyone s repast  but the a f r  fears that it is fearfully urgent

the vigor with which lucien shakes his head at the leader s meaningless sounds can t help but be misinterpreted  probably 
does this shop have the     rpm drive tp somewhere about here  for running masters 
same vigorous negative looking denial of comprehension

from the front of the shop come whole symphonies of squeaks and low trilled r s and the sounds of a densely packed area
being swiftly dismantled and searched  a few legless thick armed men climb the shelves by hand and hang up near the dropceiling by special climbing equipment and suction cups fitted to their stumps  brown arms busy in the upper shelving  dismantling
and searching upside down like obscene industrious bugs  the outline of lucien s quivering mouth is being traced by a mammothtorso d a f r  in a jesuitical collar who holds lucien s own trusty broom inverted and leans in his chair to caress lucien s full
gaspe provincial lips  the lips are quivering  with the handle s wicked tip  which is sharply white  whittled free of the sienna glaze
of broomstick varnish that patinas the rest of the big stick s length  lucien s lips are quivering not so much from fear   although
there is certainly fear   but not from fear so much as in an attempt to form words        words that are not and can never be
words are sought by lucien here through what he guesses to be the maxillofacial movements of speech  and there is a childlike
pathos to the movements that perhaps the rigid grinned a f r  leader can sense  perhaps that is why his sigh is sincere  his
complaint sincere when he complains that what will follow will be inutile  lucien s failure to assist will be inutile  there will be no
point serviced  there are several dozen highly trained and motivated wheelchaired personnel here who will find whatever they seek
and more  anyhow  perhaps it is sincere  the gallic shrug and fatigue of the voice through the leader s mask hole  as lucien s
leonine head is tilted back by a hand in his hair and his mouth opened wide by callused fingers that appear overhead and around
the sides of his head from behind and jack his writhing mouth open so wide that the tendons in his jaws tear audibly and lucien s
first sounds are reduced from howls to a natal gargle as the pale wicked tip of the broom he loves is inserted  the wood pineytasting then white tasteless pain as the broom is shoved in and abruptly down by the big and collared a f r   thrust farther in
rhythmically in strokes that accompany each syllable in the wearily repeated  in u tile  of the technical interviewer  down into
lucien s wide throat and lower  small natal cries escaping around the brown glazed shaft  the strangled impeded sounds of
absolute aphonia  the landed fish gasps that accompany speechlessness in a dream  the cleric collared a f r  driving the broom

 home now to half its length  up on his stumps to get downward leverage as the fibers that protect the esophagal terminus resist and
then give with a crunching pop and splat of red that bathes lucien s teeth and tongue and makes of itself in the air a spout  and his
gargled sounds now sound drowned  and behind fluttering lids the aphrasiac half cellular insurgent who loves only to sweep and
dance in a clean pane sees snow on the round hills of his native gaspe  pretty curls of smoke from chimneys  his mother s linen
apron  her kind red face above his crib  homemade skates and cider steam  chic choc lakes seen stretching away from the capchat hillside they skied down to mass  the red face s noises he knows from the tone are tender  beyond crib and rimed window
gaspesie lake after lake after lake lit up by the near arctic sun and stretching out in the southeastern distance like chips of broken
glass thrown to scatter across the white chic choc country  gleaming  and the river ste  anne a ribbon of light  unspeakably pure 
and as the culcate handle navigates the inguinal canal and sigmoid with a queer deep full hot tickle and with a grunt and shove
completes its passage and forms an obscene erectile bulge in the back of his red sopped johns  bursting then through the wool and
puncturing tile and floor at a police lock s canted angle to hold him upright on his knees  completely skewered  and as the
attentions of the a f r s in the little room are turned from him to the shelves and trunks of the antitois  sad insurgents  lives  and
lucien finally dies  rather a while after he s quit shuddering like a clubbed muskie and seemed to them to die  as he finally sheds
his body s suit  lucien finds his gut and throat again and newly whole  clean and unimpeded  and is free  catapulted home over
fans and the convexity s glass palisades at desperate speeds  soaring north  sounding a bell clear and nearly maternal alarmed callto arms in all the world s well known tongues

winter  b s        sepulveda ca
i remember       i was eating lunch and reading something dull by bazin when my father came into the kitchen and made
himself a tomato juice beverage and said that as soon as i was finished he and my mother needed my help in their bedroom  my
father had spent the morning at the commercial studio and was still all in white  with his wig with its rigid white parted hair  and
hadn t yet removed the television makeup that gave his real face an orange cast in daylight  i hurried up and finished and rinsed
my dishes in the sink and proceeded down the hall to the master bedroom  my mother and father were both in there  the master
bedroom s valance curtains and the heavy lightproof curtain behind them were all slid back and the venetian blinds up  and the
daylight was very bright in the room  the decor of which was white and blue and powder blue 
my father was bent over my parents  large bed  which was stripped of bedding all the way down to the mattress protector  he
was bent over  pushing down on the bed s mattress with the heels of his hands  the bed s sheets and pillows and powder blue
coverlet were all in a pile on the carpet next to the bed  then my father handed me his tumbler of tomato juice to hold for him and
got all the way on top of the bed and knelt on it  pressing down vigorously on the mattress with his hands  putting all his weight
into it  he bore down hard on one area of the mattress  then let up and pivoted slightly on his knees and bore down with equal
vigor on a different area of the mattress  he did this all over the bed  sometimes actually walking around on the mattress on his
knees to get at different areas of the mattress  then bearing down on them  i remember thinking the bearing down action looked
very much like emergency compression of a heart patient s chest  i remember my father s tomato juice had grains of pepperish
material floating on the surface  my mother was standing at the bedroom window  smoking a long cigarette and looking at the
lawn  which i had watered before i ate lunch  the uncovered window faced south  the room blazed with sunlight 
 eureka   my father said  pressing down several times on one particular spot 
i asked whether i could ask what was going on 
 goddamn bed squeaks   he said  he stayed on his knees over the one particular spot  bearing down on it repeatedly  there
was now a squeaking sound from the mattress when he bore down on the spot  my father looked up and over at my mother next to
the bedroom window   do you or do you not hear that   he said  bearing down and letting up  my mother tapped her long cigarette
into a shallow ashtray she held in her other hand  she watched my father press down on the squeaking spot 
sweat was running in dark orange lines down my father s face from under his rigid white professional wig  my father served
for two years as the man from glad  representing what was then the glad flaccid plastic receptacle co  of zanesville  ohio  via a
california based advertising agency  the tunic  tight trousers  and boots the agency made him wear were also white 
my father pivoted on his knees and swung his body around and got off the mattress and put his hand at the small of his back
and straightened up  continuing to look at the mattress 
 this miserable cock sucking bed your mother felt she needed to hang on to and bring with us out here for quote sentimental
value has started squeaking   my father said  his saying  your mother  indicated that he was addressing himself to me  he held his
hand out for his tumbler of tomato juice without having to look at me  he stared darkly down at the bed   it s driving us fucking
nuts  
my mother balanced her cigarette in her shallow ashtray and laid the ashtray on the windowsill and bent over from the foot of
the bed and bore down on the spot my father had isolated  and it squeaked again 
 and at night this one spot here we ve isolated and identified seems to spread and metastisate until the whole goddamn bed s
replete with squeaks   he drank some of his tomato juice   areas that gibber and squeak   my father said   until we both feel as if
we re being eaten by rats   he felt along the line of his jaw   boiling hordes of gibbering squeaking ravenous rapacious rats   he
said  almost trembling with irritation 
i looked down at the mattress  at my mother s hands  which tended to flake in dry climates  she carried a small bottle of
moisturizing lotion at all times 
my father said   and i have personally had it with the aggravation   he blotted his forehead on his white sleeve 
i reminded my father that he d mentioned needing my help with something  at that age i was already taller than both my
parents  my mother was taller than my father  even in his boots  but much of her height was in her legs  my father s body was
denser and more substantial 
my mother came around to my father s side of the bed and picked the bedding up off the floor  she started folding the sheets
very precisely  using both arms and her chin  she stacked the folded bedding neatly on top of her dresser  which i remember was
white lacquer 
my father looked at me   what we need to do here  jim  is take the mattress and box spring off the bed frame under here   my
father said   and expose the frame   he took time out to explain that the bed s bottom mattress was hard framed and known
uniformly as a box spring  i was looking at my sneakers and making my feet alternately pigeon toed and then penguin toed on the
bedroom s blue carpet  my father drank some of his tomato juice and looked down at the edge of the bed s metal frame and felt
along the outline of his jaw  where his commercial studio makeup ended abruptly at the turtleneck collar of his white commercial
tunic 
 the frame on this bed is old   he told me   it s probably older than you are  right now i m thinking the thing s bolts have
maybe started coming loose  and that s what s gibbering and squeaking at night   he finished his tomato juice and held the glass
out for me to take and put somewhere   so we want to move all this top crap out of the way  entirely    he gestured with one arm

    entirely out of the way  get it out of the room  and expose the frame  and see if we don t maybe just need to tighten up the
bolts  
i wasn t sure where to put my father s empty glass  which had juice residue and grains of pepper along the inside s sides  i
poked at the mattress and box spring a little bit with my foot   are you sure it isn t just the mattress   i said  the bed s frame s bolts
struck me as a rather exotic first order explanation for the squeaking 
my father gestured broadly   synchronicity surrounds me  concord   he said   because that s what your mother thinks it is 
also   my mother was using both hands to take the blue pillowcases off all five of their pillows  again using her chin as a clamp 
the pillows were all the overplump polyester fiberfill kind  because of my father s allergies 
 great minds think alike   my father said 
neither of my parents had any interest in hard science  though a great uncle had accidentally electrocuted himself with a field
series generator he was seeking to patent 
my mother stacked the pillows on top of the neatly folded bedding on her dresser  she had to get up on her tiptoes to put the
folded pillowcases on top of the pillows  i had started to move to help her  but i couldn t decide where to put the empty tomato
juice glass 
 but you just want to hope it isn t the mattress   father said   or the box spring  
my mother sat down on the foot of the bed and got out another long cigarette and lit it  she carried a little leatherette snapcase for both her cigarettes and her lighter 
my father said   because a new frame  even if we can t get the bolts squared away on this one and i have to go get a new one 
a new frame  it wouldn t be too bad  see  even top shelf bed frames aren t that expensive  but new mattresses are outrageously
expensive   he looked at my mother   and i mean fucking outrageous   he looked down at the back of my mother s head   and we
bought a new box spring for this sad excuse for a bed not five years ago   he was looking down at the back of my mother s head as
if he wanted to confirm that she was listening  my mother had crossed her legs and was looking with a certain concentration either
at or out the master bedroom window  our home s whole subdivision was spread along a severe hillside  which meant that the
view from my parents  bedroom on the first floor was of just sky and sun and a foreshortened declivity of lawn  the lawn sloped
at an average angle of     and had to be mowed horizontally  none of the subdivision s lawns had trees yet   of course that was
during a seldom discussed point in time when your mother had to assume the burden of assuming responsibility for finances in the
household   my father said  he was now perspiring very heavily  but still had his white professional toupee on  and still looked at
my mother 
my father acted  throughout our time in california  as both symbol and spokesman for the glad f p r  co  s individual
sandwich bag division  he was the first of two actors to portray the man from glad  he was inserted several times a month in a
mock up of a car interior  where he would be filmed in a tight trans windshield shot receiving an emergency radio summons to
some household that was having a portable food storage problem  he was then inserted opposite an actress in a generic kitcheninterior set  where he would explain how a particular species of glad sandwich bag was precisely what the doctor ordered for the
particular portable food storage problem at issue  in his vaguely medical uniform of all white  he carried an air of authority and
great evident conviction  and earned what i always gathered was an impressive salary  for those times  and received  for the first
time in his career  fan mail  some of which bordered on the disturbing  and which he sometimes liked to read out loud at night in
the living room  loudly and dramatically  sitting up with a nightcap and fan mail long after my mother and i had gone to bed 
i asked whether i could excuse myself for a moment to take my father s empty tomato juice glass out to the kitchen sink  i
was worried that the residue along the inside sides of the tumbler would harden into the kind of precipitate that would be hard to
wash off 
 for christ s sake jim just put the thing down   my father said 
i put the tumbler down on the bedroom carpet over next to the base of my mother s dresser  pressing down to create a kind of
circular receptacle for it in the carpet  my mother stood up and went back over by the bedroom window with her ashtray  we
could tell she was getting out of our way 
my father cracked his knuckles and studied the path between the bed and the bedroom door 
i said i understood my part here to be to help my father move the mattress and box spring off the suspect bed frame and well
out of the way  my father cracked his knuckles and replied that i was becoming almost fright eningly quick and perceptive  he
went around between the foot of the bed and my mother at the window  he said   i want to let s just stack it all out in the hall  to
get it the hell out of here and give us some room to maneuver  
 right   i said 
my father and i were now on opposite sides of my parents  bed  my father rubbed his hands together and bent and worked his
hands between the mattress and box spring and began to lift the mattress up from his side of the bed  when his side of the mattress
had risen to the height of his shoulders  he somehow inverted his hands and began pushing his side up rather than lifting it  the
top of his wig disappeared behind the rising mattress  and his side rose in an arc to almost the height of the white ceiling  exceeded
     toppled over  and began to fall over down toward me  the mattress s overall movement was like the crest of a breaking wave 
i remember  i spread my arms and took the impact of the mattress with my chest and face  supporting the angled mattress with my
chest  outspread arms  and face  all i could see was an extreme close up of the woodland floral pattern of the mattress protector 
the mattress  a simmons beauty rest whose tag said that it could not by law be removed  now formed the hypotenuse of a
right dihedral triangle whose legs were myself and the bed s box spring  i remember visualizing and considering this triangle  my
legs were trembling under the mattress s canted weight  my father exhorted me to hold and support the mattress  the respectively
sharp plastic and meaty human smells of the mattress and protector were very distinct because my nose was mashed up against
them 
my father came around to my side of the bed  and together we pushed the mattress back up until it stood up at     again  we
edged carefully apart and each took one end of the upright mattress and began jockeying it off the bed and out the bedroom door
into the uncarpeted hallway 
this was a king size simmons beauty rest mattress  it was massive but had very little structural integrity  it kept curving

 and curling and wobbling  my father exhorted both me and the mattress  it was flaccid and floppy as we tried to jockey it  my
father had an especially hard time with his half of the mattress s upright weight because of an old competitive tennis injury 
while we were jockeying it on its side off the bed  part of the mattress on my father s end slipped and flopped over and down
onto a pair of steel reading lamps  adjustable cubes of brushed steel attached by toggle bolts to the white wall over the head of the
bed  the lamps took a solid hit from the mattress  and one cube was rotated all the way around on its toggle so that its open side
and bulb now pointed at the ceiling  the joint and toggle made a painful squeaking sound as the cube was wrenched around
upward  this was also when i became aware that even the reading lamps were on in the daylit room  because a faint square of
direct lamplight  its four sides rendered slightly concave by the distortion of projection  appeared on the white ceiling above the
skewed cube  but the lamps didn t fall off  they remained attached to the wall 
 god damn it to hell   my father said as he regained control of his end of the mattress 
my father also said   fucking son of a        when the mattress s thickness made it difficult for him to squeeze through the
doorway still holding his end 
in time we were able to get my parents  giant mattress out in the narrow hallway that ran between the master bedroom and the
kitchen  i could hear another terrible squeak from the bedroom as my mother tried to realign the reading lamp whose cube had
been inverted  drops of sweat were falling from my father s face onto his side of the mattress  darkening part of the protector s
fabric  my father and i tried to lean the mattress at a slight supporting angle against one wall of the hallway  but because the floor
of the hallway was uncarpeted and didn t provide sufficient resistance  the mattress wouldn t stay upright  its bottom edge slid out
from the wall all the way across the width of the hallway until it met the baseboard of the opposite wall  and the upright mattress s
top edge slid down the wall until the whole mattress sagged at an extremely concave slumped angle  a dry section of the woodland
floral mattress protector stretched drum tight over the slumped crease and the springs possibly damaged by the deforming concavity 
my father looked at the canted concave mattress sagging across the width of the hall and moved one end of it a little with the
toe of his boot and looked at me and said   fuck it  
my bow tie was rumpled and at an angle 
my father had to walk unsteadily across the mattress in his white boots to get back to my side of the mattress and the bedroom
behind me  on his way across he stopped and felt speculatively at his jaw  his boots sunk deep in woodland floral cotton  he said
 fuck it  again  and i remember not being clear about what he was referring to  then my father turned and started unsteadily back
the way he had come across the mattress  one hand against the wall for support  he instructed me to wait right there in the hallway
for one moment while he darted into the kitchen at the other end of the hall on a very brief errand  his steadying hand left four
faint smeared prints on the wall s white paint 
my parents  bed s box spring  though also king size and heavy  had just below its synthetic covering a wooden frame that
gave the box spring structural integrity  and it didn t flop or alter its shape  and after another bit of difficulty for my father   who
was too thick through the middle  even with the professional girdle beneath his glad costume   after another bit of difficulty for
my father squeezing with his end of the box spring through the bedroom doorway  we were able to get it into the hall and lean it
vertically at something just over     against the wall  where it stayed upright with no problem 
 that s the way she wants doing  jim   my father said  clapping me on the back in exactly the ebullient way that had prompted
me to have my mother buy an elastic athletic cranial strap for my glasses  i had told my mother i needed the strap for tennis
purposes  and she had not asked any questions 
my father s hand was still on my back as we returned to the master bedroom   right  then   my father said  his mood was now
elevated  there was a brief second of confusion at the doorway as each of us tried to step back to let the other through first 
there was now nothing but the suspect frame left where the bed had been  there was something exoskeletal and frail looking
about the bed frame  a plain low ratio rectangle of black steel  at each corner of the rectangle was a caster  the casters  wheels
had sunk into the pile carpet under the weight of the bed and my parents and were almost completely submerged in the carpet s
fibers  each of the frame s sides had a narrow steel shelf welded at     to its interior s base  so that a single rectangular narrow
shelf perpendicular to the frame s rectangle ran all around the frame s interior  this shelf was obviously there to support the bed s
occupants and king size box spring and mattress 
my father seemed frozen in place  i cannot remember what my mother was doing  there seemed to be a long silent interval of
my father looking closely at the exposed frame  the interval had the silence and stillness of dusty rooms immersed in sunlight  i
briefly imagined every piece of furniture in the bedroom covered with sheets and the room unoccupied for years as the sun rose
and crossed and fell outside the window  the room s daylight becoming staler and staler  i could hear two power lawnmowers of
slightly different pitch from somewhere down our subdivision s street  the direct light through the master bedroom s window
swam with rotating columns of raised dust  i remember it seemed the ideal moment for a sneeze 
dust lay thick on the frame and even hung from the frame s interior support shelf in little gray beards  it was impossible to
see any bolts anywhere on the frame 
my father blotted sweat and wet makeup from his forehead with the back of his sleeve  which was now dark orange with
makeup   jesus will you look at that mess   he said  he looked at my mother   jesus  
the carpeting in my parents  bedroom was deep pile and a darker blue than the pale blue of the rest of the bedroom s color
scheme  i remember the carpet as more a royal blue  with a saturation level somewhere between moderate and strong  the
rectangular expanse of royal blue carpet that had been hidden under the bed was itself carpeted with a thick layer of clotted dust 
the rectangle of dust was gray white and thick and unevenly layered  and the only evidence of the room s carpet below was a faint
sick bluish cast to the dust layer  it looked as if dust had not drifted under the bed and settled on the carpet inside the frame but
rather had somehow taken root and grown on it  upon it  the way a mold will take root and gradually cover an expanse of spoiled
food  the layer of dust itself looked a little like spoiled food  bad cottage cheese  it was nauseous  some of the dust layer s uneven
topography was caused by certain lost  and litter type objects that had found their way under the bed   a flyswatter  a roughly
variety sized magazine  some bottletops  three wadded kleenex  and what was probably a sock   and gotten covered and
textured in dust 

 there was also a faint odor  sour and fungal  like the smell of an overused bathmat 
 jesus  there s even a smell   my father said  he made a show of inhaling through his nose and screwing up his face   there s
even a fucking smell   he blotted his forehead and felt his jaw and looked hard at my mother  his mood was no longer elevated 
my father s mood surrounded him like a field and affected any room he occupied  like an odor or a certain cast to the light 
 when was the last time this got cleaned under here   my father asked my mother 
my mother didn t say anything  she looked at my father as he moved the steel frame around a little with his boot  which
raised even more dust into the window s sunlight  the bed frame seemed very lightweight  moving back and forth noiselessly on
its casters  submerged wheels  my father often moved lightweight objects absently around with his foot  rather the way other men
doodle or examine their cuticles  rugs  magazines  telephone and electrical cords  his own removed shoe  it was one of my
father s ways of musing or gathering his thoughts or trying to control his mood 
 under what presidential administration was this room last deep cleaned  i m standing here prompted to fucking muse out
loud   my father said 
i looked at my mother to see whether she was going to say anything in reply 
i said to my father   you know  since we re discussing squeaking beds  my bed squeaks  too  
my father was trying to squat down to see whether he could locate any bolts on the frame  saying something to himself under
his breath  he put his hands on the frame for balance and almost fell forward when the frame rolled under his weight 
 but i don t think i even really noticed it until we began to discuss it   i said  i looked at my mother   i don t think it bothers
me   i said   actually  i think i kind of like it  i think i ve gradually gotten so used to it that it s become almost comforting  at this
juncture   i said 
my mother looked at me 
 i m not complaining about it   i said  the discussion just made me think of it  
 oh  we hear your bed  don t you worry   my father said  he was still trying to squat  which drew his corset and the hem of his
tunic up and allowed the top of his bottom s crack to appear above the the waist of his white pants  he shifted slightly to point up
at the master bedroom s ceiling   you so much as turn over in bed up there  we hear it down here   he took one steel side of the
rectangle and shook the frame vigorously  sending up a shroud of dust  the bed frame seemed to weigh next to nothing under his
hands  my mother made a mustache of her finger to hold back a sneeze 
he shook the frame again   but it doesn t aggravate us the way this ro dential son of a whore right here does  
i remarked that i didn t think i d ever once heard their bed squeak before  from upstairs  my father twisted his head around to
try to look up at me as i stood there behind him  but i said i d definitely heard and could confirm the presence of a squeak when
he d pressed on the mattress  and could verify that the squeak was no one s imagination 
my father held a hand up to signal me to please stop talking  he remained in a squat  rocking slightly on the balls of his feet 
using the rolling frame to keep his balance  the flesh of the top of his bottom and crack area protruded over the waist of his pants 
there were also deep red folds in the back of his neck  below the blunt cut of the wig  because he was looking up and over at my
mother  who was resting her tail bone on the sill of the window  still holding her shallow ashtray 
 maybe you d like to go get the vacuum   he said  my mother put the ashtray down on the sill and exited the master bedroom 
passing between me and the dresser piled with bedding   if you can     if you can remember where it is   my father called after her 
i could hear my mother trying to get past the king size mattress sagging diagonally across the hall 
my father was rocking more violently on the balls of his feet  and now the rocking had the sort of rolling  side to side quality
of a ship in high seas  he came very close to losing his balance as he leaned to his right to get a handkerchief from his hip pocket
and began using it to reach out and flick dust off something at one corner of the bed frame  after a moment he pointed down next
to a caster 
 bolt   he said  pointing at the side of a caster   right there s a bolt   i leaned in over him  drops of my father s perspiration
made small dark coins in the dust of the frame  there was nothing but smooth lightweight black steel surface where he was
pointing  but just to the left of where he was pointing i could see what might have been a bolt  a little stalactite of clotted dust
hanging from some slight protrusion  my father s hands were broad and his fingers blunt  another possible bolt lay several inches
to the right of where he pointed  his finger trembled badly  and i believe the trembling might have been from the muscular strain
on his bad knees  trying to hold so much new weight in a squat for an extended period  i heard the telephone ring twice  there had
been an extended silence  with my father pointing at neither protrusion and me trying to lean in over him 
then  still squatting on the balls of his feet  my father placed both hands on the side of the frame and leaned out over the side
into the rectangle of dust inside the frame and had what at first sounded like a bad coughing fit  his hunched back and rising
bottom kept me from watching him  i remember deciding that the reason the frame was not rolling under his hands  pressure was
that my father had so much of his weight on it  and that maybe my father s nervous system s response to heavy dust was a coughsignal instead of a sneeze signal  it was the wet sound of material hitting the dust inside the rectangle  plus the rising odor  that
signified to me that  rather than coughing  my father had been taken ill  the spasms involved made his back rise and fall and his
bottom tremble under his white commercial slacks  it was not too uncommon for my father to be taken ill shortly after coming
home from work to relax  but now he seemed to have been taken really ill  to give him some privacy  i went around the frame to
the side of the frame closest to the window where there was direct light and less odor and examined another of the frame s casters 
my father was whispering to himself in brief expletive phrases between the spasms of his illness  i squatted easily and rubbed dust
from a small area of the frame and wiped the dust on the carpet by my feet  there was a small carriage head bolt on either side of
the plating that attached the caster to the bed frame  i knelt and felt one of the bolts  its round smooth head made it impossible
either to tighten or loosen  putting my cheek to the carpet and examining the bottom of the little horizontal shelf welded to the
frame s side  i observed that the bolt seemed threaded tightly and completely through its hole  and i decided it was doubtful that
any of the casters  platings  bolts were producing the sounds that reminded my father of rodents 
just at this time  i remember  there was a loud cracking sound and my area of the frame jumped violently as my father s
illness caused him to faint and he lost his balance and pitched forward and lay prone and asleep over his side of the bed frame 
which as i rolled away from the frame and rose to my knees i saw was either broken or very badly bent  my father lay facedown

 in the mixture of the rectangle s thick dust and the material he d brought up from his upset stomach  the dust his collapse raised
was very thick  and as the new dust rose and spread it attenuated the master bedroom s daylight as decisively as if a cloud had
moved over the sun in the window  my father s professional wig had detached and lay scalp up in the mixture of dust and stomach
material  the stomach material appeared to be mostly gastric blood until i recalled the tomato juice my father had been drinking 
he lay face down  with his bottom high in the air  over the side of the bed frame  which his weight had broken in half  this was
how i accounted for the loud cracking sound 
i stood out of the way of the dust and the window s dusty light  feeling along the line of my jaw and examining my prone
father from a distance  i remember that his breathing was regular and wet  and that the dust mixture bubbled somewhat  it was
then that it occurred to me that when i d been supporting the bed s raised mattress with my chest and face preparatory to its
removal from the room  the dihedral triangle i d imagined the mattress forming with the box spring and my body had not in fact
even been a closed figure  the box spring and the floor i had stood on did not constitute a continuous plane 
then i could hear my mother trying to get the heavy canister vacuum cleaner past the angled simmons beauty rest in the
hall  and i went to help her  my father s legs were stretched out across the clean blue carpet between his side of the frame and my
mother s white dresser  his feet s boots were at a pigeon toed angle  and his bottom s crack all the way down to the anus itself was
now visible because the force of his fall had pulled his white slacks down even farther  i stepped carefully between his legs 
 excuse me   i said 
i was able to help my mother by telling her to detach the vacuum cleaner s attachments and hand them one at a time to me
over the width of the slumped mattress  where i held them  the vacuum cleaner was manufactured by regina  and its canister 
which contained the engine  bag  and evacuating fan  was very heavy  i reassembled the vacuum and held it while my mother
made her way back across the mattress  then handed the vacuum cleaner back to her  flattening myself against the wall to let her
pass by on her way into the master bedroom 
 thanks   my mother said as she passed 
i stood there by the slumped mattress for several moments of a silence so complete that i could hear the street s lawnmowers
all the way out in the hall  then heard the sound of my mother pulling out the vacuum cleaner s retractable cord and plugging it
into the same bedside outlet the steel reading lamps were attached to 
i made my way over the angled mattress and quickly down the hall  made a sharp right at the entrance to the kitchen  crossed
the foyer to the staircase  and ran up to my room  taking several stairs at a time  hurrying to get some distance between myself and
the vacuum cleaner  because the sound of vacuuming has always frightened me in the same irrational way it seemed a bed s
squeak frightened my father 
i ran upstairs and pivoted left at the upstairs landing and went into my room  in my room was my bed  it was narrow  a twin
bed  with a headboard of wood and frame and slats of wood  i didn t know where it had come from  originally  the frame held the
narrow box spring and mattress much higher off the floor than my parents  bed  it was an old fashioned bed  so high off the floor
that you had to put one knee up on the mattress and clamber up into it  or else jump 
that is what i did  for the first time since i had become taller than my parents  i took several running strides in from the
doorway  past my shelves  collection of prisms and lenses and tennis trophies and my scale model magneto  past my bookcase  the
wall s still posters from powell s peeping tom and the closet door and my bedside s high intensity standing lamp  and jumped 
doing a full swan dive up onto my bed  i landed with my weight on my chest with my arms and legs out from my body on the
indigo comforter on my bed  squashing my tie and bending my glasses  temples slightly  i was trying to make my bed produce a
loud squeak  which in the case of my bed i knew was caused by any lateral friction between the wooden slats and the frame s
interior s shelf like slat support 
but in the course of the leap and the dive  my overlong arm hit the heavy iron pole of the high intensity standing lamp that
stood next to the bed  the lamp teetered violently and began to fall over sideways  away from the bed  it fell with a kind of
majestic slowness  resembling a felled tree  as the lamp fell  its heavy iron pole struck the brass knob on the door to my closet 
shearing the knob off completely  the round knob and half its interior hex bolt fell off and hit my room s wooden floor with a loud
noise and began then to roll around in a remarkable way  the sheared end of the hex bolt stationary and the round knob  rolling on
its circumference  circling it in a spherical orbit  describing two perfectly circular motions on two distinct axes  a non euclidian
figure on a planar surface  i e   a cycloid on a sphere 
x v

x y
the closest conventional analogue i could derive for this figure was a cycloid  l hopital s solution to bernoulli s famous
brachistochrone problem  the curve traced by a fixed point on the circumference of a circle rolling along a continuous plane  but
since here  on the bedroom s floor  a circle was rolling around what was itself the circumference of a circle  the cycloid s standard
parametric equations were no longer apposite  those equations  trigonometric expressions here becoming themselves first order
differential equations 

 because of the lack of resistance or friction against the bare floor  the knob rolled this way for a long time as i watched over
the edge of the comforter and mattress  holding my glasses in place  completely distracted from the minor d shriek of the vacuum
below  it occurred to me that the movement of the amputated knob perfectly schematized what it would look like for someone to
try to turn somersaults with one hand nailed to the floor  this was how i first became interested in the possibilities of annula tion 
the night after the chilly and sort of awkward joint interdependence day picnic for enfield s ennet house drug and alcohol
recovery house  somer ville s phoenix house  and dorchester s grim new choice juvenile rehab  ennet house staffer johnette
foltz took ken erdedy and kate gompert along with her to this one na beginners  discussion meeting where the focus was
always marijuana  how every addict at the meeting had gotten in terrible addictive trouble with it right from the first dubois  or
else how they d been strung out on harder drugs and had tried switching to grass to get off the original drugs and but then had
gotten in even terribler trouble with grass than they d been in with the original hard stuff  this was supposedly the only na
meeting in metro boston explicitly devoted to marijuana  johnette foltz said she wanted erdedy and gompert to see how
completely nonunique and unalone they were in terms of the substance that had brought them both down 
there were about maybe two dozen beginning recovering addicts there in the anechoic vestry of an upscale church in what
erdedy figured had to be either west belmont or east waltham  the chairs were arranged in na s traditional huge circle  with no
tables to sit at and everybody balancing ashtrays on their knees and accidentally kicking over their cups of coffee  everybody who
raised their hand to share concurred on the insidious ways marijuana had ravaged their bodies  minds  and spirits  marijuana
destroys slowly but thoroughly was the consensus  ken erdedy s joggling foot knocked over his coffee not once but twice as the
nas took turns concurring on the hideous psychic fallout they d all endured both in active marijuana dependency and then in
marijuana detox  the social isolation  anxious lassitude  and the hyperself consciousness that then reinforced the withdrawal and
anxiety   the increasing emotional abstraction  poverty of affect  and then total emotional catalepsy   the obsessive analyzing 
finally the paralytic stasis that results from the obsessive analysis of all possible implications of both getting up from the couch
and not getting up from the couch   and then the endless symptomatic gauntlet of withdrawal from delta  tetrahydrocannabinol  i e  pot detox  the loss of appetite  the mania and insomnia  the chronic fatigue and nightmares  the
impotence and cessation of menses and lactation  the circadian arrhythmia  the sudden sauna type sweats and mental confusion
and fine motor tremors  the particularly nasty excess production of saliva   several beginners still holding institutional droolcups just under their chins   the generalized anxiety and foreboding and dread  and the shame of feeling like neither m d s nor
the hard drug nas themselves showed much empathy or compassion for the  addict  brought down by what was supposed to be
nature s humblest buzz  the benignest substance around 
ken erdedy noticed that nobody came right out and used the terms melancholy or anhedonia or depression  much less clinical
depression  but this worst of symptoms  this logarithm of all suffering  seemed  though unmen tioned  to hang fog like just over
the room s heads  to drift between the peristyle columns and over the decorative astrolabes and candles on long prickets and
medieval knockoffs and framed knights of columbus charters  a gassy plasm so dreaded no beginner could bear to look up and
name it  kate gompert kept staring at the floor and making a revolver of her forefinger and thumb and shooting herself in the
temple and then blowing pretend cordite off the barrel s tip until johnette foltz whispered to her to knock it off 
as was his custom at meetings  ken erdedy said nothing and observed everybody else very closely  cracking his knuckles
and joggling his foot  since an na  beginner  is technically anybody with under a year clean  there were varying degrees of denial
and distress and general cluelessness in this plush upscale vestry  the meeting had the usual broad demographic cross section  but
the bulk of these grass ravaged people looked to him urban and tough and busted up and dressed without any color sense at all 
people you could easily imagine smacking their kid in a supermarket or lurking with a homemade sap in the dark of a downtown
alley  same as aa  motley disre spectability was like the room norm  along with glazed eyes and excess spittle  a couple of the
beginners still had the milky plastic i d  bracelets from psych wards they d forgotten to cut off  or else hadn t yet gotten up the
drive to do it 
unlike boston aa  boston na has no mid meeting raffle break and goes for just an hour  at the close of this monday
beginners  meeting everybody got up and held hands in a circle and recited the na conference approved  just for today   then
they all recited the our father  not exactly in unison  kate gompert later swore she distinctly heard the tattered older man beside
her say  and lead us not into penn station  during the our father 
then  just as in aa  the na meeting closed with everybody shouting to the air in front of them to keep coming back
because it works 
but then  kind of horrifically  everyone in the room started milling around wildly and hugging each other  it was like
somebody d thrown a switch  there wasn t even very much conversation  it was just hugging  as far as erdedy could see 
rampant  indiscriminate hugging  where the point seemed to be to hug as many people as possible regardless of whether you d
ever seen them before in your life  people went from person to person  arms out and leaning in  big people stooped and short
people got up on tiptoe  jowls ground into other jowls  both genders hugged both genders  and the male to male hugs were
straight embraces  hugs minus the vigorous little thumps on the back that erdedy d always seen as somehow requisite for male tomale hugs  johnette foltz was almost a blur  she went from person to person  she was racking up serious numbers of hugs  kate
gompert had her usual lipless expression of morose distaste  but even she gave and got some hugs  but erdedy   who d never
particularly liked hugging   moved way back from the throng  over up next to the na conference approved literature table 
and stood there by himself with his hands in his pockets  pretending to study the coffee urn with great interest 
but then a tall heavy afro american fellow with a gold incisor and perfect vertical cylinder of afro american hairstyle
peeled away from a sort of group hug nearby  he d spotted erdedy  and the fellow came over and established himself right in front
of erdedy  spreading the arms of his fatigue jacket for a hug  stooping slightly and leaning in toward erdedy s personal trunkregion 
erdedy raised his hands in a benign no thanks and backed up further so that his bottom was squashed up against the edge of
the conference approved literature table 
 thanks  but i don t particularly like to hug   he said 
the fellow had to sort of pull up out of his pre hug lean  and stood there awkwardly frozen  with his big arms still out  which

 erdedy could see must have been awkward and embarrassing for the fellow  erdedy found himself trying to calculate just what
remote sub asian locale would be the maximum possible number of km  away from this exact spot and moment as the fellow just
stood there  his arms out and the smile draining from his face 
 say what   the fellow said 
erdedy proffered a hand   ken e   ennet house  enfield  how do you do  you are  
the fellow slowly let his arms down but just looked at erdedy s proffered hand  a single styptic blink   roy tony   he said 
 roy  how do you do  
 what it is   roy said  the big fellow now had his handshake hand behind his neck and was pretending to feel the back of his
neck  which erdedy didn t know was a blatant dis 
 well roy  if i may call you roy  or mr  tony  if you prefer  unless it s a compound first name  hyphenated   roy tony  and
then a last name  but well with respect to this hugging thing  roy  it s nothing personal  rest assured  
 assured  
erdedy s best helpless smile and an apologetic shrug of the goretex anorak   i m afraid i just don t particularly like to hug 
just not a hugger  never have been  it was something of a joke among my fam  
now the ominous finger pointing of street aggression  this roy fellow pointing first at erdedy s chest and then at his own   so
man what you say you saying i m a hugger  you saying you think i go around like to hug  
both erdedy s hands were now up palms out and waggling in a like bon hommic gesture of heading off all possible
misunderstanding   no but see the whole point is that i wouldn t presume to call you either a hugger or a nonhugger because i
don t know you  i only meant to say it s nothing personal having to do with you as an individual  and i d be more than happy to
shake hands  even one of those intricate multiple handed ethnic handshakes if you ll bear with my inexperience with that sort of
handshake  but i m simply uncomfortable with the whole idea of hugging  
by the time johnette foltz could break away and get over to them  the fellow had erdedy by his anorak s insulated lapels and
was leaning him way back over the edge of the literature table so that erdedy s waterproof lodge boots were off the ground  and
the fellow s face was right up in erdedy s face in a show of naked aggression 
 you think i fucking like to go around hug on folks  you think any of us like this shit  we fucking do what they tell us  they
tell us hugs not drugs in here  we done motherfucking surrendered our wills in here   roy said   you little faggot   roy added  he
wedged his hand between them to point at himself  which meant he was now holding erdedy off the ground with just one hand 
which fact was not lost on erdedy s nervous system   i done had to give four hugs my first night here and then i gone ran in the
fucking can and fucking puked  puked   he said   not comfortable  who the fuck are you  don t even try and tell me i m coming
over feeling comfortable about trying to hug on your james river traders wearing calvin klein aftershave smelling goofy ass
motherfucking ass  
erdedy observed one of the afro american women who was looking on clap her hands and shout  talk about it  
 and now you go and disrespect me in front of my whole clean and sober set just when i gone risk sharing my vulnerability
and discomfort with you  
johnette foltz was sort of pawing at the back of roy tony s fatigue jacket  shuddering mentally at how the report of an ennet
house resident assaulted at an na meeting she d personally brought him to would look written up in the staff log 
 now   roy said  extracting his free hand and pointing to the vestry floor with a stabbing gesture   now   he said   you gone risk
vulnerability and discomfort and hug my ass or do i gone fucking rip your head off and shit down your neck  
johnette foltz had hold of the roy fellow s coat now with both hands and was trying to pull the fellow off  keds scrabbling
for purchase on the smooth parquet  saying  yo roy t  man  easy there dude  man  esse  bro  posse  crew  homes  jim  brother 
he s just new is all   but by this time erdedy had both arms around the guy s neck and was hugging him with such vigor kate
gompert later told joelle van dyne it looked like erdedy was trying to climb him

   november year of the depend adult undergarment
the following things in the room were blue  the blue checks in the blue and black checked shag carpet  two of the room s
six institutional plush chairs  whose legs were steel tubes bent into big ellipses  which wobbled  so that while the chairs couldn t
really be rocked in they could be sort of bobbed in  which michael pemulis was doing absently as he waited and scanned a
printout of eschaton s highly technical core eschax directory  i e  bobbing in his chair  which produced a kind of rapid rodential
squeaking that gave hal incandenza the howling fantods as he sat there kitty corner from pemulis  also waiting  the printout kept
rotating in pemulis s hands  each chair had a     watt reading lamp attached to the back on a flexible metal stalk that let the
reading lamp curve out from behind and shine right down on whatever magazine the waiting person was looking at  but since the
curved lamps induced this unbearable sensation of somebody feverish right there reading over your shoulder  the magazines  some
of whose covers involved the color blue  tended to stay unread  and were fanned neatly out on a low ceramic coffeetable  the
carpet was a product of something called antron  hal could see streaks of lividity where some body d vacuumed against the grain 
though the magazines  coffeetable was nonblue   a wet nail polish red with e t a  in a kind of gray escutcheon   two of
the unsettlingly attached lamps that kept its magazines unread and neatly fanned were blue  although the two blue lamps were not
the lamps attached to the two blue chairs  dr  charles tavis liked to say that you could tell a lot about an administrator by the
decor of his waiting room  the headmaster s waiting room was part of a little hallway in the comm  ad  lobby s southwest
corner  the premie violets in an asymmetrical sprig in a tennis ball shaped vase on the coffee table were arguably in the blue
family  and also the overenhanced blue of the wallpaper s sky  which the wallpaper scheme was fluffy cumuli arrayed
patternlessly against an overenhancedly blue sky  incredibly disorienting wallpaper that was by an unpleasant coincidence also the
wallpaper in the enfield offices of a dr  zegarelli  d d s   which hal s just come back from  after a removal  the left side of his
face still feels big and dead  with this persistent sensation that he s drooling without being able to feel it or stop it  no one s sure
what c t  s choice of this wallpaper is supposed to communicate  especially to parents who come with prospective kids in tow to
scout out e t a   but hal loathes sky and cloud wallpaper because it makes him feel high altitude and disoriented and sometimes
plummeting 
the sills and crosspieces of the waiting room s two windows have always been dark blue  there was a nautical blue border of
braid around the bill of michael pemulis s jaunty yachting cap  hal was confident pemulis would remove the insouciant hat the
minute they were called in on what was presumably going to be the carpet 
also blue  the upper border slices of sky in the framed informal photos of e t a  students that hung on the walls        the
chassis of alice moore s intel     word processor w  modem but no cartridge capability  also ms  moore s fingertips and lips  the
e t a  headmaster s receptionist and administrative assistant is known to the players as lateral alice moore  in her youth lateral
alice moore had been a helicopter pilot and airborne traffic reporter for a major boston radio station until a tragic collision with
another station s airborne traffic report helicopter   plus then the cataclysmic fall to the rush hour s jamaica way six laner below
  had left her with chronic oxygen debt and a neurological condition whereby she was able to move only from side to side  so
hence the sobriquet lateral alice moore  an effective time killer while sitting there waiting for whatever administrator s
summoned you is to have lateral alice moore drum rapidly on her chest and give imitations of her old boston rush hour traffic
reports in a stuttered helicopterish reporter voice  neither hal  continually checking his chin for drool  nor pemulis  scanning and
bobbing  nor ann kittenplan nor trevor axford   about whom there was today not even a hint of the color blue   are in the
mood for this right now  awaiting what they presume to be some kind of administrative fallout from sunday s horrendous
eschaton fiasco  the presumption is based on who s been summoned here  to wait 
the two different sized offices that open off the waiting room  through the open and only other door of which the dusky blue
mannington shag of the comm  ad  lobby is visible  belong to dr  charles tavis and to mrs  avril incandenza  tavis s office s
outer door is real oak and has his name and degree and title in  nonblue  letters so big that the total i d  crowds the door s margins 
there s also an inner door 
avril  whose feelings about enclosure are well known  has no door on her office  her office is bigger than c t  s  though  and

 has a seminar table it s always been obvious he covets  avril s office s blue and black checkered shag is deeper than the waiting
room s shag  so that the border between the two is like a mowed v  unmowed lawn  avril serves  pro bono  as e t a  s dean of
academic affairs and dean of females  she s in there unenclosed right now with pretty much every e t a  female under thirteen
except ann kittenplan  whose tattooed knuckles are bruised and who looks somehow cross dressed in a dress and  nonblue 
barrette  avril has vividly white hair   as of the last few months before himself s felo de se   that looks like it never went
through the gray stage  it mostly didn t  and legs whose taper you can see t  axford is appraising with the frankness of
adolescence as she paces a bit in front of the crowded seminar table  in full if kind of oblique angled view of the people in the
waiting room        though it s not technically in the waiting room with hal  the plastic fine tip felt pen avril taps
professionally against her incisors as she paces and considers is  blue 
administrative diddle checks have been required at all north american tennis academies since the infamous case of coach r 
bill   touchy   phiely at california s rolling hills academy  whose hair raising diary and collection of telephotos and tiny panties
  discovered only after his disappearance into the humboldt county hill country with a thirteen year old companion   created
what might be conservatively termed a climate of concern among the continent s tennis parents  at the enfield tennis academy 
for the last four years  dr  dolores rusk is supposed to hold a kind of distaff community meeting with all female players judged
naive and mop petish enough to be potential diddlees   the youngest of these is rhode island s pint sized tina echt  just seven
but a true cannibal off the backhand side   to interface in a discreet but nurturingly empowering group setting  etc   and nip any
potential phielyisms in the bud  monthly diddle checks are in rusk s contract because they re in e t a  s o n a n t a 
accreditation charter 
dean of females avril m  incandenza presides over the diddle check when dr  rusk is otherwise engaged  and rusk is so
very rarely legitimately engaged that the fact that it s the moms doing diddle prevention duty today leads hal to fear that rusk is
maybe in there in the headmaster s office getting ready to be in on the upcoming disciplinary scene  c t  would have to be really
upset to want to have rusk included  rusk might be there more for c t  than for any studential psyches 
axhandle has his eyes closed and is repeating a mnemonic limerick about brewster s angle for the leith taught quadrivial
colloquium  reflections on refraction   michael pemulis is still scanning a serrated scroll of endstat axiomatic pink   which
looks to be all math and spiky brackets  and bobbing  ignoring ann kittenplan s murderous looks and tubercular throat clearings
at the squeaking of his bobbing blue chair  you can tell pemulis really is studying because he keeps turning something upsidedown and then rightside up  hal declines to share his rusk being in there with tavis worries with michael pemulis  not just
because hal avoids ever mentioning rusk s name but also because pemulis loathes rusk with a hard and gem like flame  and
though he d never admit it is already clearly nauseated with worry that he s going to get the lion s share of the blame for damage to
lord and possalthwaite and not only receive corrective on court discipline but maybe get denied a spot on the trip to tucson s
whataburger  or worse       
avril is indirect but syntactically crisp with the couple dozen little girls in there  probing  the girls  outfits involve blue at
many levels of hue and intensity in varied combination  avril incandenza s voice is higher on the register than one would expect
from a woman so imposingly tall  it is high and sort of airy  oddly insubstantial  is the e t a  consensus  orin says one reason
avril dislikes music is that whenever she hums along she sounds insane 
the absence of a door to the moms s office means you might as well be in there  in terms of being able to hear what s going
on  she has little sense of spatial privacy or boundary  having been so much alone so much when a child  lateral alice moore
wears a sort of surreal combination of black lycra spandex and filmy green tulle  the portable stereo headphones she wears  
entering what appear to be response macros for     received invitations to next week s whataburger invitational   are powderblue  her typing is clearly in synch with something s backbeat  her lips and cheek points are the vague robin s egg of cyanosis 
just why michael pemulis hates dr  rusk is unclear and seems free floating  hal gets a different answer from pemulis every
time  hal himself feels uncomfortable around dolores rusk and avoids her but isn t aware of any particular reason for being
uncomfortable around her  but pemulis positively detests rusk  it was pemulis who d dickied in at night and hooked a delco
battery up to the inside brass knob of her locked office door  at age fifteen  rusk s office door  the first door over in the other little
hallway at the lobby s ne corner  next to the shift nurses  office and infirmary  then exiting rusk s office by a window and thorny
hedge  which pemulis was extremely fortunate no one but hal and schacht and maybe mario knew he authored the hot knob 
because the whole scheme turned quickly disastrous  because it was an elderly brighton irish cleaning lady who got to the hot
knob first  at like     h   and it turned out pemulis had seriously under calculated the brass conducted delco voltage involved 
and if the cleaning lady hadn t been wearing yellow rubber cleaning lady gloves she would have ended up with way worse than
the permanent perm and irreversible crossed eyes she regained consciousness with  and the cleaning lady s ward boss was upper
brighton s infamous f  x    follow that ambulance   byrne  rapacious personal injury j d   and the academy s workman s
comp  premiums had skyrocketed  and the whole thing was still in litigation 
avril had eschewed an office door even before the cleaning lady kert wang  for simple enclosure reasons 
recrossed legs and closer inspection reveal that trevor axford s left sock  though not his right sock  is blue 
sinistral  his right hand missing digits from a fireworks accident three interdependence days past  axhandle is several cm 
shorter than hal incan denza and is a true redheaded person  with copper colored hair and that moist white freckle chocked skin
that even through two layers of summer pledge only reddens and peels  plus there s the matter of the enormous and forever
chapped lips  and as a tennis player he is like a less effective version of john wayne   he does nothing but blast from the
baseline  w o discernible spin  he s a junior from short beach ct and under enormous family pressure to continue the male
axford tradition of attending yale and is academically so marginal that he knows his only chance to go to yale is to play tennis
for yale  which would effectively blow any chance at a show level future  and is high ranked but has set his competitive sights on
nothing past a ride offer to yale  though ingersoll s informally in hal s big buddy contingent  he s technically in axhandle s 
they re both aware  and hal s a little uncomfortable about his relief that none of the real eschaton casualties were technically his
buddies        the only real thing axford and hal have in common on the court is a curious habit of refusing to ask for help
from other courts when their balls go astray       
pemulis has finally quit with the bobbing and folded the printout scroll of pink  into a big ragged square and has sidled over

 to lateral alice moore s horseshoe shaped desk and is bantering with her very casually  looking all around him as he banters 
trying subtly to feel her out re whether maybe one of these whataburger jr  invitational invitations stacked cruciform  female
athwart male  in lateral alice s in box concerns anybody with the male initials m m p   by any chance  pemulis and moore
would be less tight if she knew he dickied in at night and used her wats and modem  though she s very laid back and easygoing
and not at all like the little framed thing by her name plaque with a scowling woman saying i ve got one nerve left and
you re getting on it  the little cartoon is just a standard like office worker gag  she d summoned them out of sixth hour
with the same ancient intercom and mike system troeltsch et al  get to commandeer for saturdays  weta  troeltsch has had to
be prohibited from playing with her chair   and her transmitted voice had not been ungentle  hal s face s left side feels queerly
inflated  but then when he runs his right hand over it it s always regulation size  administrative assistants worth their health
benefits are synaptically evolved to the point where they can banter  accept compliments on a spandex and tulle ensemble 
effortlessly deflect unauthorized info probes  listen to something bass intensive on personal stereo headphones  and word process
effortlessly to the headphones  backbeat  all simultaneously  lateral alice moore s bluish fingertips make her painted nails ten
little sunsets  lateral alice moore s desk s chair s wheels fit on a track with an electrified third rail  so she can slide from one
corner of the horseshoe s arc to the other   more or less laterally   at the touch of a cerise desktop button  for post delcoincident legal reasons  the name plaque on her reception desk has danger  third rail instead of the name lateral alice
moore 
hal can hear avril saying  now  if i speak to all of you very gently about being touched by a tall person in an uncomfortable
way  will you know what i mean  have any of you been kissed or nuzzled or hugged or rubbed or pinched or probed or fondled or
in any way touched by a tall person in a way that s made you uncomfortable   hal can see one of his moms s stockinged legs 
terminating in a trim ankle and a very white reebok  extruding from stage right into the frame of the empty doorway  the reebok
tapping patiently  and one arm crossed over avril s chest  and the other arm s elbow resting on that arm and fluttering in and out of
view as avril taps at her teeth with a blue pen 
 gramma pinches my cheek   one girl volunteers  she d actually raised her hand to be called on  her wrist with its touching
little  blue  terry wristband  hal hasn t seen so many pigtails and button noses and small berry shaped mouths convened in one
indoor place in who knows how long  very few of the sneakered feet reach all the way to the thick shag in there  much legdangling and absent uncomfortable sneaker swinging  a couple fingers in nostrils in absent contemplation  ann kittenplan  in her
blue chair  is coolly appraising the little wash offable tattoos she applies daily to the knuckles of her hands 
 not quite what we re trying to speak of together right now  erica   from someplace above the tapping foot and in and out arm 
hal knows the register and inflections of his mother s voice so well it almost makes him uncomfortable  his left ankle gives a sick
squeak when he flexes it  cords in his left forearm stand out and subside as he squeezes his tennis ball  the left side of his face
feels like something far away that means him harm and is coming gradually closer  he can make out just the whistly fricatives of
charles tavis s distant voice from behind his double office doors  it sounds somehow like he s speaking to more than one person
in there  charles tavis s office s inner door also has the i d  dr  charles tavis on it  and below that his e t a  motto about
the man who knows his limitations having none 
 she does it really hard   rebuts what must be erica siress 
 i ve seen her do it   what sounds like jolene criess confirms 
another   i hate that  
 i hate it when some adult pats my head like i m a schnauzer  
 the next adult that calls me adorable is in for a really unpleasant surprise let me tell you  
 i hate it when my hair is tousled or smoothed in any way  
 kittenplan s tall  kittenplan gives indian rub burns after lights out  
avril gives them verbal space  tries gently to steer the topic closer to true phielyism  she s subtle and very good with small
children 
       that my daddy gives me these small little shoves in the small of the back when he wants me to go into rooms  it s like he
influences me into rooms from behind  this tiny little irritating push  that makes me want to let him have it in the shin  
 mmmmmm hmm   avril muses 
it s impossible not to overhear  because things out in the waiting room right now are so comparatively silent except for the
tinny hiss of lateral alice moore s disengaged headphones and the conspiratorial murmur of michael pemulis trying to get her to
drum on her chest and describe      south s neponset exit ramp as one very long thin parking lot  things are so quiet because the
anxiety level in tavis s waiting room is high 
 you re all in for some serious pukers is my prediction   ann kittenplan had said to pemulis as they all first answered the
intercom s summons  which was also about the time that pemulis started in with the rodential chair squeaking that made one half
of kittenplan s face spasm 
one of the tricky and sinister things about corrective discipline at a tennis academy is that punishments can take the form of
what might look like straight out athletic conditioning  q v  the drill sergeant telling the recruit to drop and give him fifty  etc  so
but this is why gerhardt schtitt and his prorectors are way more feared than ogilvie or richardson levy o byrne chawaf or any
of the regular academics  it s not just that schtitt s corporal reputation preceded him here  it s that schtitt and delint make out the
daily schedules for a m  drills and p m  matches and resistance training and conditioning runs  but especially the a m  drills 
certain drills are well known to be nothing more than attitude adjusters  designed to do nothing but dramatically lower life quality
for a few minutes  too brutal to be assigned on the daily basis that would contribute to genuine aerobic conditioning  drills like
the disciplinary version of tap   whack       are known to the kids simply as pukers  puker drills are really meant to do
nothing but hurt you and make you think long and hard before repeating whatever you did to merit them  but they re still to all
outward appearances exempt from any kind of viii amendment protest or sniveling calls home to parents  insidiously  since they
can be described to parents and police       alike as just drills assigned for your overall cardiovascular benefit  with all the
actual sadism completely sub rosa 
kittenplan s prediction that the upperclassmen are going to wear the whole brown helmet for the eschaton free for all is

 hopefully rebuttable by pemulis s observation that eschaton s extracurricular impulse and structure had been firmly in place before
any of them d even enrolled  all michael pemulis had done was codify basic principles and impose a sort of matrix of decidable
strategy  maybe helped create a mythology and established  mostly through personal example  a certain level of expectation  all
hal d done was act as amanuensis on a lousy manual  the i  day combatants had been out there of their own volition  pemulis
and axford d gotten hal to write out most of all this in maximally rhetorical diction  which pemulis had then embedded in a pink 
printout so he could carry it around and study it and have it all nailed down before tavis tried any boom lowering  the strategy is
to let pemulis do all the talking but let hal interject at will  the voice of reason  good cop bad  axford s been instructed to count
the an tron fibers between his shoes the whole time they re in there 
hal has no idea what it might signify that the headmaster s summons hasn t come for almost    hours  it might be odd that it
hadn t once occurred to him to see tavis personally  or to go to hmh and ask the moms for intercession or info  it s not like he
had the urge but resisted it  it hadn t even occurred to him 
for somebody who not only lives on the same institutional grounds as his family but also has his training and education and
pretty much his whole overall raison d etre directly overseen by relatives  hal devotes an unusually small part of his brain and
time ever thinking about people in his family qua family members  sometimes when he ll be chatting with somebody in the
endless registration line for a tournament or at a post meet dance or something and somebody ll say something like  how s avril
getting along   or  i saw orin kicking the everliving shit out of the ball on an o n a n f l  highlights cartridge last week   there
will be this odd tense moment where hal s mind will go utterly blank and his mouth slack and flabby  working soundlessly  as if
the names were words on the tip of his tongue  except for mario  about whom hal will talk your ear off  it s almost like some ponderous creaky machine has to get up and running for hal even to think about members of his immediate family as standing in
relation to himself  it s a possible reason hal avoids dr  dolores rusk  who always wants to probe him on issues of space and selfdefinition and something she keeps calling the  coatlicue complex        
hal s maternal half uncle charles tavis is a little like the late himself in that tavis s c v  is a back and forth but not
indecisive mix of athletics and hard science  a b a  and doctorate in engineering  an m b a  in athletics administration   in his
professional youth tavis had put them together as a civil engineer  his specialty the accommodation of stress through patterned
dispersal  i e  distributing the weight of gargantuan athletic spectatorial crowds  i e   he d say  he d handled large live audiences 
he d been in his own small way a minor pioneer in polymer reinforced cement and mobile fulcra  he d been on design teams for
stadia and civic centers and grandstands and micological looking superdomes  he d admit up front that he d been a far better
team player engineer than out there up front stage center in the architectural limelight  he d apologize profusely when you had no
idea what that sentence meant and say maybe the obfuscation had been unconsciously deliberate  out of some kind of
embarrassment over his first and last limelighted architectural supervision  up in ontario  before the rise of o n a n ite
interdependence  when he d designed the toronto blue jays  novel and much ballyhooed skydome ballpark and hotel complex 
because tavis had been the one to take the lion s share of the heat when it turned out that blue jays  spectators in the stands  many
of them innocent children wearing caps and pounding their little fists into the gloves they d brought with hopes of nothing more
exotic than a speared foul ball  that spectators at a distressing number of different points all along both foul lines could see right
into the windows of guests having various and sometimes exotic sex in the hotel bedrooms over the center field wall  the bulk of
the call for tavis s rolling head had come  he d tell you  when the cameraman in charge of the skydome s instant replay video
scoreboard  disgruntled or professionally suicidal or both  started training his camera on the bedroom windows and routing the
resultant multi limbed coital images up onto the    meter scoreboard screen  etc  sometimes in slow motion and with multiple
replays  etc  tavis will admit his reluctance to talk about it  still  after all this time  he ll confess that his usual former careersummary is to say just that he d specialized in athletic venues that could safely and comfortably seat enormous numbers of live
spectators  and that the market for his services had bottomed out as more and more events were designed for cartridgedissemination and private home viewing  which he ll point out is not technically untrue so much as just not entirely open and
forthcoming 
lateral alice moore is printing out whataburger rsvps  the intel     is cutting edge  but she clings to a hideous old dotmatrix printer she refuses to replace as long as dave harde can keep it going  it s the same with the intercom system and its
antiquated iron stand up mike that troeltsch says is an affront to the whole broadcasting profession  lateral alice has queer
eccentric pockets of intransigence and ludditism  due possibly to her helicopter crash and neurologic deficits  the printer s needly
sound fills the waiting room  hal finds he can be confident of his face s symmetry and saliva only when he sits there with his right
hand over his left cheek  each line of alice s printed response sounds like some sort of supposedly unrippa ble fabric getting
ripped  over and over  a dental and life denying sound 
for hal  the general deal with his maternal uncle is that tavis is terribly shy around people and tries to hide it by being very
open and expansive and wordy and bluff  and that it s excruciating to be around  mario s way of looking at it is that tavis is very
open and expansive and wordy  but so clearly uses these qualities as a kind of protective shield that it betrays a frightened
vulnerability almost impossible not to feel for  either way  the unsettling thing about charles tavis is that he s possibly the
openest man of all time  orin and marlon bain s view was always that c t  was less like a person than like a sort of cross section
of a person  even the moms hal could remember relating anecdotes about how as a teenager  when she d taken the child c t  or
been around him at quebecois functions or gatherings involving other kids  the child c t  had been too self conscious and
awkward to join right in with any group of the kids clustered around  talking or plotting or whatever  and so avril said she d watch
him just kind of drift from cluster to cluster and lurk around creepily on the fringe  listening  but that he d always say  loudly  in
some lull in the group s conversation  something like  i m afraid i m far too self conscious really to join in here  so i m just going
to lurk creepily at the fringe and listen  if that s all right  just so you know   and so on 
but so the point is that tavis is an odd and delicate specimen  both ineffectual and in certain ways fearsome as a headmaster 
and being a relative guarantees no special predictive insight or quarter  unless certain maternal connections are exploited  the
thought of doing which literally does not occur to hal  this odd blankness about his family might be one way to manage a life
where domestic and vocational authorities sort of bleed into each other  hal squeezes his tennis ball like a madman  sitting there in
the needly printout noise  right palm against his left cheek and elbow hiding his mouth  wanting very much to go first to the pump

 room and then to brush vigorously with his portable collapsible oral b  a quick chew of kodiak is out of the question for several
reasons 
the only other time this year that hal was officially summoned to the headmaster s waiting room had been in late august 
right before convocation and during orientation period  when y d a u  s new kids were coming in and wandering around
clueless and terrified  etc   and tavis had wanted hal to take temporary charge of a nine year old kid coming in from somewhere
called philo il  who was allegedly blind  the kid  and apparently had cranium issues  from having originally been one of the
infantile natives of ticonderoga nny evacuated too late  and had several eyes in various stages of evolutionary development in
his head but was legally blind  but still an extremely solid player  which is all kind of a long tale in itself  given that his skull was
apparently the consistency of a chesapeake crabshell but the head itself so huge it made booboo look microcephalic  and the kid
apparently had on court use of only one hand because the other had to pull around beside him a kind of rolling iv stand appliance
with a halo shaped metal brace welded to it at head height  to encircle and support his head  but anyway tex watson and thorp
had broken c t  down over the kid s admission and tuition waver  and c t  now figured the kid would need to say the least some
extra help getting oriented  literally   and he wanted hal to be the one to take him in hand  again literally   it turned out a couple
days later that the kid had some kind of either family or cerebro spinal fluid crisis at home in rural il and wasn t matriculating
now till the spring term  but back in august hal had sat in the very chair trevor axford is now nodding off in  very late in the
day  like dusk  having had an informal exhibition match with a visiting latvian satellite pro go an encouraging three sets that
p m  so that he d missed mrs  c  s stuffed peppers at supper  his stomach making those where s the food noises from around the
transverse colon  alone in the blue room  waiting  the chair bobbing reflexively  with lateral alice moore gone home to her long
apartment with rooms only   m  wide in newton and an opaque plastic dust thing wrapped tight over her intel processor and
intercom console and the little red danger light on her danger  third rail plaque unlit  and the only lights besides the weak
dusk outside were the hot    w of his chairback s creepy blue shaded magazine lamp  plus the multiple lamps on in charles
tavis s office  tavis has a phobic thing about overhead lighting  as tavis was doing a late day intake interview on impossibly tiny
little tina echt  who just matriculated this fall at age seven  his doors were open because it was a brutal august and f  d  v 
harde had somehow rigged lateral alice s air conditioner vent in the waiting room so it really put out  tavis s office s outer door
opened out while the inner door opened in  which gave his little inter door vestibule kind of a jaw like quality  when exposed 
august y d a u  had been when hal s chronic left ankle had been almost the worst it s ever been  after an erumpent but
grueling summer tour of getting to at least the quarters of just about everything  mostly on hard asphalt        and he could feel
his pulse in the vessels in the raw ligaments of the ankle as he sat flipping the shiny pages of a new world tennis and watching
the little ad cards fall out and flutter  but he also couldn t help exploiting the open jawed view of a substantial section of charles
tavis at his office desk  looking as usual oddly foreshortened and small and with his hands together on the massive desktop across
from a partial profile view of a girl who looked like she couldn t be much more than five or six  preparing to receive intake papers
as she listened to tavis  there d been no echt parents or guardians anywhere in view  some kids just get dropped off  sometimes
the parents  cars barely even stop  just slow down  throw gravel as they accelerate away  tavis s desk drawers have squeaky
casters  jim struck s folks  lincoln hadn t even much slowed  struck had been helped to his feet and taken immediately to the
locker room to shower the gravel out of his hair  hal had been in charge of his orientation  too  when struck transferred  booted
out of palmer academy after his pet tarantula  named simone   another long story  escaped and wouldn t even have dreamed of
biting the headmaster s wife if she hadn t screamed and passed out and fallen right on it  struck explained as hal helped pick up
suitcases tumbled all over the drive 
like many gifted bureaucrats  hal s mother s adoptive brother charles tavis is physically small in a way that seems less
endocrine than perspectival  his smallness resembles the smallness of something that s farther away from you than it wants to be 
plus is receding        this weird appearance of recessive drift  together with the compulsive hand movements that followed his
quitting smoking some years back  helped contribute to the quality of perpetual frenzy about the man  a kind of locational panic
that it s easy to see explains not only tavis s compulsive energy   he and avril  pretty much the dynamic duo of compulsion 
between them  sleep  in their second floor rooms in the headmaster s house   separate rooms   tend to sleep  between them 
about as much as any one normal insomniac   but maybe also contributes to the pathological openness of his manner  the way he
thinks out loud about thinking out loud  a manner ortho stice can imitate so eerily that he s been prohibited by the male    s from
doing his tavis impression in front of the younger players  for fear that the littler kids will find it impossible to take the real tavis
seriously at the times he needs to be taken seriously 
as for the older kids  stice can make them all double up now merely by shielding his eyes with his hand and assuming a
horizon scan expression whenever tavis heaves into view  seeming to recede even as he bears down 
c t  as headmaster always has a number of introductory questions for matriculants  and hal  now  in november  can t
remember which one of these tavis opened with with echt  but he remembers seeing the little girl s sucker stick sweep the air and
a plastic mr  bouncety bounce       no pierce earring swing wildly as she shook her head  hal d marvelled at her size  how
high could somebody this little be ranked  even regionally  in    s 
and then yes the sumptuous squeak of tavis s big seagrass chair coming back forward as his elbows took his weight and he
laced his fingers together out across meters of polymer reinforced shale desktop  custom designed  the headmaster s smile as he
leaned back  though hidden from hal because of the shadow of the office s enormous stairblaster        was nevertheless
audible because of the thing with charles tavis s teeth  about which maybe the less said the better  looking discreetly in  hal had
felt an involuntary rush of affection for c t  his maternal uncle s hair was straight and very precisely combed over  and his little
mustache was never quite symmetrical  one eye was also set at a slightly different angle than the other  so that besides holding his
hand up to scan stice would also cock his head slightly to the side whenever c t  came near  hal s involuntary grin is lopsided
and only half felt  now  remembering  the axhandle s sitting there slumped  with his fist to his chin  a posture that he thinks
makes him look meditative but that really makes him look in utero  and kittenplan is chewing at her knuckles  tattoos  which is
what she does instead of washing them off 
then ortho stice had entered the hot waiting room  shirt wet and crew cut matted from the courts and toting his wilsons  and
made right for the ac vent s downdraft outside tavis s little vestibule  slice s clothes were comped by fila and when he played

 any sort of match he wore all black  and at e t a  and on the tour was known as the darkness  he had a crew cut and the
beginnings of jowls  he and hal exchanged the very slight sorts of nods people use when they like each other past all need for
politeness  they had similar games  although most of stice s touch was at the net  stice raised one hand to his eyes and cocked his
head slightly in the direction of the office s lamplight 
 the little guy going to be a long time in there  
 you have to ask  
tavis was saying  what actually we do for you here is to break you down in very carefully selected ways  take you apart as a
little girl and put you back together again as a tennis player who can take the court against any little girl in north america without
fear of limitation  with a perspective unmarred by the eyelashes of whatever pockets you brought here  a little girl now who can
regard the court as a mirror whose reflection holds no illusions or fear for you  
 now the thing with the skull   stice said  hal had watched gooseflesh rise on stice s arms and legs as he stood under the cold
air and faced up and breathed  hugging his gear to his chest 
 one possible way of couching it is to choose to say that we will take apart your skull very gently and reconstruct a skull for
you that will have a highly developed bump of clarity and a slight concave dent where the fear instinct used to be  i m doing my
best to cast all this in terms the you you are right now can be comfortable with  tina  though i need to tell you i feel
uncomfortable adjusting a presentation toward or down toward anyone in any way  since i m terribly vain  both as a man and an
educator  about my reputation for candor   tavis said  the audible smile   it is one of my limitations  
stice withdrew without even having to say goodbye to hal  they were at complete ease with one another  it had been a bit
different the year before  when hal was still in boys     s  hal heard stice say something to somebody out in the lobby  part of
c t  s impression of distance just past the eye s focal length was the fact that the two sides of his face didn t quite go together  it
wasn t as drastic as a stroke victim s face or a deformity  the subtlety of it was part of it  the essential vagueness about himself that
tavis fought by sort of peeling his skull back and exposing his brain to you without any sort of warning or invitation  it was part
of the man s preoccupied frenzy 
between ortho stice s exit and the moms s entry hal had been flexing the ankle and watching the swelling shift slightly under
the multiple socks  he stood and put his weight on the ankle experimentally a couple times and then sat back down and flexed it 
watching the swelling very intently  the way he knew suddenly that he was going to go down and get high in secret in the pump
room before showering was that it hadn t occurred to him to ask the darkness about making some sort of arrangements to eat
together  since stice had missed supper too  his viscera were putting out the sound of one of those teakettles that doesn t have a
whistle and so just rumbles as it boils  a competitive athlete cannot skip meals without terrific metabolic distress 
after a little while avril incandenza  e t a  s dean of academic affairs  had lowered her head under the waiting room s
jamb and come in  looking fresh and totally untouched by the heat  she had one of the orientation packets in its customary redand gray binder 
the moms always had this way of establishing herself in the exact center of any room she was in  so that from any angle she
was somehow in the line of all sight  it was part of her  and so to that extent dear to hal  but it was noticeable and kind of
unsettling  his brother orin  during a late night round of family trivia  had once described avril as the black hole of human
attention  hal had been pacing  rising up on the toes of the left foot  trying to gauge the exact level of physical discomfort he was
feeling  that s when she d come in  hal and the moms always greeted each other kind of extravagantly  when avril entered a
room  any sort of pacing reduced to orbiting  and hal s pacing became vaguely circular around the waiting room s perimeter as
avril rested her tailbone on the receptionist s desk and crossed her ankles and produced her cigarette case  her manner always
became very casual and almost sort of male when she and hal were alone in a room 
she watched him walk   the ankle  
he hated himself for exaggerating the limp even slightly   tender  sore at the very worst  more like tender  
 no  now  now no need to cry    c t  was exclaiming as he knelt at the side of the chair from which little legs dangled and
were spasming around   i didn t mean literally break  as in break open your bead  tina  please let me acknowledge that this is
totally my fault my dear for presenting what we ll be up to here in just exactly the wrong sort of light  
avril had casually produced a     mm  rodney from the flat brass case and tamped it on an unlined knuckle  hal produced no
lighter  neither of them had looked toward tavis s office s maw  avril s smock type dress was blue cotton  with a kind of
scalloped white doily around the shoulders and white stockings and painfully white reebok cross trainers 
 i am horrified that i ve made you cry like this   tavis s voice had assumed that stressed character of issuing from the end of a
long corridor   just please know that a totally unthreatening lap is available if you want a lap  is all i can think of to say  
avril always smoked with her smoking arm up and elbow resting in the crook of the other arm  she would frequently hold a
rodney just this same way without lighting it or even putting it in her mouth  she permitted herself to smoke only in her e t a 
office and hmh study and one or two other venues outfitted with air filtration equipment  her posture  that night  with her coccyx
against something and looking down the length of her legs  was awfully close to the way himself used to stand around  she
indicated c t  s door with her head 
 i gather he s been in there a while  
hal despised even the very slight suggestion of whine that came in   i ve been waiting here coming up on an hour   and that
he liked it a little that she looked pained for him as her tiny eyebrows  unplucked  just naturally tiny and arched  went up 
 you ve had nothing to eat  then  yet  
 i was summoned   
tavis s voice in there  til invite you right here and now to sit in my lap and let me make such soothing sounds as there there
there  
 want my mommy and daddy  
avril said   that s the old turn making those sounds then  and not the air conditioner   with that smile that was also a kind of
wince 
 couldn t even start to describe the sounds coming from down there  like that whistleless kettle himself used to leave on when

   
an apple appeared from a deep pocket in her smock   happen to have a spare granny smith here  to tack body to soul while
we wait  
he smiled tiredly at the big green apple   moms  that s your apple  that s all you re going to eat between    and     i happen
to know  
avril made a distended gesture   stuffed  huge lunch with a set of parents not three hours ago  i ve been staggering around
since   looking at the apple like she had no idea where it d even come from  til probably pitch this out  
 you will not  
 please   rising from the desk s edge without seeming to use muscles  apple held out like something distasteful  cigarette down
at her side where it would be putting a hole in the smock if lit   you d be doing us both a favor  
 this drives me bats  you know this drives me bats  
orin and hal s term for this routine is politeness roulette  this moms thing that makes you hate yourself for telling her the
truth about any kind of problem because of what the consequences will be for her  it s like to report any sort of need or problem is
to mug her  orin and hal had this bit  during family trivia sometimes   please  i m not using this oxygen anyway    what  this old
limb  take it  in the way all the time  take it    but it s a gorgeous bowel movement  mario   the living room rug needed
something  i didn t know what til right this very moment   the special fantodish chill of feeling both complicit and obliged  hal
despised the way he always reacted  taking the apple  pretending to pretend his reluctance to eat her supper was a pretense  orin
believed she did it all on purpose  which was way too easy  he said she went around with her feelings out in front of her with an
arm around the feelings  windpipe and a clock   mm  to the feelings  temple like a terrorist with a hostage  daring you to shoot 
the moms held the red binder out to hal without moving   have you seen alice s new packets   the apple was good sour but
perfumy from the pocket of the moms s smock  and it stimulated a torrent of saliva  the binder had different little informal and
action photos from the waiting room walls  and offprints of clippings  and three rings for the packet of guidelines and honor code
pledges  all done up by moore in a gothic ital 
hal looked up from the binder  indicating c t  s office with his head   you re taking the girl around yourself  
 we re encouragingly short staffed  thierry and donni won their qualifying round at hartford  so they re staying over   she
leaned way forward and looked in at c t  so he could see she was out here  she smiled 
hal followed her look   the girl s name s tina something and she ll come up to about your knee  
 echt   avril said  looking at something on a printout 
hal looked at her while he chewed   you don t like her already  
 tina echt  pawtucket  father apparently some sort of unleavened baker  mother a public relations person for the red sox
a a a  baseball there  
hal had to wipe his chin as he smiled   triple a  not a a a  
avril was leaning forward at the waist with the binder to her breast the way females hold flat things  still trying to catch the
headmaster s eye 
hal said  troeltsch finally has some competition in the repulsive last name department  
 lord she is a small one isn t she  
 i can t see her being more than maybe five  
 oh golly let s see  age seven  high i q   somewhat impoverished looking m m p i   played out of providence racquet and
bath in east providence  ranked thirty first in eastern    s as of june  
 she can t be much taller than her damn stick out there  when she plays  schtitt s going to keep her here what  twelve years  
 the girl s father has been calling about admission for her for over two years  charles said  
 he was doing that thing about taking skulls apart and she yelled bloody murder  
avril s laugh s onset was high pitched and alarming and distinctive  so now at least c t  would for sure know the moms was
out here waiting and would wind things up and maybe get to hal so hal could go get high in secret   well good for her   avril said 
the orbit took him around lateral alice moore s desk in a kind of thick ellipse  every time his left foot came down he either
dipped down or raised up briefly to tip toe  flexing the ankle   ten years here and she ll lose her mind  if she starts at seven she ll
either be ready for the show at fourteen or by fourteen she ll start getting that burned out look that makes you want to wave your
hand in front of her face  
there was the sound of tavis s squeaky right nunn bush pacing faster  which meant real conclusion   i m going to predict it s
probably hard to see yourself as a great athlete at this stage  tina  not being able to see over the net yet  but possibly even harder
to see yourself as providing entertainment  engaging people s attention  as a high velocity object people can project themselves
onto  forgetting their own limitations in the face of the nearly limitless potential someone as young as yourself represents  
the apple generated tremendous amounts of saliva   he ll put her in the show before menses  there ll be another enormous
fuss and high rental cartridges of a girl no larger than her racquet beating up on hairy slavic lesbians  and then by fourteen she ll
be like old coal in the bottom of a backyard grill   some old military joke about apples kept running through  eat the apple  fuck
the core  hal couldn t remember what it was supposed to signify 
the moms was snapping her fingers silently and working her forehead   there s some term for coals reduced to residue after
all day in a grill  i m trying to think  
hal hates this   clinkers   he said instantly   from klinker low german and klinckaerd old dutch  to sound  ring  nominated to
substantive around       a hard mass formed by the fusion of the earthy impurities of like coal  iron ore  limestone   he hated it
that she could even dream he d be taken in by the aphasiac furrowing and finger snapping  and then that he s always so pleased to
play along  is it showing off if you hate it 
 clinker  
 a grill wouldn t have clinkers  charcoal s refined to burn right down to dust  clinkers are sort of metallic  i think  see for
example the ring dash sound etymology  
 i like to suspect this is why so many of our older players like to project me into this carnival barker persona with tiny balance

 sheets revolving in my eyes  that i m up front with every incoming addition to our family that this is where the resources come
from for professional tennis  and for the north american junior development system for gifted children who want to scale the
heights to professionalism or to a competitive college career  and so ultimately for an academy like this one s considerable
operating expenses  and for scholarships like the partial one we re so happy to be able to offer your parents for you  
 so then perhaps you d care to join us for dinner  we ll also have ms  echt if she can stay up that long  
the core made a very muffled cymbal sound in the bottom of lateral alice s wastebasket   i can t get out of dawns  wayne
and i are supposed to play slobodan       and hartigan at some corporate spectacle thing at au burndale right after lunch  
 have you had barry speak to gerhardt about the ankle not getting better  
 the clay ll be good to it  schtitt knows all about the ankle  
 well best of british luck to you both   avril s purse looked more like soft luggage than like a purse   may i lend you the key
to the kitchen  then  
it s always the moms s left shoulder hal looks over  whenever he orbits  and his plans emerged between avril s invitations to
accept some sort of politeness act   the darkness and i were going to blast down the hill and grab something if and when i ever
get out of here  
 oh  
then he wondered with dread what stice might have said to her on her way in  re supper   maybe pemulis too  i think pemulis
said  
 well do not  under any circumstances  enjoy yourself  
echt and tavis were both standing  now  in there  their handshake looked  for the first split second he looked  like c t  was
jacking off and the little girl was going sieg heil  hal thought he was maybe starting to lose his mind  even the meat of the
granny smith smelled like perfume 
three months later  earlier today  before being again summoned  at the dentist s  the dentist s office had had a weird sharp
clean sweet smell about it  the olfactory equivalent of fluorescent light  hal had felt the cold stab in the gum and then the slow
radial freeze  his face ballooning to become one of the frozen cumuli against the aftershave blue of the dental wallpaper s sky 
zegarelli d d s  had dry dark green eyes that bulged above his mint blue mask  as in like olives where eyes should be  as he
leaned in to proceed  his dental overhead light s corona giving him one of those malperspectived medieval halos that seem to stand
on end  even masked  zegarelli s breath is infamous   e t a s forced for the first time by their e t a  group plan to recline
below zegarelli are counselled on how to respire  to inhale when zegarelli inhales and exhale right back out with him  to avoid
doubling the amount of suffering hal s already gone through  just today 
charles tavis is not a buffoon  the thing that s keeping things so tensely quiet out here amid all this waiting room blue is that
there are historically at least two charles tavises  the three older boys know  the openly cross sectional and free associating and
arms waving on the perspectival horizon dithering hand wringing total worry persona is really tavis s version of social
composure  his way of trying to get along with you  but just ask michael pemulis  whose sneakers have been on tavis s carpet so
often they ve left an unvacuumable impression in the checked antron  when tavis loses his composure  when the integrity or
smooth function of the academy or his unquestioned place at the e t a  tiller is god forbid threatened  hal s openly adjustable
uncle becomes a different man  one not to be fucked with  it s not necessarily pejorative to compare a cornered bureaucrat to a cornered rat  the danger sign to watch out for is if tavis suddenly gets very quiet and very still  because then he seems 
perspectivally  to grow  he seems  sitting there  to rush in at you  dopplering in at a whisper  almost looming over you from
across the huge desk  if shit meets administrative fan  kids coming out of his mandible doored office come out pale and rubbing
their eyes  not from tears but from this depth perspective skewing that c t  suddenly effects  when there s shit 
another alert is when lateral alice moore gets formally buzzed to bring you and the others in  instead of the office doors
ever opening from inside  and when she gets up and edges over to show you in like you re some sort of hat holding salesman 
without once meeting your eye  as if there s shame  one big family 
the diddle check seems like it s degenerated into the girls all getting very excited and exchanging data on what kinds of
animals members of their own biologic families either imitate or physically resemble  and avril s out of sight and silent and
apparently letting them go with it for a while and vent stress  hal keeps checking for jaw drool with the back of his hand  pemulis 
in a cyrillic lettered t shirt  takes off the hat and looks around himself and makes reflexive tie straightening movements  taking
one last look at his lines on the printout while axford stands there needing three tries to work the outside door s knob  ann
kittenplan  on the other hand  wears an expression of almost regal calm  and precedes them through the inner door like someone
stepping down off a dais 
and it also seems somehow sinister that she s apparently been in here all this time  this clenette person  one of the ninemonth temps from down the hill  pretty eyed and so black she s got a bluish cast  with hair ironed straight and then pinned up and
the standard e t a  custodial teal blue zip upable jumpsuit  emptying tavis s personal brass wastebaskets into her big cart with its
gray canvas sides  the way she stares at a point just to the side of hal s own stare as she and her cart wait at c t  s inner door for
hal and the others to be ushered sideways through by lateral alice moore  the cart  like poor otis lord s own game master s cart 
has a crazy wheel  and clatters a bit even buried in shag  trying to maneuver around moore as she reverses back along the
vestibule s wall  neither schtitt nor delint is in here  but from the hiss of pemulis s inhale hal can tell that dr  dolores rusk is in
the room even before he takes his eyes from a c t  who s sitting pulsing with swollen proximity in his seagrass swivel chair and
almost done coolly bending a giant paper clip into a sort of cardioid or else sloppy circle  tavis s window lit shadow now reaches
all the way past the stairblaster to the red and gray fabric ottoman along the east wall  in which sits sure enough rusk  her hose
laddered and face betraying nothing  and then next to her is poor old otis p  lord  the hitachi monitor still over his head like the
sallet of some grotesque high tech knight  slumped and with his sneakers pointing at each other in the blue and black shag  hands
in his lap  two crude eye holes cut into the black plastic casing of the monitor s base  lord not meeting pemulis s eye  and wicked
hanging shards of glass from the screen he fell through pointing   some nearly touching  even   his slim neck and throat  so he
has to hold his head very still  despite the heavings of his shallow chest  with the day shift e t a  nurse standing behind him and
inclined over the back of the sofa to hold the monitor very carefully in place  the incline producing cleavage which hal would

 gladly choose to be the sort of person not to note  lord s eyes move to hal and blink dolefully through the holes  and he can be
heard sniffing moistly in there  complexly muffled  and pemulis is just finishing moving his feet precisely into their familiar
impressions in the office carpet when c t   seeming direly to rise from his chair without getting up  quietly asks the room s last
occupant   the scrubbed young button nosed urologist in an o n a n t a  blazer  severely underdue at e t a   seated back in
the shadow of the open inner door in the room s southeast corner  so he s hidden right behind them from the start and there s the
opportunity for this stagy incriminating type whirl and kertwang face from axford and hal as they hear charles tavis addressing
the urine expert behind them  asking him very quietly please to close both doors 

pre dawn and dawn    may y d a u  outcropping northwest of tucson az u s a   still
 you can t say it s only a u s  thing   steeply said again   i went through school when mu ticulturalism was inescapable  we
read about the japanese and indonesians  for example  having a mythic figure  i forget its name  oriental myth  it s a woman
covered with long blond hair  entirely  her whole body with blond down all over it  
 this type of passive temptation  part of it seems to include a felt lack  a perceived deprivation  orientals are not bodily a
hairy culture  
 these multicultural oriental myths always had young oriental men happening upon her by some body of water combing her
body hair and singing  and they have sex with her  apparently she s simply too exotic and intriguing or seductive to resist  even
the young oriental men who know of the myths can t resist  according to the myths  
 and are rendered paralyzed with stasis by this intimate act   marathe said  when now he dreamt of his father  it was of the
two skating  young marathe and m  marathe  at a st  remi d amherst outdoor rink  m  mar athe s breath visible and his
pacemaker a boxy bulge in his brunswickian cardigan 
 killed outright  usually  the pleasure s too intense  no mortal can stand it  kills them  m o r t s  
marathe sniffed 
 the analogous part is how even the ones who know the pleasure of it will kill them  they go ahead anyway  
marathe coughed 
some of the insects flying had multiple pairs of wings and were bio luminescent  they seemed very intent  flying past the
outcropping and darting jaggedly off on a course  on their way to something urgent  the sound of them  the insects  made marathe
think of playing cards in the bicycle spokes of the bicycle of a boy with legs  both men were silent  this is the time of false
dawns  venus moved east away from them  the softest light imaginable seeped into the desert and spread into the strange tan
vistas around them  something heating just below the ring of night  his blanket of the lap was covered in burrs and small spiked
seeds of some species  the u s a  desert began to rustle with life of which most remained hidden  in the american sky  the stars
fluttering like banked flames above a low resolution seepage of glow  but none of the pinkening of genuine dawn 
both the u s a  office of unspecified services and les assassins des fau teuils rollents looked forward to these meetings of
marathe and steeply  they accomplished little  it was their sixth or seventh  meeting  steeply had volunteered to be liaison with
marathe s betrayal  despite language        the a f r  believed marathe functioned as a triple agent  pretending to betray his
nation for his wife  memorizing every detail of the meetings with b s s  according to steeply  steeply s b s s  superiors did not
know that fortier knew that steeply knew he  fortier  knew marathe was here  steeply held this fact back from his superiors  it
satisfied some u s a  desire to hold some small thing back from one s superiors  marathe felt  unless steeply was deceiving
marathe about this  marathe did not know  m  fortier did not know marathe had reached the internal choice that he loved his
skull deprived and heart defective wife gertraud marathe more than he loved the separatist and anti o n a n  cause of the nation
quebec  making marathe no better than m  rodney  the god  tine  if fortier knew of this  he would understandably drive a
railroad spike through gertraud s boneless right eye  killing her and marathe both 
the real marathe gestured outward at the glowing but unpink east   a false dawn  
 no   steeply said   but your own francophone myth of your odalisk of theresa  
 l odalisque de sainte therese   marathe rarely yielded to the temptation to correct steeply  whose horrid pronunciation and
the syntax as well marathe could never determine for sure either was or was not an intentional irritant  intended to discomfit
marathe 
steeply said  the multicultural myth being that the odalisk s so beautiful that mortal quebecois eyes can t take it  whoever
looks at her turns into a diamond or gem  
 in most versions an opal  
 a medusa in reverse  one might say  
both men  well versed in this  mirthlessly laughed       
marathe said  the greeks  they did not fear beauty  they feared ugliness  hence i think beauty and pleasure  these were not
fatal temptations for the greek type  
 or like a combination of medusa and circe  your odalisk  said steeply  he was smoking either his last or one of his purse s
pack s last cigarettes   the american s habit to throw the butts off the outcropping had prevented marathe from counting the
consumed butts  marathe knew that steeply knew that filters of cigarettes did not biodegrade for the environment  the two men 
by this juncture of time  each knew the other 
a hidden bird twittered 
 the greek mythic personality  it had also pregnancy by rain and rape by fowl  
 and haven t we come a long way   steeply said ironically 
 this irony and contempt for selves  these also are part of your u s a  type s temptation  i think  
 whereas your type s a man of only actions  ends   steeply said  with marathe could not tell whether irony or maybe not 
the desert floor was brightening by imperceptible degrees  its surface the color of overtanned hide  the saguaro cactus
reptile hued  potentially young forms in down sleeping bags of coffinous shape were now discernible around the black remains of
the night s bonfire  the air smelled of green wood  a tasteless odor of dust  the distant construction site s payloaders were urine 

 colored and appeared frozen in the middle of various actions  it was still chill  marathe s teeth had a palpable film on them  of
perhaps a paste of dust  especially the front teeth  no sun s top arc was appearing  and marathe could cast no shadow yet on the
shale behind them 
remy marathe s resting pulse rate was very low  no legs to require blood from the heart  he very rarely felt phantom pains 
and then only in the stump of the left  all a f r s have enormous arms  particularly upper arms  marathe was left handed  steeply
manipulated his cigarette with his left hand and used his right arm to cradle the left elbow  but marathe knew quite well that
steeply was right handed  the little wens of his field persona s electrolysis were now brightly pink against the pallor of steeply s
face  which appeared both puffy and drawn 
the cloudless sky above the east s mountains of rincon range was the faint sick pink of an unhealed burn  the whole
imperceptibly lightening scene of the vistas had a stillness about it that suggested photography  marathe had long ago placed his
watch in his windbreaker s pocket  to keep from continually checking  steeply enjoyed imagining that his interface dictated its
own period and time  marathe had chosen to indulge this 
marathe realized about himself that some of his pretended sniffing was for the purpose of alerting steeply to the breaking of a
silence   you could seat yourself briefly  if you have fatigue  the shoes  straps      he gestured slightly 
steeply made a show of looking down and prodding at the tan stone s dust with the toes of his shoe   it looks like there might
be things  
 i must soon leave   marathe s hand was imprinted with the texture of the sterling s pebbled grip  tt has been good to be in the
air for a night  soon i must leave  
 crawling around  the skirt  it makes one sensitive about simply plopping down wherever you wish  possibility of things      
crawling up   he looked up at marathe  he appeared sad   i d never realized  

    h      november year of the depend adult undergarment front office  ennet house
d a r h   enfield ma
 didn t know whether to shit or shout dixie after it went off  and the look on his face  
 one of the times for me was i m in some bar in lowell with some guys i m crewing around with and we were there with
some other guys  just fucking lowell knuckleheads  your young drunks that are just getting to be your young working type drunks
that stop off after work for just a couple and don t make it home til closing  just putting away boilermakers and playing darts and
this and that  and this one guy on the crew starts making moves on this one guy s girl  this real ordinary looking guy s in there
with his girl and one of our guys starts saying this and that to her  trying to pick her up  and her date got pissed off  you know 
who can blame him  and there was words exchanged and so on and so forth  and we was all there with this first guy  in our like
group  he was the one talking the shit to this guy s girl but he was our boy  we re all in the crew  so we all crew up on this girl s
date and push him around somewhat  you know how it is  say he s talking shit to our boy  he gets a little bit of a beating  dopeslaps  nothing like extreme or blood  and we kick his ass around a little bit and toss him out of this bar and get this girl to drink
boilermakers with us and the one guy that was making the moves on her in the first place gets her to start playing strip darts  like
taking off bits of clothes for points in darts  which the keep isn t too like thrilled but these boys are his customers  it s like family 
we re all real drunk and playing strip darts  
t get the picture  sounds like a real nice picture  
 except when i got a little smarter later i learned you never in a neighborhood bar fu  you don t ever mess with a local guy
with a girl and make him look small in front of the girl and then stay there where it happened if he leaves  because it s this kind of
guy always comes back  
 you learned to leave  
 because this guy like a half hour later on he comes back packing  packing means there s a item involved  now  see  
 item  
 a gun  this wasn t a big one  i m remembering a     somewhat  in that range  but in he comes and comes straight over to the
dart game and the girl that s down to her slip and pulls it out and without saying nothing up and comes right over and shoots our
boy  that d taken his girl and made him look small  shoots him right in the head  right in the back of the head  
 boy was crazy as a shithouse rat  
 well joelle he d got made small in front of his girl  and we stayed  and he came back and plugged him in the back of the
head  
 and killed him dead  
 not right away he didn t die  the negativest part for me is what we do  all us guys with the guy that was shot  we are all
very fucked up by this point in time  i remember it not seeming real  the keep s busy calling the finest  the guy drops the item and
the keep grabbed him and covered him with the bar piece and called the finest and kept the guy back behind the bar  i think
mostly now to keep us from eliminating his map right there  out of payback  we re all blotto zombie drunk by this juncture  the
girl  there was blood all down the side of her slip  and here our boy s shot in the head  the guy d shot him right through the back of
the head from the side  and blood s all over  you always maybe think of individuals bleeding in this one way  like steady  but your
serious bleeding comes with the pulse  if you didn t know  it like shoots out and dies down and shoots out  
 don t have to tell me  
 well i don t know you  joelle  am i right  i don t know what you seen or know  
 i saw an old boy cut his hand off with a chainsaw cutting back brush back of the cumberland when i was fishing with my
daddy  like to have bled to death right there  my daddy had to use his belt  before he got it tied off the blood came like that  with
the pulse  my daddy got him to the hospital in his car  like to saved his life  he d had some training  he could save lives like that  
 i tell you  what still gets me is we was so drunk we didn t even somehow take it seriously  because everything seemed like a
movie when i got real drunk  i still wish we d thought to take him to the hospital right away  we could of piled him in  he wasn t
dead yet even though he didn t look good  we didn t even lay him down  we got this idea  one of the guys started walking him

 around  we all walked him around in circles like some kind of o d   thought if we could keep him walking til the wagon came
he d be ok  by the end we was dragging him  i think then he was dead  blood all over everybody  the gun wasn t more than an
old      people was yelling at us to pile him in and take him to the hospital  but we d got this walking him around idea into our
heads  to hold him up and walk him in circles  the girl s screaming and trying to put her stockings on and we re yelling to the guy
that d shot him how we were going to off with his map and so on and so forth  till the keep called an ambulance and they came and
he was dead as a stick  
 gately that s really bad  
 why are you even up  don t have to work  
 i like it when it snows real early like this  this is the best window  but you learned a lesson  
 his name was chuck or chick  the one that got shot that time  
 did you hear that mcdade person at supper  you know how some folks have one of their legs shorter than the other  
 i don t listen to those guys  crap  
 it was down at the far end of the table at supper  he was telling ken and me how he had a counselor when he was in juvenile
in jamaica plain  he had this counselor he said she had this condition where each leg was shorter than the other  
 i don t think i follow you  joelle  
 each of the woman s legs was shorter than the other  
 how can a leg that s shorter than the other leg have the other leg shorter than it  
 he was having us on  he said the point was an aa point  that it defied sense and explaining and you just had to accept it on
faith  that creepy randy guy with the white wig was backing him up with a very straight face  mcdade said she walked like a
metronome  he was making fun of us  but i still thought it was funny  
 maybe tell me about this veil of yours  then  joelle  if we re talking about defied sense  
 waaaay out to one side  then waaaay out to the other side  
 really  let s really interface if you re in here  how come with the veil  
 bridal thing  
     
 aspiring muslim  
 i didn t mean to pry in  you can just tell me if you don t want to talk about the veil  
 i m also in another fellowship  with almost four years in  
 u h i d  
 it s the union of the hideously and improbably deformed  the veil is a sort of fellowship caparison  
 what s it compared to  
 we all wear one  almost all of us  with some time in  
 but if you don t mind  how come you re in it  u h i d   how re you supposed to be deformed  it s nothing that sticks way
out  if i can say it  are you  like  missing something  
 there s a brief ceremony  it s a bit like giving out chips over at the better late than never meeting  for varying lengths 
the new u h i d s stand and receive the veil and don the veil and stand there and recite that the veil they ve donned is a type and
a symbol  and that they are choosing freely to be bound to wear it always   a day at a time   both in light and darkness  both in
solitude and before others  gaze  and as with strangers so with familiar friends  even daddies  that no mortal eye will see it
withdrawn  that they hereby declare openly that they wish to hide from all sight  unquote  
     
 i ve also got a membership card that spells out everything you could ever want to know  and more  
 except i ve asked pat and tommy s  and still the thing i don t get is why join a fellowship just to hide  i can see if somebody
is like   you know  hideously   and they ve been hiding away in the dark all their life  and they want to come in and join a
fellowship where everybody s equal and everybody can identify because they all spent their whole life hiding also  and you join a
fellowship so you can step out of the dark and into the group and get support and finally show yourself minus eyes or with three
ti  arms or whatever and be accepted by people that know just what it s like  and like in aa they say they ll love you till you can
like love yourself and accept yourself  so you don t care what people see or think anymore  and you can finally step out of the cage
and quit hiding  
that s aa  
 kind of  a little bit  i think  
 well mr  gately what people don t get about being hideously or improbably deformed is that the urge to hide is offset by a
gigantic sense of shame about your urge to hide  you re at a graduate wine tasting party and improbably deformed and you re the
object of stares that the people try to conceal because they re ashamed of wanting to stare  and you want nothing more than to hide
from the covert stares  to erase your difference  to crawl under the tablecloth or put your face under your arm  or you pray for a
power failure and for this kind of utter liberating equalizing darkness to descend so you can be reduced to nothing but a voice
among other voices  invisible  equal  no different  hidden  
 is this like this thing they talked about about people hating their faces on videophones  
 but don you re still a human being  you still want to live  you crave connection and society  you know intellectually that
you re no less worthy of connection and society than anyone else simply because of how you appear  you know that hiding
yourself away out of fear of gazes is really giving in to a shame that is not required and that will keep you from the kind of life
you deserve as much as the next girl  you know that you can t help how you look but that you are supposed to be able to help how
much you care about how you look  you re supposed to be strong enough to exert some control over how much you want to hide 
and you re so desperate to feel some kind of control that you settle for the appearance of control  
 your voice gets different when you talk about this shit  
 what you do is you hide your deep need to hide  and you do this out of the need to appear to other people as if you have the
strength not to care how you appear to others  you stick your hideous face right in there into the wine tasting crowd s visual

 meatgrinder  you smile so wide it hurts and put out your hand and are extra gregarious and outgoing and exert yourself to appear
totally unaware of the facial struggles of people who are trying not to wince or stare or give away the fact that they can see that
you re hideously  improbably deformed  you feign acceptance of your deformity  you take your desire to hide and conceal it
under a mask of acceptance  
 use less words  
 in other words you hide your hiding  and you do this out of shame  don  you re ashamed of the fact that you want to hide
from sight  you re ashamed of your uncontrolled craving for shadow  u h i d  s first step is admission of powerlessness over the
need to hide  u h i d  allows members to be open about their essential need for concealment  in other words we don the veil  we
don the veil and wear the veil proudly and stand very straight and walk briskly wherever we wish  veiled and hidden  and but now
completely up front and unashamed about the fact that how we appear to others affects us deeply  about the fact that we want to
be shielded from all sight  u h i d  supports us in our decision to hide openly  
 you seem like you drift in and out of different ways of talking  sometimes it s like you don t want me to follow  
 well i ve got a brand new life  just out of the wrapper  which you all say ll take some time to fit  
 so they teach you how to accept your nonacceptance  the union  you re saying  
 you followed very well  you didn t need fewer words at all  if you don t mind my saying so  my sense is that you think
you re not bright but you re not  
 not bright  
 i put that poorly  you re not not bright  as in you re incorrect in thinking you have nothing upstairs  
 it s a self esteem issue  then  you re seeing in me after like three days here  then  i feel low esteem about how i think i m not
bright enough for some people  
 which is fine  u h i d  would say  to illustrate the u h i d  take versus an apparently more aa take  u h i d  d say it s fine
to feel inadequate and ashamed because you re not as bright as some others  but that the cycle becomes annular and insidious if
you begin to be ashamed of the fact that being unbright shames you  if you try to hide the fact that you feel mentally inadequate 
and so go around making jokes about your own dullness and acting as if it didn t bother you at all  pretending you didn t care
whether others perceived you as unbright or not  
 this makes the front of my head hurt  trying to follow this  
 well you ve been up all night  
 then now i have to go to my other fucking job  
 you re way brighter than you think  don g   although i doubt anything anyone else says can get in there into the gnawed
ragged place where you re afraid you re slow and dull  
 and what makes you think i think i m not bright  unless it s you re saying it s obvious to anybody i m not bright  
 i didn t mean to pry  just tell me if you don t want to speak to someone you barely know about it  
 now you re being sarcastic on what i said before  
     
 i got kicked off of football my tenth grade year for flunking english    you played american football  
 i was good til i got kicked off  they gave me a tutor and i still flunked    i used to twirl a baton at halftimes  i went to a
special camp six summers running  
     
 but a lot of the forms of self hatred there is no veil for  u h i d  s taught a lot of us to be grateful that there s at least a veil
for our form    so the veil s a way to not hide it    to hide openly  is more like it  
 i m already seeing it s very different from the drug recovery agenda  the aa and na program  
 can i ask how you re deformed  
 the best is when the sun s coming up right through the snow and everything looks so white  
     
 i almost forgot why i came on in  that that kate girl said ken e  like to get killed by some son of a bitch last night at that
waltham na thing and they want somebody to tell johnette not to make them go back again if they don t want  
 one is kate and ken can talk for themselves with johnette and i don t need to pry in and you sure don t need to pry in and
rescue nobody else  two is you re all of a sudden talking different again  and when you were talking about the veil you didn t
sound like you to me  and three is don t think i can t see you re coming out sideways all over the place about when i asked can i
ask what deformity you re not hiding the fact that you re hiding under that thing  the staff part of me wants to say if you don t
want to answer it just say so  but don t try and go around the side and think you can distract me into forgetting i asked it  
 the u h i d  in me would say you re trapped in shame about the shame  in response  and that the shame circle keeps you
from really being present for your staff job  don  you re more bugged by the possibility that i m treating you as unbright and
distractable than you are about a resident s inability to come right out and openly exercise her right to refuse to answer an
incredibly private and drug unrelated question  
 and now she s back to talking like a fucking english teacher again  but ignore that  that s not the point  look at how you re
trying to get our dialogue all distracted up in shame and me again instead of saying yes or no to me asking will you tell me what
you re missing behind that veil  
 oh you re good at hiding mr  g  you re good  the minute we start to poke at any inadequacies you re ashamed of  see  you
drop behind your own protective mask of house staff and start probing areas that you now know i can t bring myself to be open
about   since you got me to tell you all about u h i d  s philosophy of hiding   so that your own sense of inadequacy gets either
buried or used as a backlight to illuminate my own inability to be open and straightforward  the best defense is a good offense
isn t it mr  football player  
 aspirin time  now  with all the words  you win  go watch the snow come down someplace else  
 the thing is  mr  staff  i ve already just completely opened up about my shame and my inability to be open and
straightforward about this  you re exposing something i ve already held up to view  it s your shame about being ashamed of what

 you re afraid might be seen as a lack of brightness that s getting to stay buried under this dead horse of my deformity that you re
trying to whip  
 and then meantime you still didn t say a straight on yes or no to can i ask what s up behind there  are you cross eyed or
have a like beard  or do you have like really bad skin under there even though your skin everyplace that isn t hidden looks   
 looks what  my unhidden skin is what  
 see  this is you keep trying to sidetrack instead of just saying no to can i ask  just say no  try it  it s ok  nothing bad ll
happen  just try it straight out  
 perfect  you were going to say every visible expanse of my skin is just drop dead creamy perfect  
 jesus  why am i even here  why don t you just interface with yourself if you think you know all my issues and shames and
everything i m going to say  why not take the suggestion to say no  why come in here  did i come to you  to talk  was i just
sitting in here trying to keep awake and do the log and getting ready to go mop shit with a shoe freak and did or didn t you waltz
on in and sit down and come to me  
 don  i m perfect  i m so beautiful i drive anybody with a nervous system out of their fucking mind  once they ve seen me
they can t think of anything else and don t want to look at anything else and stop carrying out normal responsibilities and believe
that if they can only have me right there with them at all times everything will be all right  everything  like i m the solution to
their deep slavering need to be jowl to cheek with perfection  
 now with the sarcasm  
 i am so beautiful i am deformed  
 now with the nonrespectful acting out of treating me like i m stupid for trying to get her to walk through her fear to give a
straight out no  which she isn t willing  
 i am deformed with beauty  
 you want to see my professional staff face here s my staff face  i nod and smile  i treat you like somebody i have to humor
by nodding and smiling  and behind the face i m going with my finger around and around my temple like what a fucking yutz 
like where s the net  
 believe what you want  i m powerless over what you believe  i know  
 see the professional staffer writing in the meds log   six extra strong kind aspirin for staff after sarcasm and sideways
refusal to walk through fears and sarcastic acting out by newcomer who thinks she knows everybody else s issues  
 what position did you play  
       that the staffer wonders how come she s even here in treatment then  if she knows so much  

it is starting to get quietly around ennet house that randy lenz has found his own dark way to deal with the well known
rage and powerless ness issues that beset the drug addict in his first few months of abstinence 
the nightly aa or na meetings get out at  l oh  or   ooh   and curfew isn t until       and every ennet resident mostly
carpools back to the house with whatever residents have cars  or some of them go out in cars for massive doses of ice cream and
coffee 
lenz is one of the ones with a car  a heavily modified old duster  white with what look like    gauge blasts of rust over the
wheelwells  with oversized rear tires and an engine so bored out for heavy breathing speed it s a small miracle he still has a
license 
lenz sets loafer one outside ennet house only after sunset  and then only in his white toupee and mustache and billowing tallcollared topcoat  and goes only to the required nightly meetings  and the thing is that he ll never drive his own car to the meetings 
he always thumbs along with somebody else and adds to the crowd in their car  and then he always has to sit in the northernmost
seat in the car  for some reason  using a compass and napkin to plot out what the night s major direction of travel ll be and then
figuring out what seat he ll have to be in to stay maximally north  both gately and johnette foltz have had to make a nightly
routine of telling the other residents that lenz is teaching them valuable patience and tolerance 
but then after the meeting lets out  lenz never thumbs back with anybody  he always walks back to the house after meetings 
he says it s that he needs the air  what with being shut up in the crowded house all day and avoiding doors and windows  hiding
from both sides of the justice system 
and then one wednesday after the brookline young people s aa up beacon by chestnut hill it takes him right up to      to
get home  almost two hours  even though it s like a half hour walk and even burt smith did it in september in under an hour  and
lenz gets back just at curfew and without saying a word to anybody books right up to his and glynn s and day s room  polo
topcoat flapping and powdered wig shedding powder  and sweating  and making an unacceptable classy shoed racket running up
the men s side s carpetless stairs  which gately didn t have time to go up and address because of having to deal with bruce green
and amy j  separately both missing curfew 
lenz abroad in the urban night  solo  on almost a nightly basis  sometimes carrying a book 
residents who seem to make it a point to go off alone a lot are red flagged at thursday s all staff meeting in pat s office as
clear relapse risks  but they ve pulled spot urines on lenz five times  and the three times the lab didn t fuck up the e m i t  test
lenz s urine s come back clean  gately s basically decided to just let lenz be  some newcomers  higher power is like nature  the
sky  the stars  the cold penny tang of the autumn air  who knows 
so lenz abroad in the night  unaccompanied and disguised  apparently strolling  he s mastered the streets  cockeyed grid
around enfield brighton allston  south cambridge and east newton and north brookline and the hideous spur  he takes sidestreets home from meetings  mostly  low rent dumpster strewn residential streets and projects  driveways that become alleys 
gritty passages behind stores and dumpsters and warehouses and loading docks and empire waste displacement s mongo hangars 
etc  his loafers have a wicked shine and make an elegant dancerly click as he walks along with his hands in his pockets and open
coat flared wide  scanning  he scans for several nights before he even becomes aware of why or what he might be scanning
for        he moves nightly through urban animal territory  liberated housecats and hard core strays ooze in and out of

 shadows  rustle in dumpsters  fuck and fight with hellish noises all around him as he walks  senses very sharp in the downscale
night  you got your rats  your mice  your stray dogs with tongues hanging and countable ribs  maybe the odd feral hamster and or
raccoon  everything slinky and furtive after sunset  also non stray dogs that clank their chains or bay or lunge  when he goes by
yards with dogs  he prefers to move north but will move east or west on the streets  good sides  his shoes  fine click precedes him
by several hundred meters on cement of varying texture 
sometimes near drainage pipes he sees serious rats  or sometimes near cat free dumpsters  the first conscious thing he did
was a rat that this one time he came on some rats in a wide w e alley by the loading dock out behind the svelte nail co  just east
of watertown on n  harvard st  what night was that  it d been coming back from east watertown  which meant more will be
revealed na with glynn and diehl instead of st  e  s better late than never aa with the rest of the house s herd  so a monday 
so on a monday he d been strolling through this one alley  his steps echoing trebled back off the cement sides of the docks and the
north left wall he hugged  scanning without knowing what he was scanning for  up ahead there was the stegosaurus shape of a
svelte co  dumpster as versus your lower slimmer e w d  type dumpster  there were dry skulky sounds issuing from the
dumpster s shadow  he hadn t consciously picked anything up  the alley s surface was coming apart and lenz barely broke his
dancerly stride picking a kilo sized chunk of tar shot concrete  it was rats  two big rats were going at a half eaten wiener in a
mustardy paper tray from a lunchwagon in a recess between the north wall and the dumpster s barge hitch  their hideous pink
tails were poking out into the alley s dim light  they didn t move as randy lenz came up behind them on the toes of his loafers 
their tails were meaty and bald and like twitched back and forth  twitching in and out of the dim yellow light  the big flat top
chunk came down on most of one rat and a bit of the other rat  there d been godawful twittering squeaks  but the major hit on the
one rat also made a very solid and significant noise  some aural combination of a tomato thrown at a wall and a pocketwatch
getting clocked with a hammer  material came out of the rat s anus  the rat lay on its side in a very bad medical way  its tail
twitching and anus material and there were little beads of blood on its whiskers that looked black  the beads  in the sodium
security lights along the svelte nail co  roof  its side heaved  its back legs were moving like it was running  but this rat wasn t
going anywhere  the other rat had vanished under the dumpster  dragging its rear region  there were more chunks of dismantled
street lying all over  when lenz brought another down on the head of the rat he consciously discovered what he liked to say at the
moment of issue resolution was   there  
demapping rats became lenz s way of resolving internal type issues for the first couple weeks of it  walking home in the
verminal dark 
don gately  house chef and shopper  buys these huge econo size boxes of hefty       bags that get stored under the
kitchen sink for whoever s got trash for their weekly chore  ennet house generates serious waste 
so after vermin started to get a little ho hum and insignificant  lenz starts cabbaging a hefty bag out from under the sink and
taking it with him to meetings and walking back home with it  he keeps a trashbag neatly folded in an inside pocket of his
topcoat  a billowing top collared lauren polo model he loves and uses a daily lint roller on  he also takes along a little of the
house s food bank tunafish in a zip loc baggie in another pocket  which your average drug addict has expertise in rolling baggies
into a cylinder so they re secure and odor free 
the ennet house residents call hefty bags  irish luggage    even mcdade   it s a street term 
randy lenz found that if he could get an urban cat up close enough with some outstretched tuna he could pop the hefty bag
over it and scoop up from the bottom so the cat was in the air in the bottom of the bag  and then he could tie the bag shut with the
complimentary wire twist tie that comes with each bag  he could put the closed bag down next to the vicinity s northernmost wall
or fence or dumpster and light a gasper and hunker down up next to the wall to watch the wide variety of changing shapes the bag
would assume as the agitated cat got lower on air  the shapes got more and more violent and twisted and mid air with the passage
of a minute  after it stopped assuming shapes lenz would dab his butt with a spitty finger to save the rest for later and get up and
untie the twist tie and look inside the bag and go   there   the  there  turned out to be crucial for the sense of brisance and closure
and resolving issues of impotent rage and powerless fear that like accrued in lenz all day being trapped in the northeastern
portions of a squalid halfway house all day fearing for his life  lenz felt 
there evolved for lenz a certain sportsman s hierarchy of types of cats and neighborhoods of types of your abroad cats  and
he becomes a connoisseur of cats the same way a deep sea sportsman knows the fish species that fight most fiercely and
excitatingly for their marine lives  the best and most fiercely alive cats could usually claw their way out of a hefty bag  though 
which created this conundrum where the ones most worth watching assuming bagged shapes were the ones lenz risked maybe not
getting his issues resolved on  watching a spike furred hissing cat run twisting away still half wrapped in a plastic bag made lenz
admire the cat s fighting spirit but still feel unresolved 
so the next stage is lenz gives ms  charlotte treat or ms  hester thrale some of his own   when they go down to the palace
spa or father son to buy smokes or lifesavers and has them start to get him special hefty steel sak       trashbags  fiberreinforced for your especially sharp or uncooperative waste needs  described by ken e  as  irish guccis   extra resilient and a
businesslike gunmetal gray in tone  lenz has such a panoply of strange compulsive habits that a request for steelsaks barely
raises a brow on anybody 
and then he doubles them  the special reinforced bags  and employs industrial growth pipe cleaners as twist ties  and then
now the grittiest most salutary cats make the doubled bags assume all manners of wickedly abstract twisting shapes  even
sometimes moving the closed bags a couple dozen m  down the alley in a haphazard hopping like fashion  until finally the cat runs
out of gas and resolves itself and lenz s issues into one nightly shape 
lenz s interval of choice for this is the interval   l h  to     h  he doesn t consciously know why this interval  anchovies
turn out to be even more effective than tuna  a program of attraction  he recalls coolly  strolling along  his northern routes back
to the house are restricted by the priority to keep brighton best savings bank s rooftop digital time and temperature display in
view as much as possible  b b s b  displays both est and greenwich mean  which lenz approves of  the liquid crystal data sort
of melts upward into view on the screen and then disappears from the bottom up and is replaced by new data  mr  doony r 
glynn said at the house s community meeting monday once that one time in b s       a d  after he d done a reckless amount of
a hallucinogen he d refer to only as  the madame  he d gone around for several subsequent weeks under a boston sky that instead

 of a kindly curved blue dome with your clouds and your stars and sun was a flat square coldly euclidian grid with black axes and
a thread fine reseau of lines creating grid type coordinates  the whole grid the same color as a d e c  hd viewer screen when the
viewer s off  that sort of dead deepwater gray green  with the dow ticker running up one side of the grid and the nikei index
running down the other  and the time and celsius temp to like serious decimal points flashing along the bottom axis of the sky s
screen  and whenever he d go to a real clock or get a herald and check the like dow the skygrid would turn out to have been
totally accurate  and that several unbroken weeks of this sky overhead had sent glynn off first to his mother s stoneham
apartment s fold out couch and then into waltham s metropolitan state hospital for a month of haldol       and tapioca  to get
out from under the empty grid accurate sky  and says it makes his ass wet to this day to even think about the grid interval  but
lenz had thought it sounded wicked nice  the sky as digital timepiece  and also between      and      the athscme giant
fans off up at the sunstrand plaza within earshot were typically shut off for daily de linting  and it was quiet except for the big
ssshhh of a whole urban city s vehicular traffic  and maybe the odd e w d  airborne deliverer catapulted up off concavityward 
its little string of lights arcing northeast  and of course also sirens  both the eurotrochaic sirens of ambulances and the regular
u s  sounding sirens of the city s very finest  protecting and serving  keeping the citizenry at bay  and the winsome thing about
sirens in the urban night is that unless they re right up close where the lights bathe you in red blue red they always sound like
they re terribly achingly far away  and receding  calling to you across an expanding gap  either that or they re on your ass  no
middle distance with sirens  lenz reflects  walking along and scanning 
glynn hadn t come right out and said euclidian  but lenz had gotten the picture all right  glynn had thin hair and an invariant
three day growth of gray stubble and diverticulitis that made him stoop somewhat over  and remaining physique type issues from
a load of bricks falling on his head from a workers comp scam gone rye that included crossed eyes that lenz overheard the veiled
girl joe l  tell clenette henderson and didi neaves the man was so cross eyed he could stand in the middle of the week and see
both sundays 
lenz has gotten high on organic cocaine two or three  maybe half a dozen times tops  secretly  since he came into ennet
house in the summer  just enough times to keep him from going totally out of his fucking mind  utilizing lines from the private
emergency stash he kept in a kind of rectangular bunker razor bladed out of three hundred or so pages of bill james s gargantuan
large print principles of psychology and the gifford lectures on natural religion  such totally occasional substance ingestions
in a rundown sloppy clocked house where he s cooped up and under terrible stress all day every day  hiding from threats from two
different legal directions  with  upstairs at all times  calling to him  a    gram stash from the under reported south end two way
attempted scam whose very bad luck had forced him into hiding in squalor and rooming with the likes of fucking geoffrey d   
cocaine ingestion this occasional and last resort is such a marked reduction of use   abuse for lenz that it s a bonerfied miracle
and clearly constitutes as much miraculous sobriety as total abstinence would be for another person without lenz s unique
sensitivities and psychological makeup and fucking intolerable daily stresses and difficulty unwinding  and he accepts his monthly
chips with a clear conscience and a head unmuddled by doubting  he knows he s sober  he s smart about it  he s never ingested
cocaine on his solo walks home from meetings  which is where the staff d expect him to ingest if he was going to ingest  and
never in ennet house itself  and only once in the forbidden    across the roadlet  and anybody with half a clue can beat an
e m i t  urine screen  a cup of lemon juice or vinegar down the hatch ll turn the lab s reading into gibberish  a trace of powdered
bleach on the fingertips and let the stream play warmly over the fingertips on its way into the cup while you banter with don g  a
texas catheter s a pain to get piss for and put on  plus the obscene size of the thing s receptacle for his unit gives lenz
inadequacy issues  and he s only used it twice  both times when johnette f  took the urine and he could embarrass her into turning
away  lenz owns a texas cathy from his last halfway house in quincy  in what lenz recalls as the year of the maytag
quietmaster 
and then it turned out  when a cat aggrieved lenz by scratching his wrist in a particularly hostile fashion on the way into the
receptacle  that doubled hefty steelsaks were such quality reinforced products they could hold something razor clawed and
frantically in motion and still survive a direct swung hit against a no parking sign or a telephone pole without splitting open 
even when what was inside split nicely open  and so that technique got substituted around united nations day  because even
though it was too quick and less meditative it allowed randy lenz to take a more active role in the process  and the feeling of
 temporary  nightly  issues resolution was more definitive when lenz could swing a twisting ten kilo burden hard against a pole
and go   there   and hear a sound  on banner nights the doubled bag would continue for a brief period of time to undergo a subtle
flux of smaller  more subtle and connoisseur oriented shapes  even after the melony sound of hard impact  along with further
smaller sounds 
then it was discovered that resolving them directly inside the yards and porches of the people that owned them provided
more adrenal excitation and thus more sense of what bill james one time called a catharsis of resolving  which lenz felt he could
agree  a small can of oil in its own little baggie  for squeaky gates  but because steelsak trashbags   and then also tunafish
mixed with anchovies and raid ant poison from behind the ennet residents  fridge   caused too much resultant noise to allow for
lighting a gasper and hunkering down to meditatively watch  lenz developed the habit of setting the resolution in motion and then
booking on out of the yard into the urban night  his polo topcoat billowing  hurdling fences and running over the hoods of cars and
etc  for a period during the two week interval of give them poison tuna and run lenz had brief recourse to a small caldor brand
squeeze bottle of kerosene  plus of course his lighter  but a wednesday night on which the alight cat ran  as alight cats will  like
hell  but ran after lenz  seemingly  leaping the same fences lenz hurdled and staying on his tail and not only making an
unacceptable attention calling racket but also illuminating lenz to the scopophobic view of passing homes until it finally decided
to drop to the ground and expire and smolder thereupon   lenz considered this his only really close call  and took an enormous
and partly non north route home  with every siren sounding up close and on his personal ass  and barely got in by     h   and ran
right up to the   man room  this was the night lenz had to have another recourse to the hollowed out cavity in his principles of
psychology and the gifford lectures on natural religion after just beating curfew home  which who wouldn t need a bit of an
unwinder after a stressful close call type situation with a flaming cat chasing you and screaming in a way that made porch lights
go on all up and down sumner blake rd   except but instead of an unwinder the couple or few lines of uncut bing proved to be on
this occasion an un unwinder   which happens  sometimes  depending on one s like spiritual condition when ingesting it through

 a rolled dollar bill off the back of the john in the men s can   and lenz barely made it through switching his car s parking spot at
   oh  before the verbal torrent started  and after lights out had only gotten up to age eight in the oral autobiography that
followed in the   man when geoff d  threatened to go get don g  and have lenz forcibly stifled  and lenz was scared to go
downstairs to find somebody to listen and so for the rest of the night he had to lie there in the dark  mute  with his mouth twisting
and writhing   it always twisted and writhed on the times the bing proved to be a rev upper instead of a rough edge smoother  
and pretending to be asleep  with phosphenes like leaping flaming shapes dancing behind his quivering lids  listening to day s
moist gurgles and glynn s apnea and thinking that each siren abroad out there in the urban city was meant for him and coming
closer  with day s illuminated watchface in his fucking tableside drawer instead of out where anybody with some stress and
anxiety could check the time from time to time 
so after the incident with the flaming cat from hell and before halloween lenz had moved on and up to the browning x   
serrated he even had a shoulder holster for  from his previous life out there  the browning x    has a    cm  overall length 
with a burl walnut handle with a brass butt cap and a point lenz d sharpened the clip out of when he got it and a single edge
bowie style blade with    mm  serrations that lenz owns a hone for and tests by dry shaving a little patch of his tan forearm 
which he loves 
the browning x     combined with blocks of don gately s highly portable cornflake garnish meatloaf  were for canines 
which your urban canines tended to be nonferal and could be found within the confinement of their pet owners  fenced yards on a
regularer basis than the urban cat species  and who are less suspicious of food and  though more of a personal injury risk to
approach  do not scratch the hand that feeds them 
for when the dense square of meatloaf is taken out and unwrapped from the zip loc and proffered from the edgelet of yard
out past the fence by the sidewalk  the dog at issue invariably stops with the barking and or lunging and its nose flares and it
becomes totally uncynical and friendly and comes to the end of its chain or the fence lenz stands behind and makes interested
noises and if lenz holds the meat item just up out of reach the dog if its rope or chain will permit it it ll go up on the hind legs and
sort of play the fence with its front paws  jumping eagerly  as lenz dangles the meat 
day had had some recovery issue paperback he was reading that lenz had a look at one p m  in their room when day was
downstairs with ewell and erdedy telling each other their windbagathon stories  lying on day s mattress with his shoes on and
trying to fart into the mattress as much as possible  some line in the book had arrested lenz s attention  something about the more
basically powerless an individual feels  the more the likelihood for the propensity for violent acting out   and lenz found the
observation to be sound 
the only serious challenge to using the browning x    is that lenz has to make sure to get around behind the dog before he
cuts the dog s throat  because the bleeding is far reaching in its intensity  and lenz is now on his second r  lauren topcoat and
third pair of dark wool slacks 
then once near halloween in an alley behind blanchard s liquors off allston s union square lenz comes across a street
drunk in a chewed looking old topcoat in the deserted alley taking a public leak against the side of a dumpster  and lenz
envisualizes the old guy both cut and on fire and dancing jaggedly around hitting at himself while lenz goes  there  but that s as
close as lenz comes to that kind of level of resolution  and it s maybe to his credit that he s a little off his psychic feed for a few
days after that close call  and inactive with pets circa   l h 
lenz has nothing much against his newer fellow resident bruce green  and when one sunday night after the white flag
green asks can he walk along with lenz on the walk back after the our father lenz says whatever and lets green walk with him 
and is inactive during this night s      interval as well  except after a couple nights of green strolling home along with him  first
from the white flag and then from st  columbkill s on tuesday and a double           shot of st  e  s sharing and caring na
and then byp on wed   green following him around like a terrier from mtg  to mtg  and then home  it begins to like emerge on
lenz that bruce g  is starting to treat this walking through the urban p m  with randy lenz thing as like a regular fucking thing 
and lenz starts to jones about it  the unresolved powerless rage issues that the thing is now he s gotten so he s used to resolving
them on a more or less nightly basis  so that being unable to be freely alone to be active with the browning x    or even a
steelsak during the          h  interval causes this pressure to build up like almost a withdrawal grade pressure  but on the
other side of the hand  walking with green has its positive aspects as well  like that green doesn t complain about lengthy detours
to keep a mainly north northeastern orientation to the walks when possible  and lenz enjoys a sympathetic and listening ear to
have around  he has numerous aspects and experiences to mull over and issues to organize and mull  and  like many people
hardwired for organic stimulants  talking is sort of lenz s way of thinking  and but most of the ears of the other residents at ennet
house are not only unsympathetic but are attached to great gaping flapping oral mouths which keep horning into the conversation
with the mouths  own opinions and issues and aspects   most of the residents are the worst listeners lenz has ever seen  bruce
green  on the hand s positive side  hardly says anything  bruce green is quiet the way certain stand up type guys you want to have
there with you beside you if a beef starts going down are quiet  like self contained  yet green is not so quiet and unresponding
that it s like with some silent people where you start to wonder if he s listening with a sympathizing ear or if he s really drifting
around in his own self oriented thoughts and not even listening to lenz  etc   treating lenz like a radio you can tune in or out 
lenz has a keen antenna for people like this and their stock is low on his personal exchange  bruce green inserts low affirmatives
and  no shit s and  fucking a s  etc   at just the right places to communicate his attentions to lenz  which lenz admires 
so it s not like lenz just wants to blow green off and tell him to go peddle his papers and let him the fuck alone after
meetings so he can solo  it would have to be handled in a more diplomatic fashion  plus lenz finds himself nervous at the
prospect of offending green  it s not like he s scared of green in terms of physically  and it s not like he s concerned green would
be the ewell  or day type you have to stressfully worry about maybe going and ratting out on lenz s place of whereabouts to the
finest and everything like that  green has a strong air of non rat about him which lenz admires  so it s not like he s frightened to
blow green off  it s more like very tense and tightly wound 
plus it agitates lenz that he has the feeling that it really wouldn t be any big deal to green that much one way or the other 
and that lenz feels like he s spending all this stress tensely worrying about his side of something that green would barely think
about for more than a couple seconds  and it enrages lenz that he can know in his head that the tense worry about how to

 diplomatize green into leaving him alone is unnecessary and a waste of time and tension and yet still not be able to stop worrying
about it  which all only increases the sense of powerlessness that lenz is impotent to resolve with his browning and meatloaf as
long as green continues to walk home with him 
and the schizoid cats with clotted fur that lurk around ennet house cringing and neurotic and afraid of their own shadow are
too risky  for the female residents are always formulating attachments to them  and pat m  s golden retrievers would be
tattlemount to legal suicide  on a saturday c     lh   lenz found a miniature bird that had fallen out of some nest and was sitting
bald and pencil necked on the lawn of unit    flapping ineffectually  and went in with green and ducked green and went back
outside to    s lawn and put the thing in a pocket and went in and put it down the garbage disposal in the kitchen sink of the
kitchen  but still felt largely impotent and unresolved 
except for pat montesian s bay windowed front office and the house manager s phone booth sized back office and the two
live in staff bedrooms down in the basement  none of the doors inside ennet house have locks  for predictable reasons

late p m   monday   november year of the depend adult undergarment
for reasons that pemulis couldn t for the life of him  ortho stice seemed to be in there in dr  dolores rusk s office 
interfacing with dr  rusk well after regular hours  pemulis paused at the door on his way by 
   nical assessment  after our work together on your fear of weights  would be that your presenting maladjustment  ortho 
like many males and athletes  is that you re suffering from counterphobia  

  fear of linoleum   it was unmistakably the flat twang of the darkness in there through the door s wood 
 on the level of objects and a projective infantile omnipotence where you experience magical thinking about your thoughts
and the behavior of objects  relation to your narcissistic wishes  the counterphobia presents as the delusion of some special agency
or control to compensate for some repressed wounded inner trauma having to do with absence of control  
 over linoleum  
 my suggestion might be to forget linoleum and objects in general  in for instance an analytic model  the types of traumas
counterphobic reactions cover are almost always pre oedipal  at which stage objects  cathexis is oedipal and symbolic  for
example small children s dolls and action figurines  
 i don t play with no goddamn action figurines  
 gi joe typically being cathected as an image of the potent but antagonistic father  the  military  man  with  gi  representing
at once the  general issue  of a  weapon  the oedipal child both covets and fears and a well known medical acronym for the
gastro intestinal tract  with all the attendant anal anxieties that require repression in the oedipal phase s desire to control the
bowels in order to impress or quote  win  the mother  of whom the barbie might be seen as the most obviously reductive and
phallocentric reduction of the mother to an archetype of sexual function and availability  the barbie as image of the oedipal
mother as image  
 so you re saying i m overestimating objects  
 i m saying there s a very young ortho in there with some very real abandonment issues who needs some nurturing and
championing from the older ortho instead of indulging in fantasies of omnipotence  
 i ain t omnipotent and i don t want to x no goddamn barbiedoll   then dark s voice went way up and cracked as he said
something about his bed 
dr  rusk s office door had a nonconducting rubberized sheath on the knob  and dr  rusk s name and degrees and title  and a
needlepoint sampler with a little heart inside a big heart and a cursive exhortation to champion an inner child today  which the
little kids at e t a  find puzzling and upsetting  pemulis  pausing by habit first at the silent locked infirmary door and then rusk s
bottom crack lit door on his way across the comm  ad  lobby  was wearing the most insolent ensemble he could throw together 
he wore maroon paratrooper s pants with green stovepipe stripes down the sides  the pants  cuffs were tucked into fuchsia socks
above ancient and radically uncool clark s wallabies with dirty soles of eraserish gum  he wore an orange fake silk turtleneck
under an english cut sportcoat in a purple and tan windowpane check  he wore naval shoulder braid at the level of ensign  he
wore his yachting cap  but with the bill bent up at a bumpkinish angle  he looked less insolent than just extremely poorly dressed 
really  dr  rusk s door was cool against his ear  jim troeltsch had been coming down b s hall just as pemulis was leaving and
said pemulis looked like a hangover  through the door  rusk was urging stice to name his anger and stice was proposing to name
his anger horace after his old man s late pointer that had got into some coyote bait when the darkness was nine and was much
missed by the whole stice brood  back in kansas  the old wallabies were from pemulis s older brother s incomplete public school
career and had boogerish little greebles of dirty gum all around the soles  perimeter  the socks belonged to jennie bash and she
made it explicit she wanted them back laundered  the sportcoat s checked arms were several cm  too short and exposed ribbed
cuffs of shiny orange acetate esters 
the community   administration bldg  s downstairs was real quiet  it was like     h   supposedly mandatory study period 
and harde s crew had gone home but the custodial graveyard shift hadn t come on yet  pemulis moved noiselessly ne sw across
the lobby s shag  except for lines of lamplight from under a couple doors the e t a  lobby was pitch black  and the outer
academy doors locked  there was an odd vehicular shape near the north wall s trophy case that pemulis didn t pause to
investigate  he lifted up slightly to keep the little sw hall s door from squeaking as he opened it and entered the administrative
reception area  snapping his fingers softly to himself  a loose music played in his head  tavis s reception area was empty and dim 
the wallpaper s clouds now stormy dark  it wasn t totally quiet  light came from mrs  inc s doorway and from the crack under
tavis s inner door  lateral alice moore had gone home  pemulis activated her third rail and played with her chair as he made a
very quick survey of the material on her desk  activating the p a  mike was out of all question  two of her five drawers were still
locked  pemulis scanned behind him and popped another breath mint and sat quietly for a moment as moore s chair slid back and
forth along the rail  his fingers in a steeple under his nose  considering 
light shone from the crack of tavis s inner door because the outer door stood open  pemulis didn t even have to put any kind
of ear to the wood of the inside door  he could hear the hiss and high speed grind of ta vis s stair laster  and ta vis s breathless
recessive voice  you could tell there was nobody else in there  you could tell tavis had no shirt on and an e t a  towel around
his neck and his hair a sweaty curtain down one side of his little head as he ran to keep up with what reminded everybody of a
satanishly possessed filene s escalator  he was exhorting himself in a kind of fast rhythmic chant that sounded to pemulis like
either total worry total worry  or  no don t worry no don t worry  and c  pemulis could envision tavis s round belly and little titties
of fat bouncing with the action of the stair laster  you could hear the sudden muffling when he probably brought the towel up to
dab at his slanted mustache  tavis s doorknob had no insulating rubber sheath  pemulis noticed 
pemulis s ensemble s belt was a plastic thing with chintzy fake navajo beading  purchased by little chip sweeny at one of last
fall s whata urger s souvenir stands and subsequently transferred to pemulis during a big buddy tennis as game of chance
exercise  the beading patterns were in gila monster orange and black  the orange a different shade than pemulis s tur tleneck 
he could never resist biting down once a mint d melted to a certain size and texture 
the doorless dean of academic affairs s office was a blazing rectangle of light  the light didn t spill very far into the
reception area  however  at close range  sounds issued from the office  but not exactly words  pemulis checked his fly and
snapped his fingers under his own nose and assumed a businesslike stride and rapped firmly on the doorless jamb without
breaking stride  the heavier blue shag of the office itself slowed him down a bit  he stopped once he was all the way in     a
john wayne and hal s mumsly wumsly were both in the front of the office  they were about maybe two meters apart  the room
was lit overhead and by four standing lamps  the seminar table and chairs cast a complicated shadow  two homemade pompoms
of shredded paper and what looked like the amputated handles of wooden tennis racquets were on the seminar table  which was

 otherwise bare  john wayne wore a football helmet and light shoulderpads and a russell athletic supporter and socks and shoes
and nothing else  he was down in the classic three point stance of u s  football  inc s incredibly tall and well preserved mother
dr  avril incandenza wore a little green and white cheerleader s outfit and had one of delint s big brass whistles hanging around
her neck  she was blowing on the whistle  which appeared to be minus the little inside pellet because no whistling sound resulted 
she was about two meters from wayne  facing him  doing near splits on the heavy shag  one arm up and pretending to blow the
whistle while wayne produced the classic low register growling sounds of u s  football  pemulis made rather a show of pushing
the bumpkin billed yachting hat back to scratch his head  blinking  mrs  inc was the only one looking at him 
 i probably won t even waste everybody s time asking if i m interrupting   pemulis said 
mrs  inc seemed frozen in place  her one hand was still up in the air  fine fingers splayed  wayne craned his neck to look
over at pemulis from under his helmet without changing his three point stance  the football noises trailed off  wayne s got a
narrow nose and close set witchy eyes  he wore a plastic mouthguard  the musculature of his legs and buttocks was clearly
outlined as he squatted forward with his weight on his knuckles  there was way less time passing in the office than there seemed
to be 
 hoping for a second of your time   pemulis told mrs  inc  he was standing schoolboy straight  hands clasped demurely over
his fly  which on pemulis this posture did look insolent 
wayne straightened up and moved toward his clothing with no little dignity  his sweats were neatly folded on the dean s desk
at the rear of the office  the mouthguard was attached to the facemask and hung from it when removed  the chin strap had several
snaps wayne had to undo 
 nice looking helmet   pemulis told him 
wayne  pulling hard on his sweatpants  cuffs to fit them over a shoe  didn t reply  he was so fit that his supporter s straps
didn t even dent his buttocks 
mrs  incandenza removed the mute whistle  she was still split down on the floor  pemulis made rather a show of not looking
south of her face  she pursed her lips to chuff hair out of her eyes 
 i predict this ll take about two minutes at most   pemulis said  smiling 

wednesday    november year of the depend adult undergarment
lenz wears a worsted topcoat and dark slacks and brazilian loafers with a high wattage shine and a disguise that makes him
look like andy warhol with a tan  bruce green wears a cheesy off the rack leather jacket of stiff cheap leather that makes the
jacket creak when he breathes 
 this is when you man this is when you find out your like what like true character  is when it s pointed right at you and some
bugeyed fucking spic s not five mitts       away pointing it  and i strangely i get real calm see and said i said pepito i said i
pepito man you go on and do what you need to do man go on and shoot but man you better i mean fucking better kill me with the
first shot man or you won t get another one i said  not even bullshitting man i m serious it s like i found right then i meant it  you
know what i m saying   green lights both their smokes  lenz exhales with that hiss of people in a rush to drive their point home 
 you know what i m saying  
 i don t know  
it s an urban november p m   very last leaves down  dry gray hairy grass  brittle bushes  gap toothed trees  the rising moon
looks like it doesn t feel very well  the click of lenz s loafers and the crunchy thud of green s old asphalt spreader s boots with
the thick black soles  green s little noises of attention and assent  he says he s been broken by life  is all he ll personally say 
green  life has kicked his ass  and he s regrouping  lenz likes him  and there s always this slight hangnail of fear  like clinging 
whenever he likes somebody  it s like something terrible could happen at any time  less fear than a kind of tension in the region of
stomach and ass  an all body wince  deciding to go ahead and think somebody s a stand up guy  it s like you drop something  you
give up all of your power over it  you have to stand there impotent waiting for it to hit the ground  all you can do is brace and
wince  it kind of enrages lenz to like somebody  there would be no way to say any of this out loud to green  as it gets past
  ooh  and the meatloaf in his pocket s baggie s gotten dark and hard from disuse the pressure to exploit the c       interval for
resolution builds to a terrible pitch  but lenz still can t yet quite get it up to ask green to walk back some other way at least once
in a while  how does he do it and still have green know he thinks he s ok  but you don t come right out there and let somebody
hear you say you think they re ok  when it s a girl you re just trying to x it s a different thing  straightforwarder  but like for
instance where do you look with your eyes when you tell somebody you like them and mean what you say  you can t look right at
them  because then what if their eyes look at you as your eyes look at them and you lock eyes as you re saying it  and then there d
be some awful like voltage or energy there  hanging between you  but you can t look away like you re nervous  like some nervous
kid asking for a date or something  you can t go around giving that kind of thing of yourself away  plus the knowing that the
whole fucking thing s not worth this kind of wince and stress  the whole thing s enraging  the afternoon of tonight earlier at circa
    h  lenz d sprayed rijid brand male hairspray in the face of a one eyed ennet house stray cat that had wandered by
mischance into the men s head upstairs  but the result  unsatisfying  the cat had just run away downstairs  clunking into the
bannister only once  lenz then got diarrhea  which always disgusts him  and he had to stay in the head and open the little warped
frosted glass window and run the shower on c until the smell s evidence cleared  with fucking glynn pounding on the door and attracting attention howling about who s flailing the whale in there all this time is it by any chance lenz  but then how would he be
supposed to act henceforward toward green if he blows him off and says to let him walk solo home  how would he be supposed
to act if it d seemed like he d like spurned green  what does he henceforward say if he and green pass each other in the aisle at
saturday night lively or both reach for the same sandwich at the raffle break at white flag  or get caught standing there halfnaked in towels in the hall waiting for somebody to get out of the shower  what if he like spurns green and green ends up in the
  man room while lenz is still in there and they have to room together and interface constantly  and if lenz tries to temper the
spurning by telling green he likes him  where the fuck is he supposed to look when he says it  if trying to x a female species
lenz would have nullo problemo with where to look  he d have no problem with looking deep into some bitch s eyes and looking

 so sincere it s like he s dying inside him  or if like assuring a bad complected brazilian he hadn t stepped on a half kilo three
separate times with ino sitol        or if high  zero problem  if he got high  he d have no problem telling somebody he liked him
even if he really did  for it d give his spirits a voltage that d more than overweigh whatever upsetting voltage might hang in the air
between somebody  a few lineskers and there d be no stress issues about telling bruce g  with all due respects to screw  go peddle
his papers  go play in the freeway  go play with a chain saw  go find a short pier  that no disrespect but lenz needed to fly solo in
the urban night  so after the incident with the cat and diarrhea and some hard words with d  r  glynn  who was slumped holding
his abdomen down against the south wall of the upstairs hall  lenz decides enough is enough and goes and gets a little square of
foil off the industrial roll don g  keeps under the ennet sink and goes and takes a half gram  maybe a gram at most out of the
emergency stash out of the vault thing he s razored out of the principles of natural lectures  far from your scenario of relapsing 
the bing is medicinal support for assertively sharing his need for aloneness with green  so that issues of early sobriety can get
resolved before standing in the way of spiritual growth   lenz will use cocaine in the very interests of sobriety and growth itself 
so then like strategically  at the brookline young people s mtg  over on beacon near the newton line on a wednesday  at the
raffle break  at     h   lenz moistens his half gasper and puts it carefully back in the pack and yawns and stretches and does a
quick pulse check and gets up and saunters casually into the handicapped head with the lockable door and the big sort of crib
built around the shitter itself for crippled lowering onto the toilet and does like maybe two  maybe three generous lines of bing off
the top of the toilet tank and wipes the tank top off both before and after with wet paper towels  ironically rolling up the same
crisp buck he d brought for the meeting s collection and utilizing it and cleaning it thoroughly with his finger and rubbing his gums
with the finger and then putting his head way back in the mirror to check the kidney shaped nostrils of his fine aqua line nose for
clinging evidence in the trim hair up there and tasting the bitter drip in the back of his frozen throat and taking the clean rolled
buck and back rolling it and smoothing it out and hammering it with his fist on the lip of the sink and folding it neatly into half of
half its original treasury dept  size so that all evidence anybody ever even had a passing thought of rolling the buck into a hard
tight tube is  like  anileated  then sauntered back out like butter wouldn t soften anywhere on his body  knowing just where to
look at all times and casually hefting his balls before he sat back down 
and then aside from the every so often hemispasm of the mouth and right eye he hides via the old sunglasses and pretendcough tactic the second half of the mtg  s endless oratory goes fine  he supposes  even though he did smoke almost a whole
expensive pack of gaspers in    minutes  and the holier than you young people aas over in what were supposed to be the
nonsmoking rows of chairs against the east wall to his right shot him over some negative type looks when perchance he happened
to find he had one going in the little tin ashtray and two at once going in his mouth  but lenz was able to play the whole thing off
with insousistent aplomb  sitting there in his aviator sunglasses with his legs crossed and his topcoated arms resting out along the
backs of the empty chairs on either side 
the night noises of the metro night  harbor wind skirling on angled cement  the shush and sheen of overpass traffic  tps 
laughter in interior rooms  the yowl of unresolved cat life  horns blatting off in the harbor  receding sirens  confused inland
gulls  cries  broken glass from far away  car horns in gridlock  arguments in languages  more broken glass  running shoes  a
woman s either laugh or scream from who can tell how far  coming off the grid  dogs defending whatever dog yards they pass by 
the sounds of chains and risen hackles  the podiatric click and thud  the visible breath  gravel s crunch  creak of green s leather 
the snick of a million urban lighters  the gauzy far off humming athscmes pointing out true plumb north  the clunk and tinkle
of stuff going into dumpsters and rustle of stuff in dumpsters settling and skirl of wind on the sharp edges of dumpsters and
unmistakable clanks and tinkles of dumpster divers and can miners going after dumpsters  cans and bottles  the district
redemption center down in west brighton and actually even boldly sharing a storefront with liquor world liquor store  so the
can miners can do like one stop redeeming and shopping  which lenz finds repellent to the maximus  and shares the feelings with
green  lenz observes to green how myriadly ironic are the devices by which the famous crooner s promise to clean up our
urban cities has come to be kept  the noises parallaxing in from out over the city s winking grid  at night  the wooly haze of
monoxides  you got your faint cuntstink of the wind off the bay  planes  little crucifi of landing lights well ahead of their own
noise  crows in trees  you got your standard crepuscular rustles  ground floors  lit windows laying little rugs of light out into their
lawns  porch lights that go on automatically when you stroll by  a threnody of sirens somewhere north of the charles  bare trees
creaking in the wind  the state bird of massachusetts  he shares to green  is the police siren  to project and to swerve  the cries
and screams from out across who knows how many blocks  who knows the screams  intent  sometimes the end of the scream is at
the sound of the start of the scream  he opines  the visible breath and the rainbowed rings of streetlights and headlights through
that breath  unless the screams are really laughing  lenz s own mother s laugh had sounded like she was being eaten alive 
except   after the maybe five total lines hoovered in a totally purposive medicinal nonrecreational spirit   except then
instead of assuring green he s a blue chip commodity on lenz s exchange but to please screw and let lenz stroll home solo with
his meatloaf and agenda  it eventuates that lenz has again miscalculated the effect the bing s hydrolysis       will have  he
always like previsions the effect as cool nonchalant verbal sangfroid  but instead lenz on the way home finds himself under huge
hydrolystic compulsion to have green right there by his side   or basically anyone who can t get away or won t go away   right
there with him  and to share with green or any compliant ear pretty much every experience and thought he s ever had  to give each
datum of the case of r  lenz shape and visible breath as his whole life  and then some  tear asses across his mind s arctic horizon 
trailing phosphenes 
he tells green that his phobic fear of timepieces stems from his stepfather  an amtrak train conductor with deeply unresolved
issues which he used to make lenz wind his pocketwatch and polish his fob daily with a chamois cloth and nightly make sure his
watch s displayed time was correct to the second or else he d lay into the pint sized randy with a rolled up copy of track and
flange  a slick and wicked heavy coffee table sized trade periodical 
lenz tells green how spectacularly obese his own late mother had been  using his arms to dramatically illustrate the
dimensions involved 
he breathes between about every third or fourth fact  ergo about once a block 
lenz tells green the plots of several books he s read  confabulating them 
lenz doesn t notice the way green s face sort of crumples blankly when lenz mentions the issue of late mothers 

 lenz euphorically tells green how he once got the tip of his left finger cut off in a minibike chain once and how but within
days of intensive concentration the finger had grown back and regenerated itself like a lizard s tail  confounding doctoral
authorities  lenz says that was the incident in youth after which he got in touch with his own unusual life force and energois de
vivre and knew and accepted that he was somehow not like the run of common men  and began to accept his uniqueness and all
that it entailed 
lenz clues green in on it s a myth the nile crocodile is the most dreaded species of crocodile  that the dreaded estuarial
crocodile of saltwater habits is a billion times more dreaded by those in the know 
lenz theorizes that his compulsive need to know the time with microspic precision is also a function of his stepfather s
dysfunctional abuse regarding the pocketwatch and track and flange  this segues into an analysis of the term dysfunction and its
revelance to the distinctions between  say  psychology and natural religion 
lenz tells how once in the back bay on boylston outside bonwit s a pushy prosthesis vendor gave him a hard time about a
glass eye item of jewelry and got his issues  juices flowing and then down the prosthesis vendor line another vendor simply would
not take no of any sort about a bottle of a d a  approved xero lube saliva substitute with a confabulated celeb endorsement
from j  gentle f  crooner on it and lenz utilized akido to break the man s nose with one blow and then drive the bone s shards and
fragments up into the vendor s brain with the follow up heel of his hand  a maneuver known by a secret ancient chinese term
meaning the old one two  eliminating the saliva guy s map on the spot  so that lenz had learned about the lethality of his
whatever was beyond black belt in akido and his hands  deadliness as weapons when his issues were provoked and tells green
how he d taken a solemn vow right there  running like hell down boylston for the auditorium t stop to evade prosecution  vowed
never to use his lethally adept akido skills except in the most compulsory situation of defending the innocent and or weak 
lenz tells green how once he was at a halloween party where a hydro cephalic woman wore a necklace made of dead gulls 
lenz shares about this recurving dream where he s seated under a tropical ceiling fan in a cane chair wearing an l l  bean
safari hat and holding a wickerware valise in his lap  and that s all  and that s the recurving dream 
on the     block of w  beacon  around   o h   lenz demonstrates for bruce green the secret akido     with which he d
demapped the saliva monger  breaking the move down into slo mo constituent movements so that green s untrained eye could
follow  he says there s another recurving nightmare about a clock with hands frozen eternally at      that s so trouser foulingly
scary he won t even burden green s fragile psychology with the explicits of it 
green  lighting both their smokes  says he either doesn t remember his dreams or doesn t dream 
lenz adjusts his white toupee and mustache in a darkened interlace outlet s window  does the odd bit of t ai chi stretching 
and blows his nose into w  beacon s cluttered gutter euro style  one nostril at a time  arching to keep his coatfront well back from
what he expels 
green s one of these muscle shirt types that carries his next gasper tucked up over his ear  which the use of rijid or other
brands of quality hair fixative makes impossible for the reason that residues of spray on the cigarette cause it to burst
unexpectedly into flame at points along its length  lenz regales how at that halloween party with the necklace of birds there d
been allegedly a concavity refugee infant there  at the party  at the home of a south boston orthodontist that dealt lidocaine to
bing retailers on the prescriptional dicky        a normal size and unferal infant but totally without a skull  lying in a kind of
raised platform or dais by the fireplace with its shapeless and deskulled head region supported and  like  shuddering   contained in
a sort of lidless plastic box  and its eyes were sunk way down in its face  which was the consistency of like quicksand  the face 
and its nose concave and its mouth hanging out over either side of the boneless face  and the total head had like conformed to the
inside of the containing box it was contained in  the head  and appeared roughly square in overall outline  the head  and the
woman with the lei of gull heads and other persons in costumes had ingested hallucinogens and drank mescal and ate the little
worms in the mescal and had performed circled rituals around the box and platform around     h   worshipping the infant  or as
they termed it simply the infant  as if there were only one 
green lets lenz know the time at roughly two minute intervals  maybe once a block  from his cheap but digital watch  when
the critical b b s b  liquid crystal sign is obscured by the urban night s strolling skyline 
lenz s labial writhing occurs worst on diphthongs involving o sounds 
lenz clues green in that aa na works all right but there s no fucking question it s a cult  he and green ve apparently got
themselves to the point where the only way out of the addictive tailspin is to enlist in a fucking cult and let them try and brainwash
your ass  and that the first person tries to lay a saffron robe or tambourine on lenz is going to be one very sorry cableyar row
indeed  is all 
lenz claims to remember some experiences which he says happened to him in vitro 
lenz says the ennet graduates who often come back and take up living room space sitting around comparing horror stories
about former religious cults they d tried joining as part of their struggle to try to quit with the drugs and alcohol are not w o a
certain naive charm but are basically naive  lenz details that robes and mass weddings and head shaving and pamphleteering in
airports and selling flowers on median strips and signing away inheritances and never sleeping and marrying whoever they tell
you and then never seeing who you marry are small potatoes in terms of bizarre cult criterion  lenz tells green he knows
individuals who ve heard shit that would blow green s mind out his ear sockets 
at lunchtime  hal incandenza was lying on his bunk in bright sunlight through the window with his hands laced over his
chest  and jim troeltsch poked his head in and asked hal what he was doing  and hal told him photosynthesizing and then didn t
say anything else until troeltsch went away 
then     breaths later  michael pemulis stuck his head in where troeltsch s had been 
 did you eat yet  
hal made his stomach bulge up and patted it  still looking at the ceiling   the beast has killed and gorged and now lies in the
shade of the baobob tree  
 gotcha  
 surveying his loyal pride  
 i gotcha  

 over     breaths later  john   n r    wayne opened up the ajar door a little more and put his whole head in and stayed like
that  with just his head in  he didn t say anything and hal didn t say anything  and they stayed like that for a while  and then
wayne s head smoothly withdrew 
under a streetlamp on faneuil st  off w  beacon  randy lenz shares a vulnerable personal thing and tilts his head back to
show bruce green where his septum used to be 
randy lenz reguiles bruce green about certain real estate cults in s  cal  and the west coast  of delawareans that still
believed virtual reality pornography even though it d been found to cause bleeding from the eye corners and real world
permanent impotence was still the key to shrangi la and believed that some sort of perfect piece of digito holographic porn was
circulating somewhere in the form of a bootleg write protect notched software diskette and devoted their cultic lives to snuffling
around trying to get hold of the virtual kamasupra diskette and getting together in dim wilmington area venues and talking very
obliquely about rumors of where and just what the software was and how their snufflings for it were going  and watching virtual
fuckfilms and mopping the corner of their eyes  etc  or of something called stelliform cultism that bruce green isn t even near
ready to hear about  lenz opines  or like e g  of a suicidal nuck cult of nucks that worshipped a form of russian roulette that
involved jumping in front of trains and seeing which nuck could come the closest to the train s front without getting demapped 
what sounds like lenz chewing gum is really lenz trying to talk and grind his teeth together at the same time 
lenz recalls orally that his stepfather s blue vested gut had preceded the conductor into rooms by several seconds  fob glinting
above the watch pocket s sinister slit  how lenz s mother back in fall river had made it a point of utilizing greyhound for
voyages and sojourns  basically to piss her stephusband off 
lenz discusses how a serious disadvantage to dealing bing retail is the way customers ll show up pounding on your door at
     sporting lint in the terms of resources and putting their arms around your shins and ankles and begging for just a half gram
or tenth of a gram and offering to give lenz their kids  like lenz wants to fucking deal with anybody s kids  which these scenes
were always constant drags on his spirits 
green  who s hoovered his share  says cocaine always seemed like it grabbed you by the throat and just didn t let go  and he
could relate to why the boston aas call bing the  express elevator to aa  
in a dumpster lined easement between faneuil st  and brighton ave   brighton  right after green almost steps in what he s
pretty sure is human vomit  lenz proves logically why it s all too likely that ennet house resident geoffrey d  is a closet poofta 
lenz reports how he s been approached in the past to male model and act  but that the male model and acting profession is
pretty much crawling with your closet pooftas  and it s no kind of work for a man that s confronted the ins and outs of his own
character 
lenz speculates openly on how there are purportaged to be whole packs and herds of feral animals operating in locust like
fashion in the rhythmic lushness of parts of the great concavity to the due northeast  descended reputedly from domestic pets and
abandoned during the relocational transition to an o n a n ite map  and how teams of pro researchers and amateur explorers and
intrepid hearts and cultists have ventured northeast of checkpoints along the lucited athscmulated walls and never returned 
vanishing in toto from the short wave e m  bands  as in like dropping off the radar 
green turns out to have no conceptions or views on the issues of fauna of the concavity at all  he literally says he s never
given it one thought one way or the other 
whole nne cults and stelliform subcults lenz reports as existing around belief systems about the metaphysics of the
concavity and annular fusion and b s      s b cartridge type radiation affected fauna and overfertiliza tion and verdant forests
with periodic oasises of purportaged desert and whatever east of the former montpelier vt area of where the annulated shawshine
river feeds the charles and tints it the exact same tint of blue as the blue on boxes of hefty steelsaks and the ideas of ravacious
herds of feral domesticated housepets and oversized insects not only taking over the abandoned homes of relocated americans but
actually setting up house and keeping them in model repair and impressive equity  allegedly  and the idea of infants the size of
prehistoric beasts roaming the overfertilized east concavity quadrants  leaving enormous scat piles and keening for the abortive
parents who d left or lost them in the general geopolitical shuffle of mass migration and really fast packing  or  as some of your
more limbaugh era type cultists sharingly believe  originating from abortions hastily disposed of in barrels in ditches that got
breached and mixed ghastly contents with other barrels that reanimated the abortive fed and brought them to a kind of repelsive
oversized b cartridge life thundering around due north of where yrstruly and green strolled through the urban grid  of one local
underground stelliform offshoot from the bob hope worshipping rastafarians who smoked enormous doobsters and wove their
negroid hair into clusters of wet cigars like the rastafarians but instead of rastafarians these post rastas worshipped the infant
and every new year donned tie dyed parkas and cardboard snowshoes and ventured northward  trailing smoke  past the walls and
fans of checkpoint pongo into the former areas of vt and nh  seeking the infant they called it  as if there were only one  and
toting paraphernalia for performing a cultish ritual referred to in oblique tones only as propitiating the infant  whole posses of
these stelliform pot head reggae swaying infant cultists disappearing forever off the human race s radar every winter  never heard
or smelled again  regarded by fellow cultists as martyrs and or lambs  possibly too addled by blimp sized doobsters to find their
way back out of the concavity and freezing to death  or en swarmed by herds of feral pets  or shot by property value conscious
insects  or      face plum colored  finally breathing  worse 
lenz shudders just at the thought of the raging powerlessness he d feel  he shares  lost and disorientated  wandering in circles
in blinding white frozen points due north of all domesticated men  forget the time not even knowing what fucking date it was  his
breath an ice beard  with just his tinder and wits and character to live by  armed just with a browning blade 
green opines that if boston aa is a cult that like brainwashes you  he guesses he d got himself to the point where his brain
needed a good brisk washing  which lenz knows is not an original view  being exactly what big blockheaded don gately repeats

said he used to wear a four piece suit and the fourth piece was him  
 an allston group guy says that all the time  that joke  
 he had on a real nice white thick weave cotton shirt opened at the throat and wheat colored pants and loafers without socks 
which i m up here ten years don and i still can t follow this thing up here about y all all wearing nice shoes and then wrecking
them by wearing them without socks  
 joelle  you re maybe about the last person to be taking somebody s inventory about weird ways they dress  under there 
maybe  
 kiss my rosy red ass  maybe  
 remind me to log how it s real positive to see you coming out of this shell of yours

 erdedy s a community pillar  i got to stay in here with the phone  maybe you could tell geoff and nell to like waltz on in if
they can take time out from torturing the new people

 i don t care what the sick bastard told you  yolanda  getting on your knees in the a m  to ask for help does not mean
getting on your knees in the a m  while this sick yutz stands in front of you and unzips his fly and you ask for help into his fly

 this is a nomonous program  you know what i m saying  
 jesus  kid  
orin   o    incandenza stands embracing a putatively swiss hand model in a rented room  they embrace  their faces become
sexual faces  it seems clear evidence of a kind of benign fate or world spirit that this incredible specimen had appeared at sky
harbor int  airp  just as orin stood with his fine forehead against the glass of the gate overlooking the tarmac after actually
volunteering to drive helen steeply all the nightmarish way down i        to the ghastly glittering unnavigable airport and the
subject seemed  in the car  not only not especially grateful  and hadn t let him so much as place a friendly and supportive palm on
her incredible quadricep during the ride  but had been irritatingly all business and had continued to pursue lines of family linen
inquiry he d all but begged her to quit subjecting him to the inappropriateness of         that  as he stood there after having
received little other than a cool smile and a promise to try to say hello to hallie  with his forehead against the glass of the weston
back door   or rather the delta gate window   this incredible specimen had   unbidden  unstrategized   come up to him and
started a lush foreign accented conversation and revealed professionally lovely hands as she rooted in her tripolymer bag to ask
him to autograph for her toddler age son a cardinal souvenir football she had right there     in her bag  along with her swiss
passport   as if the universe were reaching out a hand to pluck him from the rim of the abyss of despair that any real sort of
rejection or frustration of his need for some subject he d picked out always threatened him with  as if he d been teetering with his
arms windmilling at a great height without even idiotic red wings strapped to his back and the universe were sending this lovely
steadying left hand to pull him gently back and embrace him and not so much console him as remind him of who and what he was
about  standing there embracing a subject with a sexual face for his sexual face  no longer speaking  the football and pen on the
neatly made bed  the two of them embracing between the bed and the mirror with the woman facing the bed so that orin can see
past her head the large hanging mirror and the small framed photos of her swiss family arrayed along the wood grain dresser
below the window        the tubby faced man and swiss looking kids all smiling trustingly into a nothing somewhere up and to
their right 
they have shifted into a sexual mode  her lids flutter  his close  there s a concentrated tactile languor  she is left handed  it is
not about consolation  they start the thing with each other s buttons  it is not about conquest or forced capture  it is not about
glands or instincts or the split second shiver and clench of leaving yourself  nor about love or about whose love you deep down
desire  by whom you feel betrayed  not and never love  which kills what needs it  it feels to the punter rather to be about hope  an
immense  wide as the sky hope of finding a something in each subject s fluttering face  a something the same that will propitiate
hope  somehow  pay its tribute  the need to be assured that for a moment he has her  now has won her as if from someone or
something else  something other than he  but that he has her and is what she sees and all she sees  that it is not conquest but
surrender  that he is both offense and defense and she neither  nothing but this one second s love of her  of her  spinning as it arcs
his way  not his but her love  that he has it  this love  his shirt off now  in the mirror   that for one second she loves him too much
to stand it  that she must  she feels  have him  must take him inside or else dissolve into worse than nothing  that all else is gone 
that her sense of humor is gone  her petty griefs  triumphs  memories  hands  career  betrayals  the deaths of pets   that there is
now inside her a vividness vacuumed of all but his name  o   o  that he is the one 
 this is why  maybe  one subject is never enough  why hand after hand must descend to pull him back from the endless fall 
for were there for him just one  now  special and only  the one would be not he or she but what was between them  the
obliterating trinity of you and i into we  orin felt that once and has never recovered  and will never again  
and about contempt  it is about a kind of hatred  too  along with the hope and need  because he needs them  needs her 
because he needs her he fears her and so hates her a little  hates all of them  a hatred that comes out disguised as a contempt he
disguises in the tender attention with which he does the thing with her buttons  touches the blouse as if it too were part of her  and
him  as if it could feel  they have stripped each other neatly  her mouth is glued to his mouth  she is his breath  his eyes shut
against the sight of hers  they are stripped in the mirror and she  in a kind of virtuoso jitterbug that is      new world  uses o  s
uneven shoulders as support to leap and circle his neck with her legs  and she arches her back and is supported  her weight  by just
one hand at the small of her back as he bears her to bed as would a waiter a tray 
 hoompf  
 herrmmp  
 well in excess of a thousand pardons for my collision  
 arslanian  is that you  
 it is i  idris arslanian  who is this other  
 it s ted schacht  id  why the blindfold  
 where have i come  please  i became disoriented upon a set of stairs  i became panicked  i nearly removed my blindfold 
where are we  i detect many odors  
 you re just off the weight room  in the little hall off the tunnel that isn t the little hall that goes to the sauna  why the
blindfold  though  
 and the origin of this sound of hysterical weeping and moans  this is    
 it s anton doucette in there  he s in there clinically depressed  lyle s trying to buck him up  some of the crueler guys are in
there watching like it s entertainment  i got disgusted  somebody in pain isn t entertainment  i did my sets  now i m a vapor trail  
 you exude vapor  

  always nice running into you  id  
 await  please conduct me upstairs or into the locker for a lavatory visit  the blindfold i am wearing is experimental on the
part of thorp  you are told of the visually challenged player who will matriculate  
the blind kid  from like nowheresburg  iowa  dempster  
 dymphna  
 he s not coming in til next term  he delayed  inc said they said  dural edema or something  
 though age only nine  he is in his midwest region s ranking of twelve and belows highly ranked  coach thorp tells this  
 well  i d say for a blind  soft skulled kid he s real high ranked  id  yeah  
 but dymphna  i hear thorp tell that the highness of the ranking may be due to the blindness itself  thorp and texas watson
were who scouted this player  
 i wouldn t mention the name watson near that weight room in there if i were you  
 thorp tells that his excellence of play is scouted by them to be his anticipation  as in the player dymphna arrives at the
necessary location well before the opponent player s ball  through anticipation  
 i know what anticipation is  id  
 thorp tells to me that this excellence in anticipation in the blind is because of hearing and sounds  because sounds are merely
      here  please read the comment i have carefully notated upon this folded piece of paper  
   sound merely  variations in intensity    throp   throp  
 it was meaning thorp  in excitement  he tells that one may  perforce  judge the opponent player s vaps       in more
detail by the ear than the eye  this is experimental theory of thorp  this is explaining why the highly ranked dymphna appears to
always have floated by magic to the necessary spot where a ball is soon to land  thorp tells this in a convincing manner  
 perforce  
that this blind person is able to judge the necessary spot of landing by the intensity of the sound of the ball against the
opponent player s string  
 instead of watching the contact and then imaginatively extending the beginning of its flight  like those of us hobbled by
sight  
t  idris arslanian  am compelled with thorp s telling  
 which helps explain the blindfold  
 i therefore experiment with volunteer blindness  training the ear in degrees of intensity in play  today versus whale i was
wearing the blindfold to play  
 how d it go  
 not as well as hoped  i frequently faced the wrong direction for play  i frequently judged by the intensity of balls struck on
adjacent courts and ran onto adjacent courts  intruding on play  
 we sort of wondered what all the ruckus was down there at the    s end  
 thorp tells that training the ear is a process of time  in encouragement  
 well  later  id  
 stop  wait before leaving  please conduct me to a lavatory  ted schacht  are you as yet there  
     
 are you as yet there  i very   
 whuffff watch where you re going kid for christ s sake  
 who is this please  
 troeltsch  james l   slightly doubled over  
 it is i  idris arslanian  wearing a rayon handkerchief as a blindfold over my features  i am disoriented and wishing badly for a
lavatory  wondering also what is ensuing inside the weight room  where schacht alleges you are all watching doucette weep in
clinical depression  
 kertwannnggg  just kidding  ars  it s really mike pemulis  
then you  mike pemulis  may even now be questioning why is this blindfold upon idris arslanian  
 what blindfold  ars  no  you re wearing a fucking blindfold too  
 you  mike pemulis  are also wearing a blindfold  
 just kertwanging on you  brother  
 i became disoriented on a stairway  then conversed with ted schacht  i am suspecting i do not trust your sense of laughter
enough to conduct me back upstairs  
 you should feel your way in and just for one second see the amount of high stress sweat lyle s taking off anton   the
booger   doucette in there  ars  
 doucette is the two hand player whose mole appears to be material from a nostril  clinically depressing doucette at its
appearance  
 rog on the mole  except that s not what s depressing the booger this time  this one we decided we d describe him as more
like anxiously depressed than depressed  
 one can be depressed of different types  
 boy are you young  ars  the booger s got himself convinced he s going to get the academic boot  he s been on proby this
whole year  since apparently some trouble last year with thorp s cubular trig   
 i am sympathizing with this in toto  
   and but except now he claims he s close to flunking in watson s laughable energy survey class  which would obviously
mean the old boot at term s end  if he really does flunk  he s thought himself into a brainlock of anxiety  he s in there clutching
his skull with lyle and mario  and some of the like less kind guys in there have a pool going on whether lyle can pull him back
from the brink  
 texas watson the prorector  teaching of energy in models of resource scarcity and resource plenty  

  ars  i m nodding in confirmation  fossil fuels all the way up to annular fusion fission cycles  dt lithiumization  so on and so
forth  all on a real superficial type level  since watson s basically got like a little liquid filled nubbin at the top of his spine where
his brain ought to be  
 texas watson does not overwhelm with brightness  it is true  
 but doucette s got himself convinced he s got this insurmagulate conceptual block that keeps him from grasping annulation 
even superficially  
 after we converse you will conduct me to micturate  please  
 it s the same sort of block some people get with the mean value theorem  or in optics when we get to color fields  at a
certain level of abstraction it s like the brain recoils  
 causing pain of impact within the skull  resulting in clutching the head  
 watson s gone the extra click with him  watson s good hearted if nothing else  he s tried flash cards  mnemonic rhymes 
even claymation filmstrips from over at rindge latin remedial  
 you are saying without avail  
 i m saying apparently the boogster just sits there in class  eyes bugging out  stomach in fucking knots  dope slapped by
anxiety  i m saying frozen  
 you are saying recoiling  
 the right side of his face frozen in this anxiety tic  envisioning any possible tennis career as with these little wings on it 
flying off  talking all kinds of crazy self injuring anxious depression talk  it all started with him and mario and me in the sauna 
him breaking down  me and mario trying to talk him out of the crazy washed up at fifteen type depressed talk  mario exploiting a
previous like therapeutic bond with the kid from about the mole  then with me putting dt annulation in broad stroke terms a
freaking invertebrate could have understood for christ s sake  just about passing out from the sauna all through this  finally taking
him in to lyle even with the     s still doing circuits in there  lyle s working with the booger now  between the anxiety and the
marathon sauna time it s a real feeding frenzy for old lyle let me tell you  
 i too confess experiences of anxiety for annulation with tex watson  though i am trivially thirteen and not yet required to
grapple in hard science  
 mario in the sauna kept telling doucette to just imagine somebody doing somersaults with one hand nailed to the ground 
which what the fuck is that  and lo and surprise didn t help the booger a whole lot  
 did not part the veil of maya  
 didn t do jack  
 annular energy cycles are intensively abstract  my home nation believes  
 but my whole message to boog was that dt cycles aren t all that fucking hard if you don t paralyze your brain with careerwith wings brain cartoons  the extra hot breedering and lithiumization stuff gets hairy  but the whole fusion fission wasteannulation thing in toto you can imagine as nothing but a huge right triangle  
 you are presaging to give the thumbnail lecture  
 commit this one simple model to your little pakistani ram cells  and you ll tapdance right through watson s kiddie physics
and up into optics  which is where the abstracto conceptual fur really flies  kid  let me tell you  
 i am one of the seldom of my home nation whose talents are weak in science  unhappily  
 this is why god also gave you quick hands and a wicked lob off the backhand  though  just picture a kind of massive
pseudocartographic right triangle        you ve got your central  impregnately guarded o n a n   sun strand waste intensive
fusion facility up in what used to be montpelier in what used to be vermont  in the concavity  from montpelier the process s
waste s piped to two sites  one of which is that blue glow at night up by the methuen fan complex  just south of the concavity 
right flush up against the wall and checkpoint pongo   
 which our tall and sleep depriving fans in our area point at to blow away from the south  
   roger that  where the toxo fusion s waste s plutonium fluoride s refined into plutonium     and uranium     and
fissioned in a standard if somewhat hot and risky breeder system  much of the output of which is waste u      which gets piped
or catapulted or long shiny trucked way up to what used to be loring a f b    air force base near what used to be presque isle
maine   where it s allowed to decay naturally into nep tunium     and then plutonium     and then added to the uf  fractional
waste also piped up from montpelier  then fissioned in a purposely ugly way in such a way as to create like hellacious amounts of
highly poisonous radioactive wastes  which are mixed with heavy water and specially heated zirconium piped through special
heavily guarded heated zirconium pipes back down to montpelier as raw materiel for the massive poisons needed for toxic
lithiumization and waste intenseness and annular fusion  
 my head is spinning on its axis  
 just a moving right triangular cycle of interdependence and waste creation and  utilization  see  and when are we going to
get you out on the old eschaton map for a little geopolitical sparring  ars  what with those hands and wicked lob  incidentally  the
arrhythmic meaty whacking sound is booger hitting himself in the thigh and chest in there  which self abuse is a textbook
symptom of an anxiously depressed episode  
 with this i can create sympathy  for  confusingly to me  fusion produces no waste  this we are taught in the science of my
home nation  this is the very essence of the promise of the attraction of fusion for a densely populous and waste impacted nation
such as mine  we are taught fusion to be self sufficient and wasteless perpetuation  alas  my need to visit the lavatory is becoming
distended  
 but except no  although this was the very roadblock that d stymified annulation  and what had to be overcome  and was
overcome  though in a way so unintuitive and abstracto conceptual that this is where your third world educational system s real
sadly in need of like a massive up to date textbook airlift or something  it s also at just this point in the fusion wastelessness
problem where our own glorious optical founder  inc s ex da  mrs  inc s poor cue   
 i know who you refer  
 the man himself  at just this point  makes his final lasting contribution to state science after he quit designing neutron 

 diffusion reflectors for defense  you ve seen the coprolite placque in tavis s office  this is from the a e c   for the incster s da s 
like  lasting contribution to the energy of waste  
 the purpose for which i was upon the stairs and became disoriented was to visit a lavatory  this was long ago  
 hold your water one second is all this ll take  you wouldn t even fucking be here without inc s da  you know  what the guy
did was he helped design these special holographic conversions so the team that worked on annulation could study the behavior of
subatomics in highly poisonous environments  without getting poisoned themselves  
 they thus are studying holographic conversions of the poisons instead of the poisons  
 men s sanity in corporate sterno  ars  like an optical glove box  the ultimate prophylactic  
 please conduct me  
 like but for instance did your nation know that the whole annular theory behind a type of fusion that can produce waste that s
fuel for a process whose waste is fuel for the fusion  the whole theory behind the physics of it comes out of medicine  
 this means what  a bottle of medicine  
 the study of medicine  ars  your part of the world takes annular medicine for granted now  but the whole idea of treating
cancer by giving the cancer cells themselves cancer was anathematic just a couple decades back  
 anathematic  
 as in like radical  fringe  wacko  laughed out of town on a rail by quote mainstream established science  whose idea of
treatment was to like poison the whole body and see what was left  though annular chemotherapy did start out kind of wacko 
you can see these early microphotos schacht s got that poster of that he won t take down even after you re sick of it  the early
microphotos of cancer cells getting force fed micromassive quantities of overdone beef and diet soda  forced to chain smoke
microsized marlboros near tiny little cellular phones         
 i am standing first upon one foot then upon another foot  
   except and corollarying out of the micromedical model was this equally radical idea that maybe you could achieve a highwaste annulating fusion by bombarding highly toxic radioactive particles with massive doses of stuff even more toxic than the
radioactive particles  a fusion that feeds on poisons and produces relatively stable plutonium fluoride and uranium tetra fluoride 
all you turn out to need is access to mind staggering volumes of toxic material  
 therefore placing the natural fusion site in the great concavity  
 roger and jawohl  here things get abstractly furry and i ll just skim through the fact that the only kertwang in the whole
process environmentally is that the resultant fusion turns out so greedily efficient that it sucks every last toxin and poison out of
the surrounding ecosystem  all inhibitors to organic growth for hundreds of radial clicks in every direction  
 hence the eastern concavity of anxiety and myth  
 you end up with a surrounding environment so fertilely lush it s practically unlivable  
 a rain forest on sterebolic anoids  
 close enough  
 therefore rapacial feral hamsters and insects of volkswagen size and infantile giganticism and the unmacheteable regions of
forests of the mythic eastern concavity  
 yes ars and you find you need to keep steadily dumping in toxins to keep the uninhibited ecosystem from spreading and
overrunning more ecologically stable areas  exhausting the atmosphere s poisons so that everything hyperventilates  and thus and
such  so this is why e w d  s major catapulting is from the metro area due north  
 into the eastern concavity  keeping it at bay  
 see how it all comes together  
 mr  thorp will evince keen disappointment if i resort to remove my blindfold to locate a lavatory  
 ars  i hear you  i hear fine  you don t need to go on and on  the thing to keep in mind for if you have to take watson is the
cyclic effects of the waste delivery and fusion  major catapulting is on what days  
 the dates which are in each month prime numbers  until midnight  
 which eradicates the overgrowth until the toxins are fused and utilized  the satellite scenario is that the eastern part of grid  
goes from overgrown to wasteland to overgrown several times a month  with the first week of the month being especially barren
and the last week being like nothing on earth  
 as if time itself were vastly sped up  as if nature itself had desperately to visit the lavatory  
 accelerated phenomena  which is actually equivalent to an incredible slowing down of time  the mnemonic rhyme watson
tried to get the boog to remember here is  wasteland to lush  time s in no rush  
 decelerated time  i have got you  
 and this is what the boog s saying is eating him alive the worst  conceptually  he says he s toast if he can t wrap his head
around the concept of time in flux  conceptually  it jacklights him for the whole annular model overall  granted  it s abstract  but
you should see him  one half of the face is like spasming around while the half with the mole just like hangs there staring like a
bunny you re about to run over  lyle s trying to walk him real slowly through the most basic kiddie physical principles of the
relativity of time in extreme organic environments  in between booger s trips back to the sauna  the irony for the boogerman is
you don t really even have to know that much about the temporal flux stuff  since watson s forehead gets all mottled and prunylooking when he thinks about it himself  
 do not please necessitate begging from me  idris arslanian   the eastern concavity of course being a whole different kettle
of colored horses from what inc calls the barren eliotical wastes of the western concavity  let me tell you  
 i will let you tell me anything as long as it is told to me over the porcelain of a lavatory  
 interesting step you re doing there  id  i have to say    i beg without frequency  my home culture views begging as low caste

en route  r  lenz s mouth writhes and he scratches at the little rhy nophemic rash and sniffs terribly and complains of terrible
late autumn leaf mold allergies  forgetting that bruce green knows all too well what coke hydrolysis s symptoms are from having
done so many lines himself  back when life with m  bonk was one big party 
lenz details how the vegetarian new joel girl s veil is because of this condition people get where she s got only one eye that s
right in the middle of her forehead  from birth  like a seahorse  and asks green not even to think of asking how he knows this fact 
while green acts as lookout while lenz relieves himself against a market st  dumpster  lenz swears green to secrecy about
how poor old scarred up diseased charlotte treat had sworn him to secrecy about her secret dream in sobriety was to someday get
her g e d  and become a dental hygienist specializing in educating youngsters pathologically frightened of dental anesthesia 
because her dream was to help youngsters  and but how she feared her virus has placed her secret dream forever out of
reach       
all the way up the spur s harvard st  toward union square  in a barely nw vector  lenz consumes several minutes and less
than twenty breaths sharing with green some painful family of origin issues about how lenz s mother mrs  lenz  a thricedivorcee and data processor  was so unspeakably obese she had to make her own mumus out of brocade drapes and cotton
tablecloths and never once did come to parents  day at bishop anthony mcdiardama elementary school in fall river ma
because of the parents had to sit in the youngsters  little liftable desktop desks during the parents  day presentations and skits  and
the one time mrs  l  hove her way down to b a m e s  for parents  day and tried to seat herself at little randall l  s desk between
mrs  lamb and mrs  leroux she broke the desk into kindling and needed four stocky cranberry farmer dads and a textbook dolly
to arise back up from the classroom floor  and never went back  fabricating thin excuses of busyness with data processing and
basic disinterest in randy l  s schoolwork  lenz shares how then in adolescence  his   his mother died because one day she was
riding a greyhound bus from fall river ma north to quincy ma to visit her son in a commonwealth youth corrections facility
lenz was doing research for a possible screenplay in  and during the voyage on the bus she had to go potty  and she was in the
bus s tiny potty in the rear of the bus going about her private business of going potty  as she later testified  and even though it was
the height of winter she had the little window of the potty wide open  for reasons lenz predicts green doesn t want to hear about 
on the northbound bus  and how this was one of the last years of unsubsidized ordinational year dating  and the final fiscal year
that actual maintenance work had ever been done on the infernous six lane commuter ravaged commonwealth route    from fall
river to boston s south shore by the pre o n a n ite governor claprood s commonwealth highway authority  and the
greyhound bus encountered a poorly marked under construction area where    was all stripped down to the dimplediron sheeting below and was tooth rattlingly striated and chuckholed and torn up and just in general basically a mess  and the
poorly marked and unflag manned debris plus the excessive speed of the northbound bus made it jounce godawfully  the bus  and
swerve violently to and forth  fighting to maintain control of what there was of the road  and passengers were hurled violently
from their seats while  meanwhile  back in the closet sized rear potty  mrs  lenz  right in the process of going potty  was hurled
from the toilet by the first swerve and proceeded to do some high velocity and human waste flinging pinballing back and forth
against the potty s plastic walls  and when the bus finally regained total control and resumed course mrs  lenz had  freakishly
enough  ended up her human pinballing with her bare and unspeakably huge backside wedged tight in the open window of the
potty  so forcefully ensconced into the recesstacle that she was unable to extricate  and the bus continued on its northward sojourn
the rest of the way up    with mrs  lenz s bare backside protruding from the ensconcing window  prompting car horns and
derisive oratory from other vehicles  and mrs  lenz s plaintiff shouts for help were unavailed by the passengers that were arising
back up off the floor and rubbing their sore noggins and hearing mrs  lenz s mortified screams from behind the potty s locked
reinforced plastic door  but were unable to excretate her because the potty s door locked from the interior by sliding across a
deadbolt that made the door s outside say occupied occupado occupe  and the door was locked  and mrs  lenz was wedged
beyond the reach of arm length and couldn t reach the deadbolt no matter how plaintiffly she reached out her mammoth fatwattled arm  and  like fully     of all clinically obese americans  mrs  lenz was diagnosed clinically claustrophobic and took
prescription medication for anxiety and ensconcement phobias  and she ended up successfully filing a seven figure suit against
greyhound lines and the almost defunct commonwealth highway authority for psychiatric trauma  public mortification  and
second degree frostbite  and received such a morbidly obese settlement from the dukakis appointed   th circus civil court that
when the check arrived  in an extra long size envelope to accommodate all the zeroes  mrs  l  lost all will to data process or cook
or clean  or nurture  or finally even move  simply reclining in a custom designed     meter wide re cliner watching interlace
gothic romances and consuming mammoth volumes of high lipid pastry brought on gold trays by a pastry chef she d had put at
her individual    hour disposal and outfitted with a cellular beeper  until four months after the huge settlement she ruptured and
died  her mouth so crammed with peach cobbler the paramedics were hapless to administer c p r   which lenz says he knows  by
the way   c p r 

 by the time they hit the spur  their northwest tacking has wheeled broadly right to become more truly north  their route down
here is a mon drian of alleys narrowed to near defiles from all the dumpsters  lenz goes first  blaze trailing  lenz gives these sort
of smoky looks to every female that passes within eyeshot  their vector is now mostly n nw  they stroll through the rich smell
of dryer exhaust from the backside of a laundromat off dustin and comm  the city of metro boston ma at night  the ding and
trundle of the b and c greenie trains heading up comm  ave  s hill  west  street drunks sitting with their backs to sooted walls 
seeming to study their laps  even the mist of their breath discolored  the complex hiss of bus brakes  the jagged shadows
distending with headlights  passage  latin music drifting through the spur s projects  twined around some      shine stuff from a
boombox over off feeny park  and in between these a haunting plasm of hawaiian type music that sounds at once top volume and
far far away  the zithery drifting polynesian strains make bruce green s face spread in a flat mask of psychic pain he doesn t even
feel is there  and then the music s gone  lenz asks green what it s like to work with ice all day at leisure time ice and then
himself theorizes on what it must be like  he ll bet  with your crushed ice and ice cubes in pale blue plastic bags with a staple for a
twistie and dry ice in wood tubs pouring out white smoke and then your huge blocks of industrial ice packed in fragrant sawdust 
the huge blocks of man sized ice with flaws way inside like trapped white faces  white flames of internal cracks  your picks and
hatchets and really big tongs  red knuckles and rimed windows and thin bitter freezer smell with runny nosed poles in plaid coats
and kalpacs  your older ones with a chronic cant to one side from all the time lugging ice 
they crunch through iridescent chunks of what lenz i d s as a busted windshield  lenz shares feelings on how between three
ex husbands and feral attorneys and a pastry chef that used pastry dependence to warp and twist her into distorting a testament
toward the chef and lenz s being through red tape still in quincy s y c a  hold and in a weak litigational vantage  the ruptured
mrs  l  s will had left him out in the cold to self fend by his urban wits while ex husbands and patissiers lay on riviera beachfurniture fanning themselves with high denomination currency  about all which lenz says he grapples with the issues of on a like
daily basis  leaving green a gap to make understanding sounds  green s jacket creaks as he breathes  the windshield glass is in an
alley whose fire escapes are hung with what look like wet frozen tarps  the alley s tight packed dumpsters and knobless steel
doors and the dull black of total grime  the blunt snout of a bus protrudes into the frame of the alley s end  idling 
dumpsters  garbage doesn t have just one smell  depending  the urban lume makes the urban night only semidark  as in
licoricey  a luminescence just under the skin of the dark  and swelling  green keeps them updated re time  lenz has begun to refer
to green as  brother   lenz says he has to piss like a racehorse  he says the nice thing about the urban city is that it s one big
commode  the way lenz pronounces brother involves one r  green moves up to stand in the mouth of the alley  facing out  giving
lenz a little privacy several dumpsters behind  green stands there in the start of the alley s shadow  in the bus s warm backwash 
his elbows out and hands in the jacket s little pockets  looking out  it s unclear whether green knows lenz is under the influence
of bing  all he feels is a moment of deep wrenching loss  of wishing getting high was still pleasurable for him so he could get
high  this feeling comes and goes all day every day  still  green takes a gasper from behind his ear and lights it and puts a fresh
one on deck behind the ear  union square  allston  kiss me where it smells  she said  so i took her to allston  unquote  union
square s lights throb  whenever somebody stops blowing their horn somebody else starts blowing their horn  there s three
chinese women waiting at the light across the street from the guy with the lobsters  each of them s got a shopping bag  an old
vw bug like doony glynn s vw bug idling mufflerless outside riley s roast beef  except doony s bug s engine is exposed
where the back hood got removed to expose the bug s guts  it s like impossible to ever spot a chinese woman on a boston street
that s under sixty or over     m  or not carrying a shopping bag  except never more than one bag  if you close your eyes on a busy
urban sidewalk the sound of everybody s different footwear s footsteps all put together sounds like something getting chewed by
something huge and tireless and patient  the searing facts of the case of bruce green s natural parents  deaths when he was a
toddler are so deeply repressed inside green that whole strata and substrata of silence and mute dumb animal suffering will have
to be strip mined up and dealt with a day at a time in sobriety for green even to remember how  on his fifth xmas eve  in
waltham ma  his pop had taken the hydrant sized little brucie green aside and given him  to give his beloved mama for xmas  a
gaily gauguin colored can of polynesian mauna loa brand       macadamia nuts  said cylindrical can of nuts then toted
upstairs by the child and painstakingly wrapped in so much foil sheen paper that the final wrapped present looked like an
oversized dachshund that had required first bludgeoning and then restraint at both ends with two rolls each of scotch tape and
garish fuchsia ribbon to be subdued and wrapped and placed under the gaily lit pine  and even then the package seemed mushily to
struggle as the substrata of paper shifted and settled 
bruce green s pop mr  green had at one time been one of new england s most influential aerobics instructors   even
costarring once or twice  in the decade before digital dissemination  on the widely rented buns of steel aerobics home video series
  and had been in high demand and very influential until  to his horror  in his late twenties  the absolute prime of an aerobics
instructor s working life  either one of mr  green s legs began spontaneously to grow or the other leg began spontaneously to
retract  because within weeks one leg was all of a sudden nearly six inches longer than the other   bruce green s one unrepressed
visual memory of the man is of a man who progressively and perilously leaned as he hobbled from specialist to specialist   and
he had to get outfitted with a specialized orthopedic boot  black as a cauldron  that seemed to be     sole and resembled an
asphalt spreader s clunky boot  and weighed several pounds  and looked absurd with spandex leggings  and the long and short of
it was that brucie green s pop was aerobically washed up by the leg and boot  and had to career change  and went bitterly to work
for a waltham novelty or notions concern  something with  n in the name  acme novelties  n notions or some such  where mr 
green designed sort of sadistic practical joke supplies  specializing in the jolly jolt hand buzzer and blammo cigar productlines  with a sideline in entomological icecubes and artificial dandruff  etc  demoralizing  sedentary  character twisting work  is
what an older child would have been able to understand  peering from his nightlit doorway at an unshaven man who clunkily
paced away the wee hours on a nightly basis down in the living room  his gait like a bosun s in heavy seas  occasionally breaking
into a tiny tentative gluteal thruster squat and kick  almost falling  muttering bitterly  carrying a falstaff tallboy 
something touching about a gift that a toddler s so awfully overwrapped makes a sickly pale and neurasthenic but doting mrs 
green  bruce s beloved mama  choose the mugged dachshund foil sheen cylinder present first  of course  to open  on xmas
morning  as they sit before the crackling fireplace in different chairs by different windows with views of waltham sleet  with
bowls of xmas snacks and acme  n logoed mugs of cocoa and hazelnut decaf and watch each other taking turns opening gifts 

 brucie s little face aglow in the firelight as the unwrapping of the nuts proceeds through layer and stratum  mrs  green a couple
times having to use her teeth on the rinds of tape  finally the last layer is off and the gay colored can in view  mauna loa  mrs 
green s favorite and most decadent special treat food  world s highest calorie food except for like pure suet  nuts so yummy they
should be spelled s i n  she says  brucie excitedly bobbing in his chair  spilling cocoa and gummi bears  a loving toddler  more
excited about his gift s receipt than what he s going to get himself  his mother s clasped hands before her sunken bosom  sighs of
delight and protest  and an ez open lid  on the can 
which the contents of the macadamia labelled can is really a coiled cloth snake with an ejaculatory spring  the snake sprongs
out as mrs  g  screams  a hand to her throat  mr  green howls with bitterly professional practical gag mirth and clunks over and
slaps little bruce on the back so hard that brucie expels a lime gummi bear he d been eating   this too a visual memory 
contextless and creepy   which arcs across the living room and lands in the fireplace s fire with a little green siss of flame  the
cloth snake s arc has terminated at the imitation crystal chandelier overhead  where the snake gets caught and hangs with
quivering spring as the chandelier swings and tinkles and mr  green s thigh slapping laughter takes a while to run down even as
brucie s mama s hand at her delicate throat becomes claw shaped and she claws at her throat and gurgles and slumps over to
starboard with a fatal cardiac  her cyanotic mouth still open in surprise  for the first couple minutes mr  green thinks she s putting
them on  and he keeps rating her performance on an acme interdepartmental     gag scale until he finally gets pissed off and
starts saying she s drawing the gag out too long  that she s going to scare their little brucie who s sitting there under the swinging
crystal  wide eyed and silent 
and bruce green uttered not another out loud word until his last year of grade school  living by then in winchester with his
late mother s sister  a decent but dustbowly looking seventh day adventist who never once pressed brucie to speak  probably out
of sympathy  probably sympathizing with the searing pain the opaque eyed child must have felt over not only giving his mama a
lethal xmas present but over then having to watch his widowed asymetrical pop cave psycho spiritually in after the wake  watching mr  green pace and clunk around the living room all night every night after work and an undermicrowaved supper for two  in
his frankensteinian boot  clunking around in circles  scratching slowly at his face and arms until he looked less scourged than
brambled  and in loosely associated mutters cursing god and himself and acme nuts  n serpents or whatever  and leaving the
fatal snake up hanging from the fake crystal fixture and the fatal xmas tree up in its little red metal stand until all the strings of
lights went out and the strings of popcorn got dark and hard and the stand s bowl of water evaporated so the tree s needles died and
fell brownly off onto the rest of the still unopened xmas presents clustered below  one of which was a package of nebraska cornfed steaks whose cherub motif wrapping was beginning ominously to swell     and then finally the even more searing childhood
pain of the public arrest and media scandal and sanity hearing and midwest trial as it was established after the fact that the postxmas mr  green   whose one encouraging sign of holding some tattered remnants of himself together after the funeral had been
the fact that he still went faithfully every day to work at acme inc    had gone in and packed a totally random case of the
company s outgoing blammo cigars with vengefully lethal tetryl based high explosives  and a v f w   three rotarians  and   
shriners had been grotesquely decapitated across southeastern ohio before the federal a t f  traced the grisly forensic fragments
back to b  green sr  s blammo lab  in waltham  and then the extradition and horribly complex sanity hearing and trial and
controversial sentencing  and then the appeals and deathwatch and lethal injection  bruce green s aunt handing out poorly
reproduced w  miller tracts to the crowds outside the ohio prison as the clock ticked down to injection  little bruce in tow  blankfaced and watching  the crowd of media and anti capital activists and defarge like picnickers milling and roiling  many t shirts
for sale  and the red faced men in sportcoats and fezzes  oh their rage twisted faces the same red as their fezzes as the men
careened this way and that in their little cars  formations of motorized shriners buzzing the gates of the o d c  maximum facility
and shouting burn baby burn or the more timely get lethally injected baby get lethally injected  bruce green s aunt with her
center parted hair visibly graying under the pillbox hat and face obscured for three ohio months behind the black mesh veil that
fluttered from the pillbox hat  clutching little bruce s head to her underwired bosom day after day until his blank face was
smooshed in on one side     green s guilt  pain  fear and self loathing have over years of unprescribed medication been compressed
to the igneous point where he now knows only that he compulsively avoids any product or service with  n in its name  always
checks a palm before a handshake  will go blocks out of his way to avoid any parade involving fezzes in little cars  and has this
silent  substratified fascination horror ge stalt about all things even remotely polynesian  it s probably the distant and attenuated
luau music echoing erratically back and forth through angled blocks of allston cement that causes bruce green to wander as if
mesmerized out of union square and all the way up comm  ave  into brighton and up to like the corner of comm  ave  and
brainerd road  the home of the unexamined life nightclub with its tilted flickering bottle of blue neon over the entrance  before
he realizes that lenz is no longer beside him asking the time  that lenz hadn t followed him up the hill even though green had
stood there outside the union square alley way longer than anybody could have needed to take a legitimate whiz 
he and lenz have become separated  he realizes  now way southwest of union on comm   green looks around at traffic and
t tracks and bar patrons and t u l  s huge bottle s low neon flutter  he wonders whether he s somehow blown lenz off or
whether lenz s blown him off  and that s all he wonders  that s the total complexity the speculation assumes  that s his thought for
the minute  it s like the whole nut can and cigar traumas drained into some psychic sump at puberty  sank and left only an oily
slick that catches the light in distorted ways  the warbly polynesian music s way clearer up here  he starts up the steep hill on
brainerd rd   which terminates at the enfield line  maybe lenz can t move straightforwardly south at all past a certain time  the
acclivity is not kind to asphalt spreader s boots  after the initial crazed gerbil in brain phase of early withdrawal and detox  bruce
green has now returned to his normal psychorepressed cerebral state where he has about one fully developed thought every sixty
seconds  and then just one at a time  a thought  each materializing already fully developed and sitting there and then melting back
away like a languid liquid crystal display  his ennet house counselor  the extremely tough loving calvin t   complains that
listening to green is like listening to a faucet with a very slow drip  his rap is that green seems not serene or detached but totally
shut down  disassociated  and calvin t  tries weekly to draw green out by pissing him off  green s next full thought is the
realization that even though the hideous hawaiian music had sounded like it was drifting up northward from down at the allston
spur  it s somewhat louder now the farther west he moves toward enfield s cambridge st  dogleg and st  elizabeth s hospital 
brainerd between commonwealth and cambridge st  is a sine wave of lung busting hills through neighborhoods tiny ewell had

 described as depressed residential  unending rows of crammed together triple decker houses with those tiny sad architectural
differences that seem to highlight the essential sameness  with sagging porches and psoriatic paint jobs or aluminum siding gone
carbuncular from violent temperature swings  yard litter and dishes and patchy grass and fenced pets and children s toys lying
around in discarded attitudes and eclectic food smells and wildly different patterned curtains or blinds in a house s different
windows due to these old houses are carved up inside into apartments for like alienated b u  students or canadian and concavitydisplaced families or even more alienated b c  students  or probably it looks like the bulk of the lease holders are green andbonkesque younger blue collar hard partying types that have posters of the fiends in human shape or choosy mothers or snout
or the bioavailable five       in the bathroom and black lights in the bedroom and oil change stains in the driveway and that
throw their supper dishes into the yard and buy new dishes at caldor instead of washing their dishes and that still  in their
twenties  ingest substances nightly and use party as a verb and put their sound systems  speakers in their apartments  windows
facing out and crank the volume out of sheer high spirit obnoxiousness because they still have their girlfriends to pound beers
with and do shotguns of dope into the mouth of and do lines of bing off various parts of the naked body of  and still find pounding
beers and doing bongs and lines fun and get to have fun on a nightly after work basis  cranking the tunes out into the
neighborhood air  the street s bare trees are densely limbed  they re a certain type of tree  they look like inverted brooms in the
residential dark  green doesn t know his tree names  the hawaiian music is what s pulled him southwest  it emerges  it s
originating from someplace in this very neighborhood somewhere around w  brainerd  and green moves upriver toward what
sounds like the source of the sound with a blankly horrified fascination  most of the yards are fenced in stainless steel chain link
fencing  and occasional yard dogs whine or more commonly bark and snarl and leap territorially at green from behind their
fences  the fences shivering from the impact and the chain link stuff dented outward from previous impacts from previous
passersby  the thought that he isn t scared of dogs develops and recedes in green s midbrain  his jacket creaks with every step 
the temperature is steadily dropping  the fenced front yards are the toy and beer can strewn type where the brown grass grows in
uneven tufts and the leaves haven t been raked and are piled in wind blown lines of force along the base of the fence and unpruned
hedges and overfull wastebaskets and untwisted trash bags are on the sagging porch because nobody s gotten around to taking
them down to the e w d  dumpster at the corner and garbage from the overfull receptacles blows out into the yard and mixes with
the leaves along the fences  base and some gets out into the street and is never picked up and eventually becomes part of the
composition of the street  a nonpeanut m m box is like intaglioed into the concrete of the sidewalk under green  so bleached by
the elements it s turned bone white and is only barely identifiable as a nonpeanut m m box  for instance  and  looking up from
identifying the m m box s make  green now espies randy lenz  green has happened upon lenz  way up here on brainerd  now
strolling briskly alone up ahead of green  not close but visible under a functioning streetlight about a block farther uphill on
brainerd  there s some disincentive to call out  the incline on this block isn t bad  it s cold enough now so his breath looks the
same whether he s smoking or not  the tall curved streetlamps here look to green just like the weaponish part of the martian
vessels that fired fatal rays in their conquest of the planet in an ancient cartridge tommy doocy d never tired of that he labelled
the case  war of the welles   the hawaiian music dominates the aural landscape by this point  now  coming from someplace up
near where he sees the back of lenz s coat  someone has put polynesian music speakers in their window  pretty clearly  creepy
slack key steel guitar balloons across the dim street  booms off the sagging facades opposite  it s don ho and the sol hoopi
players  the grass skirt and foamy breakers sound that makes green put his fingers in his ears while at the same time he moves
more urgently toward the hawaiian music source  a pink or aqua three decker with a second floor dormer and red shingled roof
with a blue and white quenucker flag on a pole protruding from a window in the dormer and serious jbl speakers facing outward
in the two windows on either side of the flag  with the screens off so you can see the woofers throbbing like brown bellies hulaing  bathing the      block of w  brainerd in dreadful ukuleles and hollow log percussives  all the blunt fingers in his ears do is
add the squeak of green s pulse and the underwater sound of his respiration to the music  though  figures in plaid flannel or else
floral hawaiian shirts and those flower necklaces melt in and out of lit view behind and over the window speakers with the oozing
quality of large group chemical fun and dancing and social intercoursing  the lit windows make slender rectangles of light out
across the yard  which the yard is a sty  something about randy lenz s movements up ahead  the high kneed tiptoed skulk of a
vaudeville fiend up to no good at all  keeps green from calling out to him even if he could have made himself heard over what to
him is a roar of blood and breath and ho  lenz moves through the one operative streetlight s cone across the sidewalk and over to
the stainless chain link of the same que nucker house  holding something out to a shetland sized dog whose leash is attached to a
fluorescent plastic clothesliney thing by a pulley  and can slide  it s cold and the air is thin and keen and his fingers are icy in his
ears  which ache with cold  green watches  rapt on levels he doesn t know he has  drawn slowly forward  moving his head from
side to side to keep from losing lenz in the fog of his breath  not calling out  but transfixed  green and mildred bonk and the
other couple they d shared a trailer with t  doocy with had gone through a phase one time where they d crash various collegiate
parties and mix with the upper scale collegiates  and once in one february green found himself at a harvard u  dorm where they
were having a like beach theme party  with a dumptruck s worth of sand on the common room floor and everybody with flower
necklaces and skin bronzed with cream or uv booth salon visits  all the towheaded guys in floral untucked shirts walking around
with lockjawed noblest oblige and drinking drinks with umbrellas in them or else wearing speedos with no shirts and not one
fucking pimple anyplace on their back and pretending to surf on a surfboard somebody had nailed to a hump shaped wave made
of blue and white papier mache with a motor inside that made the fake wave sort of undulate  and all the girls in grass skirts
oozing around the room trying to hula in a shimmying way that showed their thighs  lipovac scars through the shimmying grass
of their skirts  and mildred bonk had donned a grass skirt and bikini top out of the pile by the keggers and even though almost
seven months pregnant had oozed and shimmied right into the mainstream of the swing of things  but bruce green had felt
awkward and out of place in his cheap leather jacket and haircut he d dyed orange with gasoline in a blackout and the eat the
rich patch he d perversely let mildred bonk sew onto the groin of his police pants  and then they d finally got tired of the
 hawaii five    theme and started in with the don ho and sol hoopi cds  and green had gotten so uncomfortably fascinated and
repelled and paralyzed by the polynesian tunes that he d set up a cabana chair right by the kegs and had sat there overworking the
pump on the kegs and downing one plastic cup after another of beer foam until he got so blind drunk his sphincter had failed and
he d not only pissed but also actually shit his pants  for only the second time ever  and the first public time ever  and was mortified

 with complexly layered shame  and had to ease very gingerly into the nearest by head and remove his pants and wipe himself off
like a fucking baby  having to shut one eye to make sure which him he saw was him  and then there d been nothing to do with the
fouled police pants but crack the bathroom door and reach a tattooed arm out with the pants and bury them in the living room s
sand like a housecat s litterbox  and then of course what was he supposed to put on if he ever wanted to leave that head or dorm
again  to get home  so he d had to hold one eye shut and reach one arm out again and like strain to reach the pile of grass skirts and
bikini tops and snatch a grass skirt  and put it on  and slip out of the hawaiian dorm out a side door without letting anybody see
him  and then ride the red line and c greenie and then a bus all the way home in february in a cheap leather jacket and asphaltspreader s boots and a grass skirt  the grass of which rode up in the most horrifying way  and he d spent the next three days not
leaving the trailer in the spur  in a paralyzing depression of unknown etiology  lying on tommy d  s crusty stained sofa and
drinking southern comfort straight out of the bottle and watching doocy s snakes not move once in three days  in their tank  and
mildred had given him two days of high volume shit for first sulking antisocially by the keg and then screwing out and
abandoning her at seven months gone to a sandy room full of tanly anomic blondes who said catty things about her tattoos and
creepy boys who talked without moving their lower jaw and asked her things like where she  summered  and kept offering her
advice on no load funds and inviting her upstairs to check out their durer prints and saying they found overweight girls terribly
compelling in their defiance of culturo ascetic norms  and bruce green lay there with a head full of hoopi and unresolved pain
and didn t say a word or even have a fully developed thought for three days  and had hidden the grass skirt under the dustruffle of
the couch and later savagely torn it to shreds and sprinkled the clippings over doocy s hydroponic marijuana development in the
tub  for mulch  lenz goes in and out of green s focus several times within a dozen andante strides  still out in front of the
canadian refugee type house that s drawn green on  lenz holding a little can of something up over one side of the fence s gate
and dribbling something onto the gate  holding something else that suddenly engages the dog s full attention  for some reason
green thinks to check his watch  the pink or orange clothesline quivers as the leash s pulley runs along it as the dog comes up to
meet lenz inside the gate he s slowly opened  the huge dog seems neither friendly nor unfriendly toward lenz  but his attention is
engaged  the leash and pulley could never hold him if he decided lenz was food  there s bitter smelling material from his ear on
green s finger  which he can t help but sniff  he s forgotten and left the other finger in his ear  he s now pretty close  standing in a
van s shadow just outside the pyramid of sodium light from the streetlight  like two houses down from the source of the grisly
sound  which all of a sudden is in the silence between cuts of ho s early don ho  from hawaii with all my love  so that green
can hear baritone canadianese party voices through the open windows and also the low lalations of baby talk of some sort from
lenz   pooty ooty doggy woggy  and whatnot  presumably directed at the dog  who s coming over to lenz in a sort of neutrally
cautious but attentive way  green has no clue what kind of dog it is  but it s big  green can remember not the sight but the two
very different sounds of the footfalls of his pop the late mr  green pacing the waltham living room  the crinkle of the paper bag
around the tallboy in his hand  it s well after     h  the dog s leash slides hissing to the end of the day glo line and stops the dog
a couple paces from the inside of the gate  where lenz is standing  inclined in the slight forward way of somebody who s talking
baby talk to a dog  green can see that lenz has a slightly gnawed square of don g  s hard old meatloaf out in front of him 
holding it toward the straining dog  lenz has the blankly intent look of a short haired man with a geiger counter  the hideously
compelling ho starts again with the total abruptness that makes cds so creepy  green s got one finger in one ear  shifting around
slightly to keep lenz s lampshadow from blocking the view  the music balloons and booms  the nucks have turned it way up for
 my lovely launa una luau lady   a song that s always made green want to put his head through a window  part of the instrumentals sounds like a harp on acid  the hollow log percussives are like a heart in your extremest type terror  green fancies he
can see windows in the houses opposite vibrate from the horrific vibration  green s having way more than one thought p m  now 
the squeak of the gerbil wheel starting to crank deep inside  the undulating shiver is a slack steel guitar that fills little brucie s
head with white sand and undulating tummies and heads that resemble new year s subsidized parade balloons  huge soft shiny
baggy wrinkled grinning heads nodding and bobbing as they slowly inflate to the shape of a giant head  tilted forward  straining at
the ropes they re pulled by  green hasn t watched a new year s parade since the year of the tucks medicated pad s  which had
been obscene  green s close enough to see that the hawaiianized nuck house is     w  brainerd  blue collar type cars and  x s
and vans are all up and down the street packed in in a somehow partyish attitude  as in parked in a hurry  some of them with
canadian lettering on the plates  fleur de lis stickers and slogans in canadian on some of the windows also  an old montego
cammed out into a slingshot dragster is parked square in front of     in a sort of menacing way with two wheels up on the curb
and a circle of flowers hung jauntily over the antenna  and the ellipses of dull fade in the paintjob of the hood that show the
engine s been bored out and the hood gets real hot  and lenz has gotten down on one knee and breaks off some of the meatloaf
and tosses it underhand to the ground inside the leash s range  the dog goes over and lowers its head to the meat  the distinctive
sound of gately s meatloaf getting chewed plus the ghastly music s zithery warbling roar  lenz now rises and his movements in
the yard have a melting and wraithlike quality in the different shades of shadow  the lit window farthest from the limp flag has
solid swarthy guys in beards and loud shirts passing back and forth snapping their fingers under their elbows with flower strewn
females in tow  many of the heads are thrown back and attached to molson bottles  green s jacket creaks as he tries to breathe 
the snake had leapt from the can with a sound like  spronnnnng  his aunt at the winchester breakfast nook  in dazzling winter
dawnlight  quietly doing a word search puzzle  two dormer windows are half blocked by the throbbing rectangles of the jbls 
green s the type that can recognize a jbl speaker and molson green bottle from way far away 
a developed thought coheres  ho s voice has the quality of a type of  ointment 
any displaced and shaggy nuck head in these windows chancing to look out into the yard now would be able to probably see
lenz depositing another chunk of meat in front of the pet and removing something from up near his shoulder under his topcoat as
he s melting stealthily all the way around behind the dog to sort of straddle the big dog from the rear  easing the last of the loaf
down in front of the dog  the big dog hunched  the crunch of don s cornflake topping and the goopy sound of a dog eating institutional meat  the arm comes out from under the coat and goes up with something that looks like it would glitter if the windows 
yardlight reached far enough  bruce green keeps trying to wave his breath out of the way  lenz s fine coat billows around the
dog s flanks as lenz braces and leans and gathers the hunched thing s scruff in one hand and straightens up with a mighty grunting
hoist that brings the animal up onto its hind legs as its front legs dig frantically at empty air  and the dog s whine brings a lei and 

 flannel shape to the lit space above one speaker overhead  green doesn t even think of calling out from his shadowed spot  and the
moment hangs there with the dog upright and lenz behind it  bringing the upraised hand down in front and hard across the dog s
throat  there s a lightless arc from the spot lenz s hand crossed  the arc splatters the gate and the sidewalk outside it  the music
balloons without cease but green hears lenz say what sounds like  how dare you  with great emphasis as he drops the dog
forward onto the yard as there s a high pitched male sound from the form at the window and the dog goes down and hits the
ground on its side with the meaty crunch of a    kilo bag of party size cubelets  all four legs dog paddling uselessly  the dark
surface of the lawn blackening in a pulsing curve before its jaws that open and close  green has moved unthinking out of the
vanshadow toward lenz and now thinks and stops between two trees by the street in front of     wanting to call to lenz and
feeling the strangled aphasia people feel in bad dreams  and so just stands there between the treetrunks with a finger in one ear 
looking  the way lenz stands over the hull of the big dog is like you stand over a punished child  at full height and radiating
authority  and the moment hangs there distended like that until there s the shriek of long shut windows opening against the ho and
the dire sound of numerous high tempo logger s boots rushing down stairs inside      the creepily friendly bachelor that lived
next to his aunt had had two big groomed dogs and when bruce passed the house the dogs  toenails would scrabble on the wood of
the front porch and run with their tails up to the anodized fence as bruce came by and jump up and like sort of play the metal
fence with their paws  excited to see him  to just like set eyes on him  lenz s arm with the knife is up again and ungleaming in the
streetlight s light as lenz uses his other hand on the top of the fence to vault the fence sideways and tear ass uphill up brainerd
rd  in the southwest direction of enfield  his loafers making a quality sound on the pavement and his open coat filling like a sail 
green retreats to behind one of the trees as beefy flannel forms with leis shedding petals  their speech grunty foreign and
unmistakably canadian  a couple with ukuleles  spill out like ants over the sagging porch and into the yard  mill and jabber  a
couple kneel by the form of the former dog  a bearded guy so huge a hawaiian shirt looks tight on him has picked up the meatloaf s baggie  another guy without very much hair picks what looks like a white caterpillar out of the dark grass and holds it up
delicately between his thumb and finger  looking at it  yet another huge guy in suspenders drops his beer and picks up the limp
dog and it lies across his arms on its back with its head way back like a swooned girl  dripping and with one leg still going  and
the guy is either screaming or singing  the original massive nuck with the baggie clutches his head to signal agitation as he and
two other nucks run heavily to the slingshot montego  a first floor light in the house across brainerd lights up and backlights a
figure in a sort of suit and metal wheelchair sitting right up next to the window in the sideways way of wheelchairs that want to
get right up next to something  scanning the street and nuck swarmed yard  the hawaiian music has apparently stopped  but not
abruptly  it s not like somebody took it off in the middle  green has retreated to behind a tree  which he sort of one arm hugs  a
thick girl in a horrible grass skirt is saying  dyu   several times  there are obscenities and heavily accented stock phrases like
 stop   and  there he goes    with pointing  several guys are running up the sidewalk after lenz  but they re in boots  and lenz is
way ahead and now disappears as he cuts like a tailback left and disappears down either an alley or a serious driveway  though
you can still hear his fine shoes  one of the guys actually shakes his fist as he gives chase  the montego with the twin cam reveals
muffler problems and clunks down off the curb and lays two parentheses as it    s professionally around in the middle of the
street and peels out up in lenz s direction  a very low and fast and no shit car  its antenna s gay lei tugged by speed into a strained
ellipse and leaving a wake of white petals that take forever to stop falling  green thinks his finger might be frozen to his ear s
inside  nobody seems to be gesticulating about anything about maybe an accomplice  there s no evidence they re looking around
for any other unwittingly guilty accessory type party  another wheelchaired form has appeared just behind and to the right of the
first seated backlit form across the street  and they re both in a position to see green up against the tree with his hand to his ear so
it looks like he s maybe receiving communiques from some kind of earpiece  the nucks are still milling around the yard in a way
that s indescribably foreign as the one nuck staggers in circles under the weight of the expired dog  saying something to the sky 
green is getting to know this one tree very well  spread out against its lee side and breathing into the bark of the tree so his
exhaled breath won t plume out from behind the tree and be seen as an accomplice s breath  potentially 
mario incandenza s nineteenth birthday will be wednesday    november  the day before thanksgiving  his insomnia
worsens as madame psychosis s hiatus enters its third week and wyyy tries bringing back poor miss diagnosis again  who s
started in on a pig latin reading of the revelation of john that makes you so embarrassed for her it s uncomfortable  for a couple
nights in the hmh living room he tries falling asleep to wods  an am fringe outfit that plays narcotizing orchestral
arrangements of old carpenters songs  it makes things worse  it s weird to feel like you miss someone you re not even sure you
know 
he gets a serious burn on his pelvis leaning against a hot steel stove talking to mrs  clarke  his hip is swaddled in bandages
under orin s old corduroys  and there s a sucking sound of salve when he walks  late at night  unable to sleep  the birth related
disability that wasn t even definitively diagnosed until mario was six and had let orin tattoo his shoulder with the red coil of an
immersion heater is called familial dysautonomia  a neurological deficit whereby he can t feel physical pain very well  a lot of
the e t a s kid him about they should have such problems  and even hal s sometimes felt a twinge of envy about it  but the defect
is a serious hassle and actually very dangerous  see for instance the burnt pelvis  which wasn t even discovered until mrs  clarke
thought she smelled her eggplant overcooking 
at hmh he lies on the air mattress in a tight down bag on the edge of the violet plant light with the wind rattling the big east
window  listening to buttery violins and what sounds like a zither  there s sometimes a scream upstairs  shrill and drawn out  from
where c t  s and the moms s rooms are  mario listens closely for whether the sound ends up as avril laughing or avril screaming 
she gets night terrors  which are like nightmares but worse  and which afflict small children and apparently also adults who eat the
day s biggest meal right before bed 
his nighttime prayers take almost an hour and sometimes more and are not a chore  he doesn t kneel  it s more like a
conversation  and he s not crazy  it s not like he hears anybody or anything conversing back with him  hal s established 
hal had asked him when he ll start coming back to their room to sleep  which made mario feel good 
he keeps trying to imagine madame psychosis   whom he imagines as being very tall   lying in an xl beach chair on a
beach smiling and not saying anything for days  resting  but it doesn t work very well 
he can t tell if hal is sad  he is having a harder and harder time reading hal s states of mind or whether he s in good spirits 

 this worries him  he used to be able to sort of preverbally know in his stomach generally where hal was and what he was doing 
even if hal was far away and playing or if mario was away  and now he can t anymore  feel it  this worries him and feels like
when you ve lost something important in a dream and you can t even remember what it was but it s important  mario loves hal so
much it makes his heart beat hard  he doesn t have to wonder if the difference now is him or his brother because mario never
changes 
he hadn t told the moms he was going to walk around after he left her office after their interface  avril usually tries in a
nonintrusive way to discourage mario from taking walks at night  because he doesn t see well at night  and the areas around the
e t a  hill are not the best neighborhood  and there s no skirting the fact that mario would be easy prey for just about anybody 
physically  and  though one perk of familial dysautonomia is a relative physical fearlessness        mario keeps to a pretty
limited area during insomniacal strolls  out of deference to avril s worry        he ll sometimes walk around the grounds of the
enfield marine p h h  at the bottom of the hill s east side because they re pretty much enclosed  the grounds are  and he knows a
couple of the e m  security officers from when his father got them to portray boston police in his whimsical dial c for
concupiscence  and he likes the e m  grounds at night because the different brick houses  window light is yellow
lamplight       and he can see people on the ground floors all together playing cards or talking or watching tp  he also likes
whitewashed brick regardless of its state of upkeep  and a lot of the people in the different brick houses are damaged or askew
and lean hard to one side or are twisted into themselves  through the windows  and he can feel his heart going out into the world
through them  which is good for insomnia  a woman s voice  calling for help without any real urgency   not like the screams that
signify the moms laughing or screaming at night   sounds from a darkened upper window  and across the little street that s
crammed with cars everybody has to move at     h  is ennet s house  where the headmistress has a disability and had had a
wheelchair ramp installed and has twice invited mario in during the day for a caffeine free millennial fizzy  and mario likes the
place  it s crowded and noisy and none of the furniture has protective plastic wrap  but nobody notices anybody else or comments
on a disability and the headmistress is kind to the people and the people cry in front of each other  the inside of it smells like an
ashtray  but mario s felt good both times in ennet s house because it s very real  people are crying and making noise and getting
less unhappy  and once he heard somebody say god with a straight face and nobody looked at them or looked down or smiled in
any sort of way where you could tell they were worried inside 
people from the public can t be in there after       though  because they have a curfew  so mario just totters past on the
broken sidewalk and looks in the ground windows at all the different people  every window is lit up with light and some are slid
partly open  and there is the noise of being outside a house full of people  from one of the upstairs windows facing the street
comes a voice going  give it here  give it here   someone is crying and someone else is either laughing or coughing very hard  an
irritable man s voice from a kitchen window at the side says something to somebody else that just said something like  so get
dentures   followed by curse words  another upstairs window  over at the side by the wheelchair ramp and the kitchen window
where the ground is soft enough to take the stress of a police lock and lead block nicely  the upper window has a billowing
lengthwise flag for a curtain and an old bumper sticker on the glass half scraped off so it says one day a in cursive  and mario
is arrested by the quiet but unmistakable sound of a recording of a broadcast of  sixty minutes more or less with madame
psychosis   which mario has never taped a show of because he feels it wouldn t be right for him but is strangely thrilled to hear
someone in ennet s thinking enough of to tape and replay  what s coming from behind the open window with a billowing flag for
a curtain is one of the old ones  from the year of the wonderchicken  madame s inaugural year  when she d sometimes talk all
hour and had an accent  a hard east wind blows mario s thin hair straight back off his head  his standing angle is      a female
girl in a little fur coat and uncomfortable looking bluejeans and tall shoes clicks past on the sidewalk and goes up the ramp into
ennet s back door without indicating she saw somebody with a really big head standing braced by a police lock on the lawn
outside the kitchen window  the lady had had on so much makeup she d looked unwell but the wake of her passage smells very
good  for some reason mario felt like the person behind the flag in the window was also a female  mario thinks it might not be
out of the question that she might lend tapes to a fellow listener if he could ask  he usually checks etiquette questions with hal 
who is incredibly knowledgeable and smart  when he thinks of hal his heart beats and his forehead s thick skin becomes wrinkled 
hal will also know the term for private tapes made of broadcast things on the air  perhaps this lady owns multiple tapes  this one
is from  sixty minutes       s first year  when madame still had a slight accent and often spoke on the show as if she were talking
exclusively to one person or character who was very important to her  the moms revealed that if you re not crazy then speaking to
someone who isn t there is termed apostrophe and is valid art  mario d fallen in love with the first madame psychosis programs
because he felt like he was listening to someone sad read out loud from yellow letters she d taken out of a shoebox on a rainy p m  
stuff about heartbreak and people you loved dying and u s  woe  stuff that was real  it is increasingly hard to find valid art that is
about stuff that is real in this way  the older mario gets  the more confused he gets about the fact that everyone at e t a  over the
age of about kent blott finds stuff that s really real uncomfortable and they get embarrassed  it s like there s some rule that real
stuff can only get mentioned if everybody rolls their eyes or laughs in a way that isn t happy  the worst feeling thing that
happened today was at lunch when michael pemulis told mario he had an idea for setting up a dial a prayer telephone service for
atheists in which the atheist dials the number and the line just rings and rings and no one answers  it was a joke and a good one 
and mario got it  what was unpleasant was that mario was the only one at the big table whose laugh was a happy laugh 
everybody else sort of looked down like they were laughing at somebody with a disability  the whole issue was far above mario s
head  and he was unable to understand lyle s replies when he tried to bring the confusion up  and hal was for once no help 
because hal seemed even more uncomfortable and embarrassed than the fellows at lunch  and when mario brought up real stuff
hal called him booboo and acted like he d wet himself and hal was going to be very patient about helping him change 
a lot of people are appearing out of the dark and walking by to go in for the curfew  they all seem afraid and scowl to
pretend they re not shy  the men have their hands in their coat pockets and the females have their hands at their coats  throats 
keeping them shut  one young person mario s never seen sees him struggling with the police lock and helps him disengage the bar
and get the lead block into his backpack  just that little bit of help that makes the difference  mario is suddenly so sleepy he s not
sure he can get up the hill to go home  the musics that played at the beginning of madame psychosis s career are the exact same
that played to the end  what sounds so unacceptable without her there 

 mario s forward list is perfect for walking up hills  however  his pelvis s salve makes a sound but doesn t hurt  in the big
protruding window of ennet s house s headmistress s office that the window overlooks the avenue and the train tracks and the
ngs  clean father and son grocery  where they give mario yellow tea in the a m  when he comes by when it s cold  the last thing
mario can see  before the hillside s trees close behind him and reduce the ennet house to shattered yellow lighting  is a wide
square headed boy bent over something he s writing at the headmistress s black desk  licking a pencil end and hunched all
uncomfortably with one arm curled out around what he s writing in  like a slow boy over a class theme at rindge and latin
special 
live in staffers  evening duties are divided pretty evenly between the picayune and the unpleasant  somebody has to hit the
area meetings to verify residents  attendance  while somebody else has to miss a nightly meeting to man the empty house and
phones and do the picayune daily log  after the meetings let out  gately s supposed to do a head count every hour and make a
log entry on who all s there and what s going on  gately has to do a chore patrol and log entry on chore performance and nail
down tomorrow s chore assignments off the weekly sheet  the residents need to have everything expected of them spelled out in
advance so they can t bitch if they get popped for something  then people who haven t performed on their chore have to be told
they re on a week s restriction  which tends to be unpleasant  gately has to unlock pat s cabinets and get the key to the meds
locker and open the meds locker  residents on meds respond to the sound of the meds locker the way a cat will respond to the
sound of a can opener  they just like materialize  gately has to dispense oral insulin and virus meds and pimple medicine and
antidepressants and lithium to the residents who materialize for meds  and then he has to enter everything in the medical log 
which the m  log is an incredible fucking mess  he has to get out pat s week at a glance book and print out her next day s
appointments on a sheet of paper in block letters  because pat finds her own palsied handwriting impossible to read  gately has to
confer with johnette foltz about how different residents conducted themselves at st  e  s sharing and caring and brookline s
b y p  and a women s na step down in east cambridge they let a couple of the senior females go to  and then log all the data 
gately has to go up and check on kate g   who claimed to be too sick to hit aa again tonight and has been in bed in her room
more or less steadily for three days  reading somebody called sylvia plate  going up onto the women s side of the upstairs is an
incredible pain in the ass because he has to unlock a little steel cage over a little button at the bottom of their stairway by the back
office and press the button to sound an upstairs buzzer and shout up the stairs  male on the floor  and then give the female
residents as much time as they need to get decent or whatever before he can come up 
going up there has been educational for gately because he d always had this idea that women s areas were essentially cleaner
and pleasanter than men s areas  having to verify the chore in the women s two bathrooms smashed his longstanding delusion that
women didn t go to the bathroom with the same appalling vigor that men did  gately d done a fair amount of cleaning up after his
mother  but he d never much thought of her as a woman  so the whole unpleasant thing s been an education 
gately has to check on doony glynn  who has recurrent diverticulitis and has to lie fetal on his bunk when he gets an attack
and has to be brought motrin and a slimfast shake that gately had to make with    milk because there was no skim left  and then
food bank crackers and a tonic out of the basement s machine when glynn can t drink the    shake  and then log glynn s
comments and condition  neither of which are good 
somebody has made those disgusting marshmallowy rice krispie things in the kitchen and then not cleaned up after
themselves  and gately has to clomp around finding out who s responsible and get them to clean it up  and the code about ratting
among the residents is such that you d think he was a narc all of a sudden  the daily bullshit here is hip deep and not so much
annoying as soul sucking  a double shift here now empties him out by dawn  just in time to clean real shit  it hadn t been this way
at the start  the soul sucking aspect  and gately every couple minutes wonders again what he ll end up doing when his year s staff
term is up and his soul is sucked out and he s sober but without any money and still clueless and has to leave here and do
something back out there 
kate gompert  when he buzzed and went up to the   woman room to look in  had made a possible sideways comment about
hurting herself        and gately has to call pat at home about it  and she s out or not picking up  so then he has to call the house
manager and relay the verbatim comment and let her interpret it and tell gately what action to take and how the comment stands
in relation to gompert s suicide contract and how the whole thing should be logged  a resident at ennet had hung herself from a
heating pipe in the basement a couple years before gately arrived  and there are now baroque procedures for monitoring ideation
among residents with psych issues  the number of   east at st  elizabeth s is on a red card in pat s rolodex 
gately has to collect the previous week s counselor reports and collate them and get the residents  files together and get any
updates or changes printed out and into the files for tomorrow s all staff meeting  where the staff gets together in pat s office and
interfaces on how each resident seems to be doing  residents have a pretty good idea that their alumni counselors basically rat
them out in toto at each staff meeting  which is why counselling sessions tend to be so incredibly dull that only really grateful
giving ennet alumni are willing to serve as counselors  filing organization is picayune  and for gately using the back office s tp
array to print stuff out is unpleasant  mostly because each of his fingers covers almost three keys of the keyboard and he has to hit
each key carefully with the tip of a pen  which sometimes he forgets to retract the nub of  leaving blue smears on the keys that the
house manager always gives him an ass chewing for 
and gately has to have each newer resident in to the office for at least a couple minutes to like touch base and see how
they re doing and make it clear they re regarded as existing so they can t just melt into the living room s decor and disappear  the
newest guy s still sitting in the linen closet claiming he s comfortablest there with the door open and the new  helpless  amy
johnson hasn t come back yet  a brand new court ordered female  ruth van cleve  who looks like one of those people you see in
pictures of african famine  has to fill out intake forms and go through orientation  and gately goes over the house rules with her
and gives her a copy of the ennet house survival guide  which some resident years gone had written for pat 
gately has to answer the phone and tell people who call the office for a resident that residents can receive calls only on the
pay phone in the basement  which he has to say yes is frequently busy all the time  the house prohibits cellular mobiles and has a
boundary about the office phone for residents  gately has to kick residents off down there when other residents in line come and
complain they ve exceeded their five minutes  this also tends to be unpleasant  the pay phone down there is undigital and unshutoffable and a constant source of aggravation and beefs  every conversation is life and death  crisis down there       there s a

 special way to kick somebody off a pay phone that s respectful and nonshaming but also firm  gately has gotten good at assuming
a blank but not passive expression when residents are abusive  there s this look of weary expertise the house staffers cultivate 
then have to flex their face to get rid of when they re off duty  gately s gotten so stoic in the face of abuse that a resident has to
mention actual unnatural acts in connection with his name for gately to log the abuse and give out a restriction  he s respected
and well liked by almost all the residents  which the house manager says causes the veteran staff some concern  because gately s
job is not to be these people s friend all the time 
then in the kitchen with the fucking krispie treat bowls and pans still a fucking mess wade mcdade and some other
residents were standing around waiting for various things to toast and boil and mcdade was using his finger and pushing the tip of
his nose up so that his nostrils faced straight out at everybody  he was looking piggishly around and asking if people knew any
people where their nose looked like this right here  and some people said yes  sure  why  gately checked the fridge and again saw
evidence that his special meatloaf had a secret admirer  it looked like  another big rectangle cut out of the leftovers he d carefully
wrapped and laid out on the sturdiest shelf in there  mcdade  who gately struggles daily with the urge to hit mcdade so hard
there d be nothing but eyes and a nose down over the tops of his cowboy boots  mcdade s telling everybody he s constructing a
gratitude list at calvin t  s tough love suggestion and he says he s decided one of the things he s grateful for is his nose don t
look like this here  gately tries not to judge on the basis of who laughs and who doesn t  when pat s phone rings and gately
leaves  mcdade s squunching his upper lip up in his hand and asking people about acquaintance with cleft palates 
gately has to monitor the like emotional barometer in the house and put a wet finger to the wind for potential conflicts and
issues and rumors  a subtle art here is maintaining access to the residents  gossip grapevine and keeping on top of rumors without
seeming like you re inducing a resident to cross the line and actually eat cheese on another resident  the only thing a resident is
actually encouraged to rat out another resident on here is picking up a substance  all other type issues it s supposed to be staff s
job to glean and ferret out etc   to decoct legitimate infractions out of the tides of innuendo and bullshit complaint     bored
crammed together street canny people in detox from wrecked lives can generate  rumors that so and so blew so and so on the
couch at       that thus and such s got a knife  that x was using what had to be some kind of code on the pay phone  that y s gone
back to carrying a beeper  that so and so s making book on football out of the   man room  that belbin had led diehl to believe
she d clean up if he made krispie treats and then she weaseled out  and etc  almost all of it s picayune and  over time  as it
accretes  unpleasant 
rarely a feeling of outright unalloyed sadness as such  afterward   just an abrupt loss of hope  plus there is the contempt he
belies so well with gentleness and caring during that post coital period of small sounds and adjustments 
orin can only give  not receive  pleasure  and this makes a contemptible number of them think he is a wonderful lover  almost
a dream type lover  and this fuels the contempt  but he cannot show the contempt  since this would pretty clearly detract from the
subject s pleasure 
because the subject s pleasure in him has become his food  he is conscientious in the consideration and gentleness he shows
after coitus  making clear his desire to stay right there very close and be intimate  when so many other male lovers  the subjects
say  seem afterward to become uneasy  contemptuous  or distant  rolling over to stare at the wall or tamping down a smoke before
they ve even stopped twitching 
the hand model told him very softly how the photograph s big pink swiss husband after coitus hove himself off her and lay
there stunned under his stomach s weight  his eyes narrowed to piggy slits and the faint smirk on his face that of a gorged predator 
not like the punter  uncaring  as was s o p  with subjects she became then briefly stricken and anxious and said no one must ever
know  she could lose her children  orin administered the standard assurances in a very soft intimate voice  orin was resoundingly
gentle and caring afterward  as she could somehow just intuitively tell he would be  it was true  it gave him real pleasure to give
the impression of care and intimacy in this interval  if someone asked about his favorite part of the anticlimactic time after the
subject lay back and glisteningly opened and he could see her eyes holding him whole  orin would say his    favorite is this postseminal interval of clingy vulnerability on the subject s part and gentle intimate care on his own 
when the knock on the room door came it seemed like a further grace  for the subject had been up on an elbow in bed 
exhaling slim tusks of cigarette smoke from her nose and starting to ask him to tell her things about his own family  and orin was
stroking her very tenderly and watching the twin curves of smoke pale and spread and trying not to shudder at the thought of what
the inside of the subject s fine nose must look like  what gray white tangles of necrotic snot must hang and twine up in there  from
the smoke  whether she had the stomach to look at a hankie she d used or whether she balled the thing up and flung it from her
with the sort of shudder o  knew he d feel  and when the brisk action of male knuckles sounded against the room s door he
watched her face whiten from the forehead down as she pleaded that no one must know of her whoever was there and stabbed out
her butt and dove beneath the blankets as he called out for patience to the door and veered to the bathroom to wrap a towel around
him before he went to it  the sort of bland hotel door you used a card and not a key for  the defiled  guilty  and frightened married
hand model s wrist and hand protruded for a moment from the edge of the bedding and felt the floor for shoes and clothes  the
hand moving like a blind spider and sucking things up under the blankets  orin didn t ask who it was at the door  be had nothing to
hide  his mood at the door became extraordinarily fine  when the wife and mother had erased all evidence of herself and heaped
the bedding over her so she could lie there sniffing grayly and imagining that she was hidden from view  just one lumpy part of a
celibate napper s dishevelled bed  orin checked the door s fish eye peeper  saw only the hallway s claret colored wall opposite 
and opened the door with a smile he felt all the way down to his bare soles  swiss cuckolds  furtive near eastern medical attaches 
zaftig print journalists  he felt ready for anything 
the man in the hall at the door was handicapped  challenged  in a wheelchair  looking up at him from well below peepholerange  bushy haired and mostly nose and looking up into the swell of orin s pectorals  making no attempt to see around him into
the room  one of the disabled  orin looked down and felt both let down and almost touched  the little fellow s wheelchair shiny
and his lap blanketed and his string tie half hidden by the clipboard he held to his chest with a curled and motherly arm 
 survey   the man said  nothing else  joggling the clipboard a little like an infant  presenting it as evidence 
orin imagined the terrified subject lying there hidden and trying to hear  and despite a sort of mild disappointment he felt
touched at whatever this shy ruse of an excuse for proximity to his leg and autograph might be  he felt for the subject the sort of

 clinical contempt you feel for an insect you ve looked down and seen and know you re going to torture for a while  from the way
she smoked and performed certain other manual operations  orin d noted she was left handed 
he said to the man in the wheelchair   goody  
 plus or minus three percent sample  
 eager to cooperate in any way  
the man cocked his head in that way people in wheelchairs do   scholarly academic study

no shins or extremities  however withery  extended below the wheelchair s blanket s hem  the guy was like totally legless  orin s

 i m clearing my mind to be of maximum help  
when the man had taken out his pen with a flourish and looked down at his board orin got a look at the yarmulke of skin in
the center of the seated man s hair  there was something almost unbearably touching about a bald spot on a handicapped man 
 what do you miss  please  
orin smiled coolly   very little  i like to think  
 backtrack  u s a  citizen  
 yes  
 you have how many years  
 age  
 you have which age  
 age is twenty six  
 over twenty five  
 that d follow   orin was waiting for the ruse involving the pen that d get him to sign something so the very shy fan club d get
their autograph  he tried to remember from mario s childhood how long under blankets before it got unbearably hot and you
started to smother and thrash 
the man pretended to notate   employed  self employed  unemployed  
orin smiled   the first  
 please list what you miss  
the whisper of the vent  hush of the wine colored hallway  vaguest whisper of rustling sheets behind  imagining the growing
bubble of co  under the sheets 
 please list lifestyle elements of your u s a  lifetime you recall  and or at present lack  and miss  
tm not sure i follow  
the man flipped a page over to check   pine  yearn  winsome  nostalgia  lump of throat   flipping one more sheet   wistful  as
well  
 you mean childhood memories  you mean like cocoa with half melted marshmallows floating on top in a checker tiled
kitchen warmed by an enamel gas range  that sort of thing  or omnissent doors at airports and star markets that somehow knew
you were there and slid open  before they disappeared  where did those doors go  
 enamel is with the e  
 and then some  
orin s gaze now was up at the ceiling s acoustic tile  the little blinking disk of the hall s smoke detector  as if memories were
always lighter than air  the seated man stared blandly up at the throb of orin s internal jugular vein  orin s face changed a little 
behind him  under the blankets  the non swiss woman lay very calmly and patiently on her side  breathing silently into the
portable oz mask w  canister from the purse beside her  one hand in the purse on the schmeisser gbf miniature machine pistol 
 i miss tv   orin said  looking back down  he no longer smiled coolly 
 the former television of commercial broadcast  
 i do  
 reason in several words or less  please  for the box after reason   displaying the board 
 oh  man   orin looked back up and away at what seemed to be nothing  feeling at his jaw around the retromandibular s much
tinier and more vulnerable throb   some of this may sound stupid  i miss commercials that were louder than the programs  i miss
the phrases  order before midnight tonight  and  save up to fifty percent and more   i miss being told things were filmed before a
live studio audience  i miss late night anthems and shots of flags and fighter jets and leathery faced indian chiefs crying at litter  i
miss  sermonette  and  evensong  and test patterns and being told how many megahertz something s transmitter was
broadcasting at   he felt his face   i miss sneering at something i love  how we used to love to gather in the checker tiled kitchen
in front of the old boxy cathode ray sony whose reception was sensitive to airplanes and sneer at the commercial vapidity of
broadcast stuff  
 vapid ditty   pretending to notate 
 i miss stuff so low denominator i could watch and know in advance what people were going to say  
 emotions of mastery and control and superiority  and pleasure  
 you can say that again  boy  i miss summer reruns  i miss reruns hastily inserted to fill the intervals of writers  strikes  actors 
guild strikes  i miss jeannie  samantha  sam and diane  gilligan  hawkeye  hazel  jed  all the syndicated airwave haunters  you
know  i miss seeing the same things over and over again  
there were two muffled sneezes from the bed behind him that the handicapped man didn t even acknowledge  pretending to

 write  brushing his string tie s dangle away again and again as he wrote  orin tried not to imagine the topography of the sheets the
subject d sneezed into  he no longer cared about the ruse  he did feel tender  somehow  toward him 
the man tended to look up at him like people with legs look up at buildings and planes   you can of course view
entertainments again and again without surcease on telentertainment disks of storage and retrieval  
orin s way of looking up as he remembered was nothing like the seated guy s way of looking up   but not the same  the
choice  see  it ruins it somehow  with television you were subjected to repetition  the familiarity was inflicted  different now  
 inflicted  
 i don t think i exactly know   orin said  suddenly dimly stunned and sad inside  the terrible sense as in dreams of something
vital you ve forgotten to do  the inclined head s bald spot was freckled and tan   is there a next item  
 things to tell me you do not miss  
 for symmetry  
 balance of opinion  
orin smiled   plus or minus  
 just so   the man said 
orin resisted an urge to lay his hand tenderly over the arc of the disabled man s skull   well how much time do we have here  
the skyscraper gawking aspect was only when the man s gaze went higher than orin s neck  they were not shy or indirect or
even the eyes of someone in any way disabled  was what struck orin later as odd   besides the swiss accent  the absence of a
signature ruse  the subject s patience with the wait and the absence of gasping when o  pulled the covers abruptly back  later  the
man had looked up at orin and flicked his eyes slightly past him  at the room behind with pantyless floor and humped covers 
orin was meant to see the glance past him   can return at later time which we specify  you are  comme on dit  engaged  
orin s smile wasn t as cool as he thought as he told the seated figure that that was a matter of opinion 
as at all d s a s  certified halfway facilities  ennet house s resident curfew is     h  from      to       the staffer on
night duty has to do head counts and sit around like somebody s mom waiting for different residents to come in  there s always
ones that always like to cut it close and play with the idea of getting discharged for something picayune so it won t be their fault 
tonight clenette h  and the deeply whacked out yolanda w  come back in from footprints       around      in purple skirts
and purple lipstick and ironed hair  tottering on heels and telling each other what a wicked time they just had  hester thrale
undulates in in a false fox jacket at      as usual even though she has to be up at like      for the breakfast shift at the provident
nursing home and sometimes eats breakfast with gately  both of their faces nodding down perilously close to their frosted
flakes  chandler foss and the spectrally thin april cortelyu come in from someplace with postures and expressions that arouse
comments and force gately to log a possible issue about an in house relationship  gately has to bid goodnight to two craggyfaced brunette ex residents who ve been planted on the couch all night talking cults  emil minty and nell gunther and sometimes
gavin diehl  who gately did three weeks of a municipal bit with  once  at concord farm  make a nightly point of going to smoke
outside on the front porch and coming in only after gately says twice he s got to lock the door  just as some limp rebellious
gesture  tonight they re closely followed by a mus tacheless lenz  who sort of oozes through the door just as gately s going
through his keys to get the key to lock it  and kind of brushes by and goes up to the   man without a word  which he s been doing
a lot lately  which gately has to log  plus the fact that it s now after      and he can t account for either the semi new girl amy j 
or   more upsetting   bruce green  then green knocks at the front door at        gately has to log the exact time and then
it s his call whether to unlock the door  after curfew staff doesn t have to unlock the door  many a bad news resident gets
effectively bounced this way  gately lets him in  green s never come close to missing curfew before and looks godawful  skin
potato white and eyes vacant  and a big quiet kid is one thing  but green looks at the floor of pat s office like it s a loved one
while gately gives him the required ass chewing  and green takes the standard dreaded week s full house restriction       in
such a vacantly hangdog way  and is so lamely vague when gately asks does he want to tell him where he s been at and why he
couldn t make      and whether there s anything that s an issue that he might want to share with staff  so unresponsive that gately
feels like he has no choice but to pull an immediate spot urine on green  which gately hates doing not only because he plays
cribbage with green and feels like he s taken green under the old gately wing and is probably the closest thing to a sponsor the
kid s got but also because urine samples taken after unit    s clinic s closed       have to be stored overnight in the little staff
miniature fridgelette in don gately s basement room   the only fridge in the house that no resident could conceivably dicky into
  and gately hates to have a warm blue lidded cup of somebody s goddamn urine in his fridgelette with his pears and polar seltzer  etc  green submits to gately s cross armed presence in the men s head as green produces a urine so efficiently and with so
little bullshit that gately is able to take the lidded cup between gloved thumb and finger and get it downstairs and tagged and
logged and down in the fridgelette in time to not be late for getting the residents  cars moved  the night shift s biggest pain in the
ass  but then his final head count at      reminds gately that amy j  isn t back  and she hasn t called  and pat has told him the
decision to discharge after a missed curfew is his call  and at      gately makes the decision  and has to get treat and belbin to
go up into the   woman room and pack the girl s stuff up in the same irish luggage she d brought it in monday  and gately has to
put the trashbags on the front porch with a quick note explaining the discharge and wishing the girl good luck  and has to call
pat s answering device down in milton and leave word of a mandatory curfew discharge at     h   so pat can hear about it first
thing in the a m  and schedule interviews to fill the available bed asap  and then with a hissed curse gately remembers the antibig hanging gut situps he s sworn to himself to do every night before       and it s       and he has time to do only    with his
huge discolored sneakers wedged under the frame of the office s black vinyl couch before it s unavoidably time to supervise
moving the residents  cars around 
gately s predecessor as male live in staff  a designer narcotics man who s now  via mass rehab  learning to repair jet engines
at east coast aerotech  once described residents  vehicles to gately as a continuing boil on the ass of night staff  ennet house
jets any resident with a legally registered vehicle and insurance keep their car at the house  if they want  during residency  to use
for work and nightly meetings  etc   and the enfield marine public health hospital goes along  except they put authorized parking
for all the units  clients out in the little street right outside the house  and since metro boston s serious fiscal troubles in the third
year of subsidized time there s been this hellish municipal deal where only one side of any street is legal for parking  and the

 legal side switches abruptly at     h   and cruisers and municipal tow trucks prowl the streets from     h  on  writing       
tickets and or towing suddenly illegally parked vehicles to a region of the south end so blasted and dangerous no cabbie with
anything to live for will even go there  so the interval     h  ooo h  in boston is a time of total but not very spiritual
community  with guys in skivvies and ladies in mud masks staggering out yawning into the crowded midnight streets and
disabling their alarms and revving and all trying to pull out and do a u and find a parallel parking place facing the other way 
there s nothing very mysterious about the fact that metro boston s battery  and homicide rates during this ten minute interval are
the highest per diem  so that ambulances and paddy wagons are especially aprowl at this hour  too  adding to the general clot and
snarl 
since the e m p h h  units  catatonics and enfeebled people rarely own registered vehicles  it s generally pretty easy to find
places along the little road to switch to  but it s a constant sore point between pat montesian and the e m p h h  board of regents
that ennet house residents don t get to park overnight in the big off street lot by the condemned hospital building   the lot s
spaces are reserved for all the different units  professional staff starting at     h   and e m  security got sick of staffs  complaints
about drug addicts  poorly maintained autos still sitting there taking up their spots in the a m    and that security won t consider
changing the little e m  streetlet s nightly side switch to     h   before ennet houses s d s a s  required curfew  e m  s board
claims it s a municipal ordinance that they can t be expected to mess with just to accommodate one tenant  while pat s memos keep
pointing out that the enfield marine hospital complex is state  not city owned  and that ennet house residents are the only tenants
who face the nightly car moving problem  since just about everyone else is catatonic or enfeebled  and so on 
but so every p m  at like      gately has to lock up the lockers and pat s cabinets and desk drawers and the door to the front
office and put the phone console s answering machine on and personally escort all residents who own cars out post curfew outside
into the little nameless streetlet  and for somebody with gately s real limited managerial skills the headaches involved are
daunting  he has to herd the vehicular residents together just inside the locked front door  he has to threaten the residents he s
herded together into staying together by the door while he clomps upstairs to get the one or two drivers who always forget and fall
asleep before        and this straggler collecting is a particular pain in the ass if the straggler s a female  because he has to
unlock and press the male coming up button by the kitchen  and the  buzzer  sounds more like a klaxon  and wakes the edgiest
female residents up with an ugly surge of adrenaline  and gately as he clomps up the stairs gets roundly bitched out by all the
mud masked heads sticking out into the female hall  and he by regulation can t go into the sleeper s bedroom but has to pound on
the door and keep shouting out his gender and get one of the straggler s roommates to wake her up and get her dressed and to the
bedroom door  so he has to retrieve the stragglers and chew them out and threaten them with both a restriction and a possible tow
while herding them quick walking down the staircase to join the main car owner herd as quickly as possible before the main herd
can like disperse  they ll always disperse if he takes too long getting stragglers  they ll get distracted or hungry or need an ashtray
or just get impatient and start looking at the whole car moving after curfew thing as an imposition on their time  their earlyrecovery denial makes it impossible for them to imagine their own car getting towed instead of  say  somebody else s car  it s the
same denial gately can see at work in the younger b u  or  c  students when he s driving pat s aventura to the food bank or
purity supreme when they ll fucking walk right out in the street against the light in front of the car  whose brakes are fortunately
in top shape  gately s snapped to the fact that people of a certain age and level of like life experience believe they re immortal 
college students and alcoholics addicts are the worst  they deep down believe they re exempt from the laws of physics and
statistics that ironly govern everybody else  they ll piss and moan your ear off if somebody else fucks with the rules  but they
don t deep down see themselves subject to them  the same rules  and they re constitutionally unable to learn from anybody else s
experience  if some jaywalking b u  student does get splattered on comm  or some house resident does get his car towed at      
your other student s or addict s response to this will be to ponder just what imponderable difference makes it possible for that other
guy to get splattered or towed and not him  the ponderer  they never doubt the difference   they just ponder it  it s like a kind of
idolatry of uniqueness  it s unvarying and kind of spirit killing for a staffer to watch  that the only way your addict ever learns
anything is the hard way  it has to happen to them to like upset the idolatry  eugenio m  and annie parrot always recommend
letting everybody get towed at least once  early on in their residency  to help make believers out of them in terms of laws and
rules  but gately for some reason on his night shifts can t do it  cannot fucking stand to have one of his people get towed as long
as there s something he can do to prevent it  and then plus if they do get towed there s the nail chewing hassle of arranging their
transport to the south end s municipal lot the next day  fielding calls from bosses and supplying verification of residents 
carlessness in terms of getting to work without letting the boss know that the earless employee is a resident of a halfway house 
which is totally sacred private residents  private information to give out or not   gately breaks a full body sweat just thinking
about the managerial headaches involved in a fucking tow  so he ll spend time herding and regathering and chewing the
absentminded asses of residents who gene m  says have such calloused asses still it s a waste of gately s time and spirit  you have
to let them learn for themselves        gately alerts thrale and foss and erdedy and henderson        and morris hanley  and
drags the new kid tingley out of the linen closet  and nell gunther   who s fucking sacked out slack mouthed on the couch  in
violation   and lets them all get coats and herds them together by the locked front door  yolanda w  says she left personal items
in clenette s car and can she come  lenz owns a car but doesn t answer gately s yell up the stairs  gately tells the herd to stay put
and that if anybody leaves the herd he s going to take a personal interest in their discomfort  gately clomps up the stairs and into
the   man room  plotting different fun ways to wake lenz up without bruises that d show  lenz is not asleep but is wearing
personal stereo headphones  plus a jock strap  doing handstand pushups up against the wall by geoffrey day s rack  his bottom
only inches from day s pillow and farting in rhythm to the pushups  downstrokes  as day lies there in pajamas and lone ranger
sleep mask  hands folded over his heaving chest  lips moving soundlessly  gately s maybe a little rough about grabbing lenz s calf
and lifting him off his hands and using his other big hand on lenz s hip to twirl him around upright like a drill team s rifle  but
lenz s cry is of over ebullient greeting  not pain  but it sends both day and gavin diehl bolt upright in their racks  and then they
curse as lenz hits the floor  lenz starts saying he d let time completely get away from him and didn t know what time it was 
gately can hear the herd down by the front door at the bottom of the stairs stamping and chuffing and getting ready to maybe
disperse 
up this close  gately doesn t even need his staffer s eerie seventh sense to sense that lenz is clearly wired on either  drines or

 bing  that lenz has been visited by the sergeant at arms  lenz s right eyeball is wobbling around in its socket and his mouth
writhing in that way and he has that nietzschean supercharged aura of a wired individual  and all the time he s throwing on slacks
and topcoat and incognitoizing wig and getting almost pitched headfirst down the stairs by gately he s telling this insane
breathless whopper about his finger once getting cut off and then spontaneously regentrifying itself back on  and his mouth is
writhing in that fish on a gaff way distinctive of a sustained l dopa surge  and gately wants to pull an immediate urine 
immediate  but meanwhile the cars  herd s edges are just starting to widen in that way that precedes distraction and dispersal  and
they re angry not at lenz for straggling but at gately for even bothering with him  and lenz pantomimes the akido serene but
deadly crane stance at ken erdedy  and it s     h  and gately can see tow trucks aprowl way down on comm  ave   coming this
way  and he jangles his keys and unlocks all three curfew locks on the front door and gets everybody out in the scrotum tightening
november cold and out down the walk to the line of their cars in the little street and stands there on the porch watching in just
orange shirtsleeves  making sure lenz doesn t bolt before he can pull a spot urine and extract an admission and discharge him
officially  feeling a twinge of conscience at so looking forward to giving lenz the administrative shoe  and lenz jabbers nonstop
to whoever s closest all the way to his duster  and everybody goes to their car  and the backwash around gately from the open
house door is hot and people in the living room provide loud feedback on the draft from the open door  the sky overhead immense
and dimensional and the night so clear you can see stars hanging in a kind of lacteal goo  and out on the streetlet a couple car
doors are squeaking and slamming and some people are conversing and delaying just to make staff have to stand there in
shirtsleeves on the cold porch  a small nightly sideways ball busting rebellious gesture  when gately s eye falls on doony r 
glynn s specialty disembowelled old dusty black vw bug parked with the other cars on the now illicit street side  its rear mount
engine s guts on full glittered display under the little street s lights  and glynn s upstairs in bed tonight legitimately prostrate with
diverticulitis  which for insurance reasons means gately has to go back in and ask some resident with a driver s license to come
move glynn s vw across the street  which is humiliating because it means admitting publicly to these specimens that he  gately 
doesn t have a valid license  and the sudden heat of the living room confuses his goose pimples  and nobody in the living room
will admit to have a driver s license  and it turns out the only licensed resident who s still vertical and downstairs is bruce green 
who s in the kitchen expressionlessly stirring a huge amount of sugar into a cup of coffee with his bare blunt finger  and gately
finds himself having to ask for managerial assistance from a kid he likes and has just bitched out and extracted urine from  which
green minimizes the humiliation of the whole thing by volunteering to help the second he hears the words glynn and fucking car 
and goes to the living room closet to get out his cheap leather jacket and fingerless gloves  and but gately now has to leave the
residents outside still unsupervised for a second to go clomping upstairs and verify that it s kosher with glynn for bruce green to
move his car        the   man seniorest males  bedroom has a bunch of old aa bumper stickers on it and a calligraphic poster
saying everything i ve ever let go of has claw marks on it  and the answer to gately s knock is a moan  and
glynn s little naked lady bedside lamp he brought in with him is on  he s in his rack curled on his side clutching his abdomen like
a kicked man  mcdade is illicitly sitting on foss s rack reading one of foss s motorcycle magazines and drinking glynn s
millennial fizzy with stereo headphones on  and he hurriedly puts out his cigarette when gately enters and closes the little drawer
in the bedside table where foss keeps his ashtray just like everybody else        the street outside sounds like daytona   a
drug addict is like physically unable to start a car without gunning the engine  gately looks quickly out the west window over
glynn s rack to verify that all the unsupervised headlights going down the little street are uing and coming back the right way to
repark  gately s forehead is wet and he feels the start of a greasy headache  from managerial stress  glynn s crossed eyes are
glassy and feverish and he s softly singing the lyrics to a choosy mothers song to a tune that isn t the song s tune 
 doon   gately whispers 
one of the cars is coming back down the street a little fast for gately s taste  anything involving residents that happens on the
grounds after curfew is his responsibility  the house manager s made clear 
 doon  
it s the bottom eye  grotesquely  that rolls up at gately   don

bowelmobile  
the heat coming off glynn is face tightening 
 you feel like you got a fever  doon   at one point elements of staff thought glynn might be playing sick to get out of
looking for a job after losing his menial job at brighton fence   wire  all gately knows about diverticulitis is that pat said it s
intestinal and alcoholics can get it in recovery from impurities in bottom shelf blends that the body s trying to expel  glynn s had
physical complaints all through his residency  but nothing like this here  his face is gray and waxy with pain and there s a
yellowish crust on his lips  glynn s got a real severe adtorsion  and the bottom eye is rolled up at gately with a terrible delirious
glitter  the top eye rolling around like a cow s eye  gately still cannot bring himself to feel another man s forehead  he settles for
punching glynn very lightly on the shoulder 
 you think we need to take you over to st  e  s to get your intestine looked at  doon  do you think  
 hoits  don  

  you think you    
because he s worrying about what if a resident comas or dies on his shift  and then feeling shame that this is his worry  the
squeal of brakes and raised voices  noises down out front hasn t registered on gately right away  but hester thrale s unmistakable
high b  scream does   i e  register   and now serious feet running up the stairs 
green s face in the doorway  red in round patches high on his cheeks   come out  
 the fuck s the problem out   
green   come now gately  
glynn sotto   mother  
gately doesn t get to even ask green what the fuck again on the stairs because green is down ahead out the door so fast  the
damn front door s been open all this time  a watercolor of a retrieverish dog cants and then falls from the wall on the staircase
from the vibrations of gately taking two stairs down at a time  he doesn t take time to grab his coat off pat s couch  all he s got on
is a donated orange bowling shirt with the name moose cursive stitched on the breast and shuco mist m p s  in ghastly aqua
blocks across the back        and he feels every follicle on his body hump up again as the cold encases him on the front porch
and the wheelchair ramp down to the little walkway  the night is cold and glycerine clear and quite still  very distant sounds of
car horns and raised voices down on comm  green s receding at a run off up the little streetlet into a glare of highbeams that
diffracts in the clouds of gately s breath  so even as gately walks briskly       in green s leather smelling backwash toward a
rising hubbub of curses and lenz s high speed voice and thrale s glass shattering cries and henderson and willis talking shit
angrily to somebody and the sound of joelle v d  s veiled head in an upstairs window that isn t the   women room s shouting
something down to gately as he appears in the street  even as he closes in it takes a while for the scene to decoct out of the fog of
his breath and its shifting spears of color against the headlights  he passes glynn s disembowelled and illegally parked bug 
several of the residents  cars are idling at haphazard angles of mid u turn in the middle of the street  and in front of them is a
modified dark montego with highbeams and jacked rear wheels and a turbo s carnivorous idle  two almost gately sized bearded
guys in loose like bowling wear shirts with flowers or suns on them and what look like big faggy necklaces of flowers around
what would be their necks if they had necks turn out to be chasing randy lenz around this montego car  yet another guy with a
necklace and a plaid donegal is holding the rest of the residents at bay on the lawn of    with a nasty looking item      
expertly held  everything now slightly slows down  at the sight of an item held on his residents there s almost a kind of
mechanistic click as gately s mind shifts into a different kind of drive  he gets very cool and clear and his headache recedes and
his breathing slows  it s not so much that things slow as break into frames 
the ruckus has aroused the old nurse in    who asks for help  and her spectral figure is splayed in a nightie against an
upstairs    window yelling  eeeeeeeyelp   hester thrale now has her pink nailed hands over her eyes and is screaming over and
over for nobody to hurt nobody especially her  it s the bulldog item that holds the attention  the two guys chasing lenz around
the montego are unarmed but look coldly determined in a way gately recognizes  they re not wearing coats either but they don t
look cold  all this appraisal s taking only seconds  it only takes time to list it  they have vaguely non u s  beards and are each
about   s gately s size  they take turns coming around the car and running past the headlights  glare and gately can see they have
similar froggy lippy pale foreign faces  lenz is talking at the guys nonstop  mostly imprecating  they re all three going around and
around the car like a cartoon  gately s still walking up as he sees all this  it s obvious to appraisal the foreignish guys aren t real
bright because of they re chasing lenz in tandem instead of heading around the car in opposite directions to trap him in like a
pincer  they all three stop and start  lenz across the car from them  some of the at bay residents are yelling to lenz  like most
coke dealers lenz is quick on his feet  his topcoat billowing and then settling whenever he stops  lenz s voice is nonstop   he s
alternately inviting the guy to perform impossible acts and advancing baroque arguments for how whatever they think he did
there s no way he was even in the same area code as whatever happened that they think he did  the guys keep speeding up like
they want to catch lenz just to shut him up  ken erdedy has his hands up and his car keys in his hand  his legs look like he s about
to wet himself  clenette and the new black girl  clearly veterans at gunpoint etiquette  are prone on the lawn with their fingers
laced behind their heads  nell gunther s assumed lenz s old martial arts crane stance  hands twisted into flat claws  eyeing the
guy s      which pans coolly back and forth over the residents  this smaller guy gets the most frames the slowest  he s got on a
plaid hunting cap that keeps gately from seeing if he s foreign also  but the guy s holding the weapon in the classic weaver stance
of somebody that can really shoot   left foot slightly forward  slightly hunched  a two handed grip with the right arm cocked
elbow out so the item s held high up in front of the guy s face  up to his sighting eye  this is how policemen and made guys from
the north end shoot  gately knows weapons way better than sobriety  still  and the item   if the guy trig pulls on some resident
that resident s going down   the item s some customized version of a u s      bulldog special  or maybe a nuck or brazilian
clone  blunt and ugly and with a bore like the mouth of a cave  the stout alcoholic kid tingley has both hands to his cheeks and is
     at bay  the piece s been modified  gately can appraise  the barrel s been vented out near the muzzle to cut your bulldog s
infamous recoil  the hammer s bobbed  and the thing s got a fat mag na port or  clone grip like the metro finest favor  this is not
a weekend warrior or liquor store holdup type item  it s one that s made real specifically for putting projectiles into people  it s not
a semiauto but is throated for a fucking speed loader  which gately can t see if the guy s got a speed loader under the loose floral
shirt but needs to assume the guy s got near unlimited shots with a speed loader  the north shore finest on the other hand wrap
their grips in this like colored gauze that wicks sweat  gately tries to recall a past associate s insufferable ammo lectures when
under the influence   your bulldog and clones can take anything from light target loads and wadcutter to colt softip dum dums
and worse  he s pretty sure this thing could put him down with one round  he s not sure  gately s never been shot but he s seen
guys shot  he feels something that is neither fear nor excitement  joelle van d  is shouting stuff you can t make out  and erdedy at
bay on the lawn s calling out to her to get her head out of the whole picture  gately s been bearing down this whole brief time 
both seeing his breath and hearing it  beating his arms across his chest to keep some feeling in his hands  you could almost call
what he feels a kind of jolly calm  the unamerican guys chase lenz and then stop across the car facing him for a second and then
get furious again and chase him  gately guesses he ought to be grateful the third guy doesn t come over and just shoot him  lenz
puts both hands on whatever part of the car he stops at and sends language out across the car at the two guys  lenz s white wig is
askew and he s got no mustache  you can see  e m  security  normally so scrupulous with their fucking trucks at     h   is

 nowhere around  lending weight to yet another cliche  if you asked gately what he was feeling right this second he d have no idea 
he s got a hand up shading his eyes and closes on the montego as things further clarify  one of the guys now you can see has
lenz s disguise s mustache in two fingers and keeps holding it up and brandishing it at lenz  the other guy issues stilted but
colorful threats in a canadian accent  so it emerges on gately it s nucks  the trio lenz has managed to somehow enrage is nucks 
gately cops a black surge of remember whenning  the babbling little football head quebecer he d killed by gagging a man with a
bad cold  this line of thinking is intolerable  joelle s overhead shout to for christ s sake somebody call pat mixes in and out of the
help lady s cries  it occurs to gately that the help lady has cried wolf for so many years that real shouts for real help are all going
to be ignored  the residents all look to gately as he crosses the street directly into the montego s wash of light  hester thrale
screams out look out there s a item  the plaid hat nuck pans stiffly to sight at gately  his elbow up around his ear  it occurs to
gately if you fire with an item right up to your sighting eye like that won t you get a face full of cordite  there s a break in the
circular action around the throbbing car as lenz shouts don with great gusto just as the help lady shouts for help  the nuck with
the item has backed up several steps to keep the residents in his peripheral vision while he sights square on gately as the massive
nuck holding the mustache across the car tells gately if he was him he d return to whence he came  him  to avoid the trouble 
gately nods and beams  nucks really do pronounce the with a z  both the car and lenz are between gately and the large nucks 
lenz s back to gately  gately stands quietly  wishing he felt different about potential trouble  less almost jolly  late in gately s
substance and burglary careers  when he d felt so low about himself  he d had sick little fantasies of saving somebody from harm 
some innocent party  and getting killed in the process and getting eulogized at great length in bold faced globe print  now lenz
breaks away from the hood of the car and dashes gately s way and around behind him to stand behind him  spreading his arms
wide to put a hand on each of gately s shoulders  using don gately like a shield  gately s stance has the kind of weary resolution
of like you ll have to go through me  the only anxious part of him can see the log entry he ll have to make if residents come to
physical grief on his shift  for a moment he can almost smell the smells of the penitentiary  armpits and pomade and sour food
and cribbage board wood and reefer and mopwater  the rich piss stink of a zoo s lion house  the smell of the bars you lace your
hands through and stand there  looking out  this line of thinking is intolerable  he s neither goosepimpled nor sweating  his
senses haven t been this keen in over a year  the stars in their jelly and dirty sodium lamplight and stark white steer horns of
headlights splayed at residents  different angles  star chocked sky  his breath  faraway horns  low trill of athscmes way to the
north  thin keen cold air in his wide open nose  motionless heads at    s windows 
the nuck duo with flowers chasing lenz come around this side and now break away from the car toward them  now hester
thrale at gately s right periphery breaks away from the cluster and runs for it off into the night across the lawn and behind    
waving her arms and screaming  and minty and mcdade and parias carbo and charlotte treat appear out of ennet house s back
door across the hedge and mill and jostle amid the mops and old furniture on ennet s back porch  watching  and a couple of the
more mobile catatonics appear on the porch of the shed across the little street  staring at the spect op  all this flummoxing the
smaller one so he keeps swinging the item stiffly this way and that way  trying to keep way more people at potential bay  the two
alien foreigners that want lenz s map bear down slowly across the montego s headlights toward where lenz is holding gately like
a shield  the larger one that s so large his luauish shirt won t even button all the way holding out the mustache adopts the overly
reasonable tone that always precedes a serious type beef  he reads gately s bowling shirt in the headlight and says reasonably that
moose still has a chance to keep out of what they ve got no beef with him  them  lenz is pouring a diarrheatic spatter of
disclaimers and exhortations into gately s right ear  gately shrugs at the nucks like he s got no choice but to be here  green s just
looking at them  it occurs to gately by white flag suggestion that who gives a fuck how it d look  he ought to hit his knees right
here on the headlit blacktop and ask for guidance on this from a higher power  but he stands there  lenz chattering in his shadow 
the fingernails of lenz s hand on gately s shoulder have horseshoes of dried blood in the creases between nail and finger  and
there s a coppery smell off lenz that isn t just fear  it occurs to gately that if he d pulled the instant spot urine he d wanted on lenz
this whole snafu wouldn t maybe be happening  the one nuck is holding lenz s disguise s mustache out at them like a blade  lenz
hasn t asked the time once  notice  then the other nuck s got his hand down at his side and a real blade s gleam appears in that
hand with the familiar snick  at the blade s sound the situation becomes even more automatic and gately feels adrenaline s
warmth spread through him as his subdural hardware clicks deeper into a worn familiar long past track  having no choice now not
to fight and things simplify radically  divisions collapse  gately s just one part of something bigger he can t control  his face in the
left headlight has dropped into its fight expression of ferocious good cheer  he says he s responsible for these people on these
private grounds tonight and is part of this whether he wants to be or not  and can they talk this out because he doesn t want to have
to fight them  he says twice very distinctly that he does not want to fight them  he s no longer divided enough to think about
whether this is true  his eyes are on the two men s maple leaf belt buckles  the part of the body where you can t get suckered by a
feint  the guys shake their manes and say they re going to unembowel this craven batard here like this sans christe batard killed
somebody they call either pepe or bebe  and if moose has any self interest he ll backpedal away from there s no way it is his duty
to get frapped or fropped for this sick gutless u s a  batard in his womanly wig  lenz  apparently thinking they re brazilian  pops
his head around gately s flank and calls them maricones and tells them they can suck his batard is what they can do  gately has
just division enough to almost wish he didn t feel such a glow of familiar warmth  a surge of almost sexual competence  as the two
shriek at lenz s taunts and split and curve in at them an arm s length apart  walking gradually faster  like unstoppable inertia  but
stupidly too close together  at two meters off they charge  shedding petals and unisonly bellowing something in canadian 
it s always that everything always speeds up and slows down both  gately s smile broadens as he s shoved slightly forward by
lenz as lenz recoils backward off him to run from the guys  shrieking charge  gately takes the shove s momentum and
bodychecks the enormous nuck holding the mustache into the nuck holding the blade  who goes down with an euf of expelled air 
the first nuck has hold of gately s bowling shirt and rips it and punches gately in the forehead and audibly breaks his hand 
letting go of gately to grab his hand  the punch makes gately stop thinking in any sort of spiritual terms at all  gately takes the
man s broken hand s arm he s holding out and with his eyes on the ground s other nuck breaks the arm over his knee  and as the
guy goes down on one knee gately takes the arm and pirouettes around twisting the broken arm behind the guy s back and plants
his sneaker on the guy s floral back and forces him forward so there s a sick crack and he feels the arm come out of the socket  and
there s a high foreign scream  the nuck with the blade who was down slashes gately s calf through his jeans as the guy rolls

 gracefully left and starts to rise  up on one knee  knife out front  a guy that knows his knives and can t be closed with while he s
got the blade up  gately feints and takes one giant step and gets all his weight into a rockette kick that lands high up under the
nuck s beard s chin and audibly breaks gately s big toe in the sneaker and sends the man curving out back into the dazzle of the
highbeams  and there s a metallic boom of him landing on the montego s hood and the click and skitter of the blade landing
somewhere on the street beyond the car  gately on one foot  holding his toe  and his slashed calf feels hot  his smile is broad but
impersonal  it s impossible  outside choreographed entertainment  to fight two guys together at once  they ll kill you  the trick to
fighting two is to make sure and put one down for long enough that he s out of the picture long enough to put the other guy down 
and this first larger one with the extreme arm trouble is clutching himself as he rolls  trying to rise  still perversely holding the
white mustache  you can tell this is a real beef because nobody s saying anything and the sounds from everybody else have
receded to the sounds stands  crowds make and gately hops over and uses the good foot to kick the nuck twice in the side of the
big head and then without a thought in his head moves down the guy and lines it up and drops to one knee with all his weight on
the guy s groin  resulting in an indescribable sound from the guy and a shout from j v d  overhead and a flat crack from the lawn
and gately s punched so hard in the shoulder he s spun around on one knee and almost goes over backwards and the shoulder goes
hotly numb  which tells gately he s gotten shot instead of punched in the shoulder  he never got shot before  shot in
sobriety in bold headline caps goes across his mind s eye like a slow train as he sees the third nuck with his cap pushed back
and nuck face contorted with cordite in his good stance with elbow back up drawing a second bead on don s big head from    s
lawn with the bore s lightless eye and a little pubic curl of smoke coming up from the vented muzzle  and gately can t move and
forgets to pray  and then the bore zagging up and away as it blooms orange as good old bruce green s got the nuck from behind
in a half nelson with his hand in the necklace of flowers and with the other hand is forcing the cocked elbow down and the item
skyward away from gately s head as it blooms with that flat crack of a vented muzzle  the first thing somebody s who s shot
wants to do is throw up  which by the way the larger nuck with the breezeblocked crotch under gately s doing all over his beard
and flower necklace and gately s leg s thigh as gately weaves on one knee on the guy s groin still  the lady yells for help  now a
meaty thwack as nell gunther on the lawn leaps several twirling meters and kicks the nuck green s half nelsoning in the face
with her paratrooper boot s heel  and the guy s hat flies off and his head snaps back and hits green s face  and there s the pop of
green s nose breaking but he doesn t let go  and the guy s slumped forward in the parkin sonian half bow of a guy in a quality
half nelson  with the guy s item hand s arm still up in the air with green s arm like they re dancing  and good old green doesn t
even let go to hold his spurting nose  and now that the nuck s restrained  notice  here comes lenz barrelling in howling from the
hedge s shadows and leaping and he tackles the nuck and green both  and they re a roil of clothes and legs on the lawn  the item
not in sight  ken erdedy still has his hands up  gately  still kneeling shot on the nuck s sickeningly softened groin  gately hears
the second nuck trying to slide himself off the hood of the montego and hops and wobbles over  joelle v d  keeps yelling
something monosyllabic from what can t be her window  don goes to the montego s front bumper and punches the large man
carefully in the kidneys with his good arm and takes him by the thick foreign hair and slides him back up the hood and begins
banging his head off the montego s windshield  he remembers how he d stay in luxury furnished north shore apts  with g 
fackelmann and t  kite and they d gradually strip the place and sell the appointments off until they were sleeping in a totally bare
apartment  green has risen bloody faced  and lenz is on the lawn with his heaving topcoat covering him and the third nuck  and
clenette h  and yolanda w  are now up and not at bay and circling them and getting solid high heel kicks into the nuck s and
sometimes hopefully lenz s ribs  reciting  motha fucka  and landing a kick each time they get to fu  gately  canted way over to the
side  methodically beats his nuck s shaggy head against the windshield so hard that spidered stars are appearing in the shatterproof
glass until something in the head gives with a sort of liquid crunch  petals from the guy s necklace are all over the hood and
gately s torn shirt  joelle v d  in her terry robe and gauze veil and still clutching a toothbrush has climbed out onto the little
balcony outside the   woman s window and into a skinny ailanthus beside it and is coming down  showing about two meters of
spectacularly undeformed thigh  shouting gately s name by the first name  which he likes  gately leaves the largest nuck prone on
the idling hood  his head resting in a shatter frosted head shaped recession in the windshield  it occurs to ken erdedy  looking up
into the oak past his upraised hands  that this deformed veiled girl likes don gately in an extracurricular way  it would seem 
gately  toe and shoulder or no  has looked strictly all business this whole time  he s projected a sort of white collar attitude of
cheery competence and sangfroid  erdedy s found he rather likes standing there with his hands up in a gesture of noncombatant
status while the afro american girls curse and kick and lenz continues to roll around with the unconscious man hitting him and
going  there  there   and gately moves backward between the second fellow in the windshield and the first fellow he d originally
disarmed  his smile now as empty as a pumpkin s grin  chandler foss is trying on the third fellow s plaid hunting cap  there s a
sound in    of somebody trying to force a warped window  an empire w d v  is launched with a kind of spronging thud and
whistles overhead  climbing  its warning light wrap of like xmas lights winking red and green as don gately starts to come over
in the direction of the lawn and the fellow who appears to have winged him and then veers drunkenly and changes direction and in
three one foot hops is over to the vomit covered first nuck  the one who d called gately moose and punched him in the forehead 
there s the slow trundle of the green t and exhortations from minty as gately begins stomping on the supine face of the nuck
with the heel of his good foot as if he were killing cockroaches  the guy s movable arm is waggling pathetically in the air around
gately s shoe as it rises and falls  gately s hideous torn orange shirt s whole right side is dark and his right arm drips blackly and
seems weirdly set in its socket  lenz is up and adjusting his wig and brushing off  the veiled girl has hit a rough part some three
meters up and is hanging from a limb and kicking  erdedy staring copernicanly up her flapping robe  the new tingley kid sits
cross legged in the grass and rocks as the black ladies continue stomping the inert nuck  you can hear emil minty and wade
mcdade exhorting yolanda w  to use the spike heel  charlotte treat is reciting the serenity prayer over and over  bruce green
has his head back and his finger held like a mustache under his nostrils  hester thrale can still be heard way off down warren
street  receding  as gately wobbles back from the nuck s map and sits heavily down in the little street  in shadow except for his
huge head in the nucks  car s lights  sitting there with his head on his knees  lenz and green move in toward him the cautious way
you approach a big animal that s hurt  joelle van dyne lands on her feet  the lady at the high warped window shouts for
helphelphelphelphelp  minty and mcdade come down off the back porch  finally  mcdade for some reason wielding a mop 
everybody except lenz and minty looks unwell 

 joelle runs just like a girl  erdedy notes        she gets out through the many angled cars into the street just as gately
decides to lie down 
it s not like passing out  it s just a decision gately makes to like lie back with his knees bent and pointing up into the sky s
depth  which seems to bulge and recede with the pulse in his right shoulder  which has now gone dead cold  which means there
will very soon be pain  he predicts 
he waves off concern with the left hand and goes  flesh wound  the second joelle s bare feet and robe s hem are in view 
 son of a fucking bitch  
 flesh wound  
 are you ever bleeding  
 thanks for the feedback  
you can hear henderson and willis off in the background still going  fu  
 i think you can tell them he s probably subdued   gately pointing off in what he thinks is    s lawn s direction  his lying flat
gives him a double chin  he can feel  and pulls his big face into a smile  his big present fear is throwing up in front of and maybe
partly on joelle v d   whose calves he s noted 
now lenz s lizard skin loafers with grass stains at the toes   don what can i say  
gately struggles to sit back up   you got fucking armed nucks wanting your ass too  
revealing a kind of blackly kimonoish thing under  joelle has taken off the terry robe and folds the robe into a kind of
trapezoidal pad and is kneeling over gately s shoulder  straddling his arm  pressing down on the pad with the heels of her hands 
 owie  
 lenz he s really bleeding bad here  
 i m groping to even know what to begin to say  don  
 you owe me urine  lenz  
 i think there s two of them  like  desisted   wade mcd  s unlaced high tops  his voice breathy with awe 
 he s bleeding really bad i said  
 you mean deceased  
 there s one of their shoes in one of them s fucking eye  
 tell ken to put his hands down for christ s sake  
 oh fucking god  
gately can feel his eyes crossing and uncrossing by themselves 
 he soaking right through it man look at that shit  
 this man needs an ambulance  
somebody else female says god again and gately s hearing warbles a bit as joelle snaps at her to shut up  she leans down and
in  so gately can see up at what looks like a regular human female chin and makeupless lower lip under the veil s billowing hem 
 whom should we call   she asks him 
 call pat s machine and calvin  you have to dial    tell them to come down  
 i m going to be sick  
 airdaddy   minty is shouting at ken e 
 tell her to call annie and the e m  office down there and do some like strategic thing  
 where the fuck is security when it isn t just innocent recovering cars to get towed  
 and call pat   gately says 
a forest of footwear and bare feet and shins all around him  and heads too high to see  lenz screaming back to somebody in
the house   call a fucking ambulance already  
 regulate the voice  man  
 fucking call about five ambulances is more like it  
 mothafucka  
 ssshh  
 i just never saw anything like that  
 nuh uh   gately gasps  trying to rise and deciding he just likes it better lying down   don t call one for me  
 this is the straight and narrow  
 by doze is fide  
 he doesn t want one he said  
green s and minty s boots  treat s purple plastic shower thongs  somebody has on clearasil  he can smell 
 seen some righteous ass kickings in my past  brother  but   
somebody male screams back off to the right 
 just don t try and walk me around   gately grins up 
 dipshit  
 he can t go in no e r  with a gunshot   minty says to lenz  whose shoes keep moving to get himself north of everybody 
 somebody turn off the car will you  
 i wouldn t touch nothing  
gately focuses at where the joelle girl s eyes would be  her thighs are forked way wide to straddle his arm  which is numb
and doesn t feel like his  she s bearing down on him  she smells strange but good  she s got all her weight on her bathrobe s pad 
she weighs roughly nothing  the first threads of pain are starting to radiate out of the shoulder and down the side and into the
neck  gately hasn t looked down at the shoulder  on purpose  and he tries to wedge his left hand s finger under the shoulder to see
if anything went through  the night s so clear the stars shine right through people s heads 
 green  
tb dot touchig dothig  dud worry  

  look at his bead   
her kimono s shoulders are humped and glassy black in the montego s light  gately s brain keeps wanting to go away inside
himself  when you start to feel deeply cold that s shock and blood loss  gately sort of wills himself to stay right here  looks over
past joelle s hand at lenz s fine shoes   lenz  you and green  get me inside  
 green  
the circle of stars  heads  faces above are all faceless from the headlights  shadows  some car engines have shut off and some
haven t  one of the cars has a twittering fan belt  somebody s suggesting to call the genuine finest   erdedy   which everybody
greets with scorn at his naivete  gately s figuring staff from the shed or    has called them or at least dialed down to security  by
the time he was ten only his pinkie finger would fit in the dialer s holes of his mother s old princess phone  he exerts will to uncross his eyes and stay right here  he in the worst way does not want to be lying here with a gunshot in shock trying to deal with
the finest 
 i think one of these guys is  like  expired  
 no shit shylock  
 nobody call   gately yells it up and out  he s afraid he s going to vomit when they stand him up   nobody call nobody til you
get me in   he can smell green s leather jacket overhead  bits of grass and whatnot drifting down onto him from where lenz is
still brushing off his clothes  and coins of blood on the street from green s nose  joelle tells lenz if he doesn t cut something out
she s going to hand him his ass  gately s whole right side had gone deadly cold  to joelle he says   i m supervised  i ll go to jail
sure  
 you got fucking eyewitnesses out the ass behind you don man   either mcdade or glynn says  but it can t be glynn  for some
reason he tries to bring up inside him  and it seems like charlotte t  s voice saying ewell s trying to get in pat s office to call but
gately locked pat s door 
 nobody call anyone   joelle shouts up and out  she smells good 
 they re calling  
 get him off the phone  say prank for christ s sake  you hear me   her kimono smells good  her voice has a staff like
authority  the scene out here has changed  gately s down  madame psychosis is in charge 
 we re going to get him up and we re going to get him inside   she says to the circle   lenz  
there s impending static crackle and the sound of a serious set of keys 
her voice is that one madame lady s voice on no subscription radio  from out of nowhere he s all of a sudden sure  is where
he heard that odd empty half accented voice before 
 secyotty  hold it right thaah   it s at least luckily one of the ex football e m  security guys  that spends half his shift down at
the life and then goes up and down the streetlet all night playing with his service baton and singing sea chanties off key  that s
just impressively qualified to come in to aa with them 
joelle   erdedy   deal with him  
 pardon me  
 it s the drunk   gately gets out 
joelle s looking up at presumably ken e   go over and look high income and respectable at him  verbalize at him  distract
him while we get him inside before the real ones come  
 how am i supposed to explain all these prone figures draped over cars  
 for christ s sake ken he s not a mental titan   distract him with something shiny or something  get your thumb out of your
ass and move  
gately s smile has reached his eyes   you re madame on the fm  is how i knew you  
erdedy s squeaky shoe and the obese guy s radio and keys   who hold it  as in desist  
 secyotty i said halt  
green and lenz bending in  white breath all over and green s dripping nose the same copper smell as lenz 
 i knew i knew you   gately says to joelle  whose veil remains inscrutable 
 if i could ask you to specify halt from what  
 get his back up here first   green tells lenz 
 not crazy about all this blood   lenz is saying 
many hands slide under his back  the shoulder blooms with colorless fire  the sky looks so   d you could like dive in  the
stars distend and sprout spikes  joelle s warm legs shift with her weight to keep pressure on the pad  the squishing sound gately
knows means the robe s soaked through  he wants somebody to congratulate him for not having thrown up  you can tell some of
the stars are nearer and some far  down there  what gately s always thought of as the big question mark is really the big dipper 
 i m oddering desist until who s in change that i can repot the sichation   the security guy s hammered  his name s sidney or
stanley and he wears his security hat and baton shopping in the purity supreme and always asks gately how it s hanging  his
shoes  uppers are blasted along the feet s in sides the way fat men that have to walk a lot s are  his ex ballplayer s col lops and big
hanging gut are one of gately s great motivators for nightly situps  gately turns his head to throw up a little on both green and
joelle  who both ignore it 
 oh sorry  oh shit i hate that  
joelle v d  runs a hand down gately s wet arm that leaves a warm wake  the hand  and then gently squeezes as much of the
wrist as she can get her hand around   and lo   she says softly 
 jesus his leg s all bloody too  
 boy do i know guys loved that show you did   a tiny bit more throwing up 
 now we re going to lift him very gently and get the feet under  
 here green man get over here on the south why don t you

saying this is bad is like saying traffic is bad  or health care surtaxes  or the hazards of annular fusion  nobody but ludditic
granola crunching freaks would call bad what no one can imagine being without 
but so very much private watching of customized screens behind drawn curtains in the dreamy familiarity of home  a
floating no space world of personal spectation  whole new millennial era  under gentle and lace forche  total freedom  privacy 
choice 
hence the new millennium s passion for standing live witness to things  a whole sub rosa schedule of public spectation
opportunities   spect ops   the priceless chance to be part of a live crowd  watching  thus the gapers  blocks at traffic accidents 
sewer gas explosions  muggings  purse snatchings  the occasional empire w d v  with an incomplete vector splat ting into north

one top back bay public spect op every november is watching expressionless men in federal white and municipal cadet blue
drain and scrub the public gardens  man made duck pond for the upcoming winter  they drain it sometime in november every
year  it s publicly unannounced  there s no fixed schedule  long shiny trucks just all of a sudden appear in a ring at pond s rim  it s
always a weekday c  mid november  it s also always somehow a gray raw sad windy boston day  gulls cartwheeling in a sky the
color of dirty glass  people mufflered and with new gloves on  not your ideal sylvan type day for conventional lounging or public
spectation  but a massive crowd always collects and thickens in a dense ring along the banks of the public gardens  pond  the
pond has ducks  the pond is perfectly round  its surface roughened to elephant skin by the wind  geometrically round and banked
with lawn quality grass and shrubbery in even spaced clumps  with park type benches between the shrubs overhung by whitebarked willows who ve now wept their yellow autumn grit onto the green benches and grass banks where an arc of crowd now
forms and thickens  watching duly designated authorities commence to drain the pond  some of the pond s flightier ducks have
already decamped for points south  and more leave on some phylogenic cue just as the shiny trucks pull up  but the main herd
remains  two private planes fly in lazy ellipses just under the cloud cover overhead  banners strung out behind them advertising
four different levels of comfort and protection from depend  the wind keeps blowing the banners sideways  mobiusizing them
and then straightening them back out with the loud pop of flags unfurling  from the ground the engines and banners  pops are too
faint to hear above the crowd noise and ducks and wind s mean whistle  the swirling groundwind s so bad that u s  chief of
unspecified services rodney tine  standing with his hands at the small of his back at a window on the eighth floor of the state
house annex on beacon and joy sts   looking southwest and down at the concentric rings of pond and crowd and trucks  can see
wind driven leaves and street grit swirling right outside and pecking at this very window he stands before  massaging his coccyx 
dr  james o  incandenza  filmmaker and almost a scopophile about spect ops and crowds  never once missed this spectacle 
when alive and in town  hal and mario have both been to a few  so have several ennet residents  though some of them weren t in
much of a position to remember  it seems as if everyone in metro boston s seen at least one pond draining  it s always the same
sort of grim windy northeast november day where if you were at home you d be eating earth tone soups in a warm kitchen 
listening to the wind and glad of home and hearth  every year himself came was the same  the deciduous trees were always

 skeletal  the pines palsied  the willows wind whipped and nubbly  the grass dun and crunchy underfoot  the water rats always
seeing the big drainage picture first and gliding like night to the cement sides to flee  always a crowd in thickening rings  always
rollerblades on the gardens  paths  lovers joined at the hand  frisbee in the distance on the rim of the gardens  other side s
hillside s slope  which faces away from the pond 
u s  office of unspecified services chief rodney tine stands at the unclean window for much of the morning  ruminative 
his posture a martial at ease  a stenographer and an aide and a deputy mayor and the director of the massachusetts division for
substance abuse services  and unspecified services regional operatives rodney tine jr        and hugh steeply       all sit
silently in the conference room behind him  the stenographer s gregg pen poised in mid dictation  the eighth floor window s
purview goes all the way to the ridge of the hillside at the gardens  other end  two frisbees and what looks like a disembowelled
ring of frisbee float back and forth along this ridge  dreamily floating back and forth  sometimes dipping below the ridge and lost 
for a moment  to the specular vision of tine 
trying at the same time to give his bad skin some quality uv and a good chill s chap  the grad work study engineer of
m i t  s wyyy     lies bare chested on a silvery nasa souvenir space blanket  supine and cruciform at about the angle of a
living room recliner on the public gardens  far hillside  this is out by arlington st   in the gardens  southwest corner  hidden by
its ridge from the pond s basin and tourism booth and pavilion and the hub of radial paths and the giant verdigrised statues of
ducklings in a row commemorating robert mccloskey s beloved and timeless make way for ducklings  the gardens  only other
slope is now the bowl of the former pond  the hillside s grassy decline  not too steep  runs at a wedge s angle down toward
arlington st  and is one broad greensward  free of dog droppings because dogs won t go to the bathroom on inclined terrain 
frisbees float on the ridge behind the engineer s head  and four lithe boys on the ridge play a game with a small beanbaggy ball
and bare blue feet  it is    c  the sun has the attenuated autumn quality of seeming to be behind several panes of glass  the wind
is bitter and keeps flopping unmoored sections of nasa blanket over parts of the engineer s body  goose pimples and real
pimples jostle each other for space on his exposed flesh  the student engineer s is the hillside s only metallic space blanket and
bare torso  he lies there splayed  wholly open to the weak sun  the wyyy student engineer is one of roughly three dozen human
forms scattered over the steep slope  a human collection without pattern or cohesion or anything to bind them  looking rather like
firewood before it s been gathered  wind bronzed sooty men in zipperless parkas and mismatched shoes  some of the gardens 
permanent residents  sleeping or in stupors of various origin  curled on their sides  knees drawn up  unopen to anything  in other
words huddled  from the great height of one of arlington st  s office buildings  the forms look like things dumped onto the
hillside from a great height  an overhead veteran d be apt to see a post battle battlefield aspect to the array of forms  except for
the wyyy engineer  all the men are textured in urban scuz  unshaven  yellow fingered and exposure bronzed  they have coats
and bedrolls for blankets and old twine handle shopping bags and glad bags for recyclable cans and bottles  also huge camper s
packs without any color to them  their clothes and appurtenances are the same color as the men  in other words  a few have steel
supermarket carts filled with possessions and wedged by their owners  bodies against a downhill roll  one of the cart owners has
vomited in his sleep  and the vomit has assumed a lava like course toward the huddled form of another man curled just downhill 
one of the shopping carts  from upscale bread   circus  has an ingeniously convenient little calculator on its handlebar  designed
to let shoppers subtotal their groceries as they select them  the men have sepia nails and all somehow look toothless whether they
have teeth or not  every so often a frisbee lands among them  the loose ball makes a beanbaggy sound against players  feet above
and behind them  two skinny and knit capped boys descend very close to the engineer  chanting very softly  smoke   ignoring all
the other forms  which anyone could tell are undercapitalized for purchasing smoke  when his eyes are open he s the only one on
the hillside to see the round bellies of ascending ducks pass low overhead  catching a thermal off the hillside and rising to wheel
away left  due south  his wyyy     t shirt and inhaler and glasses and m  fizzy and spine split copy of metallurgy of annular
isotopes are just off the edge of the reflecting blanket  his torso is pale and ribby  his chest covered with tough little buttons of
acne scar  the hillside s grass is still pretty viable  one or two of the scattered fetal forms have black cans of burnt out sterno
beside them  bits of the hillside are reflected in arlington s storefronts and office windows and the glass of passing cars  an
unexceptional white dodge or chevy type van pulls out of arlington s traffic and does some pretty impressive parallel parking
along the curb at the hillside s bottom  a man in an ancient nato surplus wool greatcoat is up on his hands and knees to the
engineer s lower left  throwing up  bits of chyme hang from his mouth and refuse to detach  there s little bloody threads in it  his
hunched form looks somehow canine on the uneven slope  the fetal figure wedged unconscious under the front wheels of the
shopping cart nearest the engineer has only one shoe  and that shoe s without laces  the exposed sock is ash colored  besides the
handicapped license plate  the only exceptional things about the van now idling at the curb far below are the tinted windows and
the fact that the van is spotless and twinkly with wax to about halfway up its panelled side  but above that line dirty and rustsaucered and shamefully neglected looking  the engineer has been turning his head this way and that  trying to tan evenly along
his whole jawline  the curbside van idles at a distant little point between his heels  some of the hillside s forms have curled
themselves around bottles and pipes  a smell comes off them  rich and agricultural  the student engineer doesn t usually try to sun
and chap his skin at the same time  but chapping ops have lately been scarce  since madame psychosis of         took her sudden
leave of medical absence  the student engineer hasn t once had the heart to sit out on the union s convoluted roof and monitor the
substitute shows 
the engineer moves his upturned face back and forth  first  madame was replaced by a mass comm  graduate student who
proved a crushing disappointment as a miss diagnosis  then madame was publicly deemed irreplaceable by management  and the
engineer is now paid simply to cue her background music and then sit monitoring a live mike for a noiseless    minutes  which
means he has to stay in his booth maintaining   levels with a live mike and can t ascend with his receiver and cigarettes even if he
wanted to  the station s student manager s given the engineer written instructions on just what to say when people phone in during
the hour to inquire and wish psychosis a speedy recovery from whatever might ail her  at once denying and encouraging rumors
of suicide  institutionalization  spiritual crisis  silent retreat  pilgrimage to the snow capped east  the disappearance of someone
who s been only a voice is somehow worse instead of better  a terrible silence now  weeknights  a different silence altogether
from the radio silence type silence that used to take up over half her nightly show  silence of presence v  silence of absence 
maybe  the silences on the tapes are the worst  some listeners have actually come in and down through the deep cortex and into

 the cold pink studio itself  to inquire  some to allay this firm conviction that madame was still actually still showing up and sitting
there by the mike but not saying anything  another of the men sleeping nearby keeps punching at the air in his sleep  almost all
the personal wee hour inquiries are from listeners somehow bent  misshapen  speech defective  vacantly grinning  damaged in
some way  the type whose spectacles have been repaired with electrician s tape  shyly inquiring  apologies for bothering
someone they can clearly see is not even there  before the student manager s written instructions  the student engineer d
wordlessly directed their attention to madame s triptych screen with no silhouette behind it  another white dodge van  just as
unevenly clean and opaque windowed  has appeared on the ridge above and behind the hillside s littered forms  it casts no visible
shadow  a frisbee ring caroms off the clean grille of its snout  it idles  its panel door facing the declivity and the other white van s
panel door far below  one hideous little inquirer had had a hat with a lens on it and seemed about to fall forward into the
engineer s lap  his attendant wanting some address where they might send something supportive and floral  the nasa blanket s
micronized aluminumoid coating is designed to refract every possible uv ray into the student engineer s bare skin  the engineer
knows about the ambulance and the brigham and women s icu and five day rehab ward from the thick swart girl notkin  the one
with the disreputable hat and film dept  i d  who came down via the basilar elevator late at night to retrieve some old tapes of
the program for the madame s personal listening use  she said  and was fortunate enough to know the madame in private life  she
said  the term is treatment  madame psychosis is in long term treatment at something the bearded girl in the sooty hat obliquely
described as only half a house in some unbelievably unpleasant and low rent part of the metro area  this is the precise total of
what the wyyy engineer knows  he is shortly to have occasion to wish he knew a great deal more  q v  the dimpled steel ramp
now protruding from the squeakily opened panel door of the van on the ridge above and behind him  q v  the utter darkness inside
the idling van down along the arlington st  curb  whose side panel s also been slid open from within  the southwest hillside is
copless  the gardens  platoon of m d c  finest are all in their souped up golf carts over at the drained pond  throwing curved
sections of glazed doughnut into the ducks  shrubbery and telling a largely dispersed already crowd to please move along  the
ridge s frisbees and hackysackers have abruptly vanished  there s now an eerie stillness like a reef when a shark cruises through 
the ridge s van s idling maw open and black  silver tongued 
q v  also the wheelchair that now all of a sudden shoots down the hillside s van s ramp as a madly squeaking brass colored
blur  a snowplow like scoop type thing welded to it and out front skimming the ground and throwing off chaff from the swath of
grass it s mowing  moving terrifically fast  brakes unapplied  the legless figure up on burly stumps in the chair fleur de lis withsword stem masked and bent far forward for a skier s pure speed  the huddled fetal hillside figures the speeding chair slaloms  the
dim glittered movements of arrangement for reception deep within the curbside van way at the bottom of the steep grade  the
engineer arching his neck way out to capture sun on the scarred hollows under his jaw  the shopping cart with the calculator
clipped by a squeaking rubberized wheel at an angle and sent clattering off down the hillside  spraying possessions  the homeless
shoe to which it had been roped skittering empty behind it and the cart s now shoeless unconscious owner just waving at the air in
front of his face in sleep as if at a bad d t  dream of lost shoe and worldly goods  the calculating cart whumping into the side of
the hunched man vomiting and flipping over and bouncing several times and the vomiting man rolling and yelping  vulgarities
echoing  the wyyy engineer now to be seen hiking himself up on a chill reddened elbow with a start and starting to turn and
look above and behind him up at the ridge just as the speeding wheelchair with the hunched figure reaches him and the chair s
shovel scoops the engineer and his nasa blanket and shirt and book up and runs over the glasses and bottle of m  fizzy with one
wheel and bears the engineer in the scoop up and away and down the steep grade toward the idling van at the bottom  a van whose
own angled ramp now slides out like a tongue or autoteller s transaction receipt  the nasa blanket blowing away from the
scooped engineer s flailing form about halfway down and suddenly aloft in a hillside thermal and blown far out over arlington st 
traffic by the keen november wind  the madly squeaking wheelchair aloft over hillside moguls and coming back down and up
again  the snatched engineer in the chair s scoop appearing to the hillside s roused figures mostly as a hallucinatory waggle of bare
limbs and strangely wheezy shrieks for help or at least to look out below  all as the modified chair squeaks frantically straight
down the hillside s most efficient downward line toward the van with the ramp now idling in gear  its pipe s exhaust beating the
street in high rpm idle  the nasa blanket twisting co ruscant in the air high above the street  and the shriek roused figures on the
hillside lying there still bent in and barely moving  stiff with cold and general woe  except for the hunched man  the unwell man
who d been hit by the dislodged cart  who s rolled to a stop and is thrashing  holding the parts that were hit

line and salad bar  and lots of younger kids keep looking to the best table and stice  sixteen  crew cutted and still in his black fila

 sweats with no shirt under the unzipped top  assembling a complex sandwich on his plate  and they let their eyes widen and
postures sag to communicate awe  r h i p 
stice  oblivious  bites into his sandwich like it s the wrist of an assailant  the only sound at the table for the first few minutes
is of forkwork and mastication and the slight gasping sounds of people trying to breathe while they eat  you rarely speak for the
first few minutes here  eating  supper is deadly serious  some of the kids even start in on their trays while still in line at the milk
dispenser  now coyle bites in  wayne has made his entree into a sandwich and lowers and bites  keith freer s eyes are half closed
as his jaw muscles bulge and slacken  some of the players  inclined heads are hard to see over the height of their food  struck and
schacht  side by side  bite in sync and chew  the only one at the table not eating like a refugee is trevor axford  who as a small
child back in short beach ct once fell off his bike onto his head and received a tiny lesion type brain injury after which all food
everywhere tastes horrible to him  his clearest explanation of the way food tastes to him is that it tastes the way vomit smells  he s
discouraged from speaking at meals and holds his nose while he eats and eats with the neutral joyless expression of somebody
dispensing fuel into his car  hal incandenza dismantles the stelliform mold shape e t a  mashed potatoes come in  mixing babyboileds in with the mashed  petropolis kahn and eliot kornspan eat with such horrible p o w ish gusto that nobody else will sit
with them   they re by themselves at a small table behind schacht and struck  utensils glittering amid a kind of fine mist or
spray  jim troeltsch keeps holding a clear tumbler of milk up to the ceiling s full spectrum lights and swirling the milk around in
the light  looking at it  pemulis chews with his mouth open  producing moist noises  a habit so family of origin ingrained no
amount of peer pressure can break him of it 
eventually the darkness clears his throat to speak  in the showers he d gotten up to the middle of an xmas story about one of
his parents  epic rows  his parents had met and fallen in love in a country western bar in partridge ks   just outside liberal ks
on the oklahoma border   met and fallen in star crossed love in a bar playing this popular kansas c w bar game where they put
their bare forearms together and laid a lit cigarette in the little valley between the two forearms  flesh and kept it there till one of
them finally jerked their arm away and reeled away holding their arm  mr  and mrs  stice each discovered somebody else that
wouldn t jerk away and reel away  stice explained  their forearms were still to this day covered with little white slugs of burnscar  they d toppled like pines for each other from the git go  stice explained  they d been divorced and remarried four or five
times  depending on how you defined certain juris prudential precepts  when they were on good domestic terms they stayed in
their bedroom for days of squeaking springs with the door locked except for brief sallies out for beefeater gin and chinese takeout in little white cardboard pails with wire handles  with the stice children wandering ghostlike through the clapboard house in
sagging diapers or woolen underwear subsisting on potato chips out of econobags bigger than most of them were  the stice kids 
the kids did somewhat physically better during periods of nuptial strife  when a stony faced mr  stice slammed the kitchen door
and went off daily to sell crop insurance while mrs  stice   whom both mr 
stice and the darkness called  the bride    while the bride spent all day and evening cooking intricate multicourse meals
she d feed bits of to the brood  stice refers to both himself and his six siblings as  the brood   and then keep warm in quietly
rattling lidded pots and then hurl at the kitchen walls when mr  stice came home smelling of gin and of cigarette brands and
toilet eau not the bride s own  ortho stice loves his folks to distraction  but not blindly  and every holiday home to partridge ks
he memorizes highlights of their connubial battles so he can regale the e t a  upperclass men with them  mostly at meals  after
the initial forkwork and gasping have died down and people have returned to sufficient levels of blood sugar and awareness of
their surroundings to be regaled  some of them listen  drifting in and out  troeltsch and pemulis are arguing about whether
e t a  s kitchen staff has started trying to slip them powdered milk on the sly  freer and wayne are still hunched and chewing 
very intent  hal s making some sort of structure out of his food  struck keeps both elbows on the table at all times and utensils in
his clenched fists like a parody of a man eating  pemulis always listens to stice s tales  often repeating little phrases  shaking his
head in admiration 
 i m just going to go up and refuse to eat one more thing with a utensil that s gone down the disposal   schacht is holding up a
fork with crazy tines   just look at it  who could eat with something like that  
 the old man is a son of a bitch that is cool under fire  in terms of the bride   stice says  leaning in to bite and chew  the
tendency at e t a  is to take the entree and unless it s a wet entree to take wheat bread and make it a sandwich  for the extra carbs 
it s like pemulis can t really taste his food unless he mashes it against his palate  the academy s wheat bread is bicycled in by
guys in birkenstock sandals from bread   circus quality provisions in cambridge  because it s got to be not only sugarless but
low in glutens  which tavis and schtitt believe promote torpor and excess mucus  axford  who lost to tall paul shaw in straight
sets and if he loses to him again tomorrow goes down to    a  stares stonily into space  his motions less like somebody eating
than like somebody miming eating  hal s made an intricate fortification structure of his food  complete with turrets and archerslits  and even though he s not much eating or drinking his six cranberry juices he keeps swallowing a lot  studying his structure 
as the eating slows down at the best table the more observant of them give hal and ax ford tiny sideways looks  the players 
different cpus humming through decision trees on whether a still publicly undiscussed but much rumored showdown with dr 
tavis and the o n a n t a  urology guy  plus now this loss to shaw and near loss to ortho stice  might not have shaken inc and
axhandle along some psychic competitive fault line  different guys with different rankings calculating the permuted advantages to
themselves of hal and axford having a deeply distracted and anxious week  though michael pemulis  the other rumored
o n a n t a  urine scannee  ignores axford s expression and hal s excessive swallowing altogether  though possibly studiously
ignoring them  staring meditatively at the squeegees       taken down off the wall and leaning against the unlit fireplace  fingers
steepled before his lips  hearing out troeltsch  who blows his nose with one hand and rattles his tumbler of half drunk milk on the
tabletop with the other 
pemulis shakes his head very seriously at troeltsch   not a chance  brother  
 i m telling you man this milk is powdered   troeltsch peering down into the tumbler  probing the milk s surface with a thick
finger   me i can tell from powdered  i have growing up domestic confirmed traumas around powdered  the day mother
announced milk was too heavy to keep lugging back from the store and switched to powdered  with father s ok  father knuckling
under like roosevelt at yalta  my big sister ran away from home  and the rest of us were traumatized around it  this switch to
powdered  which is unmistakable if you know what to look for  

 freer makes a snoring noise 
 and do i ever know what to look for  to verify   troeltsch is hoarse  and one of these people who speaks to more than one
person at once by looking from one person to one person to one person  he s not a born public speaker   namely your telltale
residues along the sides of the glass  when swished   w  great flourished swishings of the milk 
 except troeltsch you can turn around and see them fucking loading the bags into the dispenser every twenty minutes  bags
of milk  that say milk on them  the bags  liquid  sloshy  hard to handle  it s milk  
 you see bags  you see the word milk  they re counting on the packaging  image management  sensory management  
responding to pemulis but looking at struck   part of some larger overall kertwang  possible punishment for the eschaton thing  
eyes going briefly to hal   covert vitamins possibly next  let s not even mention saltpeter  put aside deductions from bags a
second  i m sticking to facts  fact  this is verifiably powdered milk  
 you re saying they mix powdered milk and then try and pour it into milk bags  all to allay  
schacht clears his mouth and swallows mightily   tavis can t even regrout tile in the locker room without calling a
community meeting or appointing a committee  the regrouting committee s been dragging along since may  suddenly they re
pulling secret       milk switches   it doesn t ring true  jim  
 and troeltsch has a cold  he said   freer observes  indicating the little bottle of seldane next to troeltsch s squeezing ball  by
his plate   you can t even taste  troeltsch  if you got a real cold  
 trevor should have the cold  axhandle  no   schacht says  tapping carminative capsules onto his palm from his own amber
bottle 
with supper they can choose milk or else cranberry juice  that most carbcaloric of juices  which froths redly in its own clear
dispenser by the salad bar  the milk dispenser stands alone against the west wall  a big huge    liter three bagger  the milk
inserted in ovaloid mammarial bags into its refrigerated cabinet of brushed steel  with three receptacles for tumblers and three
levers for controlled dispensing  there s two levers for skim and one for supposedly high lecithin chocolate skim  which every
new e t a  tries exactly once and discovers tastes like skim with a brown crayon melted into it  there s a sign in a kitchenstaffer s crude black block caps taped to the dispenser s facade that says milk is filling  drink what you take  the
sign used to say milk is filling  drink what you take until the comma was semicolonized by the insertion of a blue
dot by a fairly obvious person        the line for seconds on entrees now stretches out past the milk dispenser  the best thing
about satiation and slowing down on the eating is leaning back and feeling autolysis start in on what you ate and tending to your
teeth while you gaze around the airy room at crowds and clumps of kids  observing behaviors and pathologies with a clear and
sated head  the littler kids running in tight circles trying to follow the shadow of the ceiling fan  girls laughing crumpled against
their seatmates  shoulders  people protecting their plates  the blurred sexuality and indecisive postures of puberty  two marginal
male    s have their heads directly in the bowls in the salad bar  and some of the surrounding females are commenting  different
kids are illustrating points with different gestures  john wayne and keith freer stroll purposefully through the serpentine crowd
and up to the front of the seconds line and insert themselves in front of a little boy who s tearing at a held bagel with great violent
movements of head and neck  the    a s get free buttinskis  r h i  literal p   at e t a  jim struck spears one of the cherry
tomatoes out of hal s salad bowl with a savage fork gesture  hal makes no comment 
troeltsch has run his thick finger around the inside of the tumbler and is holding the digit out at different guys around the
table   note a certain bluish cast to it  traces and remains  suspicious foam  minute grains of not quite altogether dissolved
particulate powdered stuff  powdered always leaves its telltale signs  
 your fucking head is a minute grain  troeltsch  
 put that finger away  
 tryna eat here  
 paranoia   pemulis says  scooping up stray peas with the flat of his knife 
 base tuition of        scooters  not counting   troeltsch says  moving the finger back and forth in the air   the stuff drying
on the finger does not  admittedly  exactly look appetite whetting    and yet let s note how the lung s not up in spite of rampant
weather and achilles  complaints  and today s lunch a total deja vu of yesterday s lunch  and the bread and bagels they ve started
getting us day old with the yellow stickers on the bags  and there s dinette sets in the tunnels and acoustic tiles in the halls and
lawn mowers in the kitchen and tripods in the grass and squeegees on the wall and stice s bed moves around  and there s a ball
machine in the girls  lockers  longley reports  that for this kind of tuition none of this stuff the staff can get around to cleaning up
bef  
stice s head has jerked up  a trace of mashed potato on his nose   who says my bed moves  how s it you know anything about
any beds moving  
but it s true  the husky vi tripod of mario s near fatal encounter with the u s s  millicent kent was only the beginning 
starting with the mysterious and continuing fall of acoustic ceiling tiles from their places in the subdorms  drop ceilings 
inanimate objects have either been moved into or just out of nowhere appearing in wildly inappropriate places around e t a  for
the past couple months in a steadily accelerating and troubling cycle  last week a grounds crew lawnmower sitting clean and
silent and somehow menacing in the middle of the dawn kitchen gave mrs  clarke the fantods and resulted in eggplant parmesan
for two suppers in a row  which sent shock waves  yesterday a m  there d been a cannonesque ball machine   no small feat to
move around anywhere or get through doors   in the females  sauna  which machine some of the upperclass girls had found and
screamed at when they went in for the dawn saunas that help alleviate some vague female type problem that none of the guys
quite fathom  and two black girls on the breakfast crew reportedly found a set of squeegees on the dining hall s north wall  several
meters up and hung crossed in a kind of saltire  placed there by parties unknown  f  d  v  harde s a m  groundsmen reportedly
took the things down  and now they re leaning by the fireplace  the inappropriate found objects have had a tektitic and sinister
aspect  none of the cheery odor of regular pranksterism  they re not funny  to varying degrees they ve given everyone the fantods 
mrs  clarke had taken the morning off again  was why the repeat lunch  stice s eyes are back on his plate  which is nearly clean 
unmentioned is the fact that schacht and tall paul shaw at lunch went over the whole part of the north wall the black girls said
they found the squeegees on and could find neither nails nor holes from nails  as in no visible means of attachment  the whole

 thing s been studiously not talked about  adding to everybody s discomfort at troeltsch s hoarse complaints about tuition  which
vary in specifics but are otherwise routine 
 and then now the ultimate dietary cluster fuck  attempted powdered milk  
 trying to foist it you re saying  
 i m saying and look at us and what do we do  
 fake a cold and stay in bed playing sportscaster with the tp  in protest   says pemulis 
troeltsch uses the bottle of seldane to point for emphasis   we don t want to hear about it  we look the other way with our
heads in the sand  
 sounds fucking painful  
 go find some fucking synonyms for beat  
slice swallows hugely   never open your eyes underground  my old man s dictum  
 and so we distract ourselves   troeltsch says   we yuck it up  
pemulis makes a k sound   here s the real question  how dumb is troeltsch  
 troeltsch s so dumb he thinks a manila folder s a filipino contortionist  
 troeltsch  who s buried in grant s tomb  
kyle coyle says surely they ve all heard the one about what do canadian girls put behind their ears to attract boys  john
wayne gives him not a look  wayne s peering inside his own tumbler  where there does seem to be some sort of residue  there are
fragments of lettuce in his eyelashes  ortho stice s cheeks are ballooned with food  his eyes on his own salad s remains  expression
abstract and furrowed  a terrible kind of community energy in the whole dining hall  a kind of anxious sound carpet under the
surf of voices and the tinkle of flatware  and the darkness is at some vague center of this energy  somehow  you can feel  neither
wayne nor hal s been approachable all fall  on court  kids at other tables say low toned things to their seatmates  and then the
seatmate looks covertly over at stice s table  forehead purply crumpled  slice stares hard at his salad and tries to block input from
his phenomenal peripheral vision  two    s are contending over toast  petropolis kahn is preparing to catapult a chickpea at
somebody  jim struck points out bridgette boone and the u s s  millicent kent returning for what struck counts as fourths  and
stice blocks the sight out  the sad pretty sunset out over the hilltops of newton cannot be seen because the room s big windows
face east  out over the hillside and the enfield marine complex that the academy has bathed in shadow  so e m  s porch lights are
already on  and tall cubist bits of the old metropolis beyond that  east  with shadows encroaching  the afternoon just past was a
glory  scrubbed and cool and windless  cloud free  the sun a disk  the sky a dome  soaked in light  even the northern horizons bellclear against a faint green yellow cast  schacht has about eight amber bottles of various medicines for his crohn s disease  and a
whole ritual of administration  a couple of the black girls who work kitchen and custodial day shifts can be seen against the
shadowy tree line  making their way down the steep hillside s unauthorized path back down to the halfway house thing for
wretched people who come up here to work short time  the girls  bright cheap jackets are vivid in the shadow and trees  tangle 
the girls are having to hold hands against the grade  walking sideways and digging heavily in at each step  the black girl clenette
hal had read fear in as she left c t  s office with his litter now has a bulging backpack on her back  as in bulging maybe with
dumpster pilferage        her arms strung way out between the other black girl didi and the trees she grabs and digging in
sideways with each step  the hesitancy of steep dark slopes  rooty and shot through with briers 
a girl with bangs rises and tings her tumbler with a spoon to make an announcement  nobody pays any attention 
now kahn s by custom allowed to come over and sit with them at the best table  post prandially 
wayne and stice both shiver at the same time as the overhead lighting suddenly becomes the big room s primary light 
there s a brief and sort of ignorant discussion on why girls who hit backhands one handed seem prone to having differentsized breasts  hal recalls his brother s late in college thing of seeing if he could take a girl out somewhere public and then meet
and have covert sex with a whole different girl while still out with the first girl  this was after the girl orin had been wildly in
love with and himself had compulsively used in films had been disfigured  orin kept a record of subjects that was sort of a cross
between a chart and a journal  he used to come home and leave it out just pleading to be read  this was back when his brother
orin needed only to have sexual intercourse with them instead of getting them to fall so terribly in love with him they d never be
able to want anyone else  he d taken obscure massage and psych courses and read tantric books whose illustrations seemed about
as sexy to hal as twister 
coyle says  their ankles   everybody ignores him  wayne s already left the table 
little    c bernard makulic  two tables over from the milk dispenser and constitutionally delicate and not long for e t a  
throws up in a silky tan cataract onto the floor by his chair  and there is the shriek of the feet of other chairs being scooted in a star
pattern away from the table  and the protracted vowels of repulsed children 
struck  pemulis  schacht and freer have all had sexual intercourse  coyle s a probable  but reticent  axford has trouble even
publicly showering  much less submitting nude to a female s inspection  hal is maybe the one male e t a  for whom lifetime
virginity is a conscious goal  he sort of feels like o  s having enough acrobatic coitus for all three of them  freer even has a like
souvenir colposcope bolted to the inside of his locker door where a pin up d have been in days of yore  and pemulis and struck
have allegedly patronized the combat zone after the fiscally pressed city d buckled and rehung the combat zone s red lights  east
of the common  but jim troeltsch and sex  no way  and with wayne and stice the question seems somehow beside the point 
hal s mouth feels like it s overflowing with spit  he should by all rights have lost to stice today  and he knows it  stice was in
physical control of the third set  stice choked it away only because he didn t believe he could beat hal yet  deep down  since hal s
competitive explosion  but the crisis of faith that cost stice the match had concerned a different hal  hal can tell  it s now a whole
new hal  a hal who does not get high  or hide  a hal who in    days is going to hand his own personal urine over to authority
figures with a wide smile and exemplary posture and not a secretive thought in his head  no one except pemulis and axford know
it s a whole new and chemical free hal who should by all rights have lost to a    year old out there in public on what ended up a
gorgeous nne autumn day 
wayne had gotten up and bussed his tray in the middle of the jejune breast thing  ortho   the darkness   stice is still staring
into his salad  if you could open stice s head you d see a wheel inside another wheel  gears and cogs being widgeted into place 

 stice has a secret suspicion about a secret that has more to do with the actual table than with the people at the table  a lot of the
guys interpret his intense distraction as stice s still being in the magic can t miss zone from this p m  s match 
 the idea being that nuck girls can only attract guys by being really easy to x  is the joke   coyle says into the noise 
then there s a brief rippling lull in the whole dining hall as little evan ingersoll emerges from the entree line s end on
crutches  his cast new and sailor hat white  unsigned  prorector tony nwangi behind him with his hatchet face stony  carrying the
kid s tray for him  the hall s unease is almost visible  a corona around ingersoll and the ruptured patellar tendon that ll cost him at
least six months of competitive development  penn  whose femoral fracture ll cost him a year  isn t even back yet from st  e  s
orthopedic  but at least ingersoll s back  hal gets up to go over  troeltsch rising to accompany him after a long look at trevor
axford  ingersoll s b b  of record  who s sitting in his chair with his eyes shut tight  unable to make any sort of conciliatory
gesture  a match sore hal not limping but stiff legged and shoulders slightly rolling as he and troeltsch move serpentine around
tables  steering way clear of the custodian and dull steel bucket on rollers and the mop spreading and diluting makulic s chyme
out in a thinning circle that clears three tables  which hal and troeltsch avoid with practiced curves around tables whose layout
they all know well  hal to say hey and how s the limb  troeltsch to say hey and be basically relieved he s away from a
discussion of females as sexual objects  troeltsch s never come close to even dating anybody  some guys here never do  it s the
same at all the academies  this asexual contingent  some junior players don t have the emotional juice left over after tennis to face
what dating requires  bold nerveless guys on the court who go slack and pale at the thought of approaching a female in any social
context  certain things not only can t be taught but can be retarded by other stuff that can be taught  the whole tavis schtitt program here is supposedly a progression toward self forgetting  some find the whole girl issue thing brings them face to face with
something in themselves they need to believe they ve left far behind in order to hang in and develop  troeltsch  shaw  axford  any
sort of sexual tension makes them feel like they need more oxygen than is available right then  a couple of the girls at e t a  are
kind of slutty  and some of the more aggressive freer type guys can break some of the girls down and get them to have sex  
there s nothing if not time and proximity here  but e t a  is mostly a comparatively unsexual place  maybe almost surprisingly so 
considering the constant roar and gurgle here of adolescent glands  the emphasis on physicality  the fears of mediocrity  the backand forth struggles with ego  the loneliness and close proximity  there s scattered homosexuality  much of it emotional and
unconsummated  keith freer s pet theory is that the bulk of e t a  females are nascent lesbians who don t know it yet  that like
any serious female athletes they re basically vigorously male inside  and so sapphic tending  the ones that get to the
w t a        show ll probably be the only ones who find out that they are  he believes   dykes that is  the rest will marry and
spend a lifetime by the club pool wondering why the hair on their husbands  backs makes them shudder  e g  the u s s  millicent
kent  sixteen and phenomenal on the incline bench press  with breasts like artillery and a butt like two bulldogs in a bag  stice s
term  which caught on   already looks like a penal matron  freer likes to observe  and no one likes the fact that carol spodek s
carried and prized the same single large grip donnay stick for going on five straight years 
ortho stice of southwest kansas looks briefly up at hal and troeltsch s departure before returning his attention to a certain
cherry tomato perched somehow halfway up the shallow incline of his salad bowl  it s possible that the cherry tomato is attached
halfway up the incline by an adhesive bit of yogurt dressing rather than just sitting there defying gravity on its own  stice doesn t
use a finger to move the tomato and check this  he s using only his concentrated will  he s trying to will the cherry tomato to roll
of its own objectile power down the incline and into the bowl s center  he stares at the cherry tomato with enormous
concentration  chewing his tri level skinless chicken fillet sandwich  the chewing makes overlapping plates of muscle all the way
up one side of his face and crew cut scalp bulge and roll  he s trying to flex some kind of psychic muscle he s not sure he even
has  the crew cut lends his head an anvil like aspect  complete concentration makes his round red fleshy face look crumpled 
stice is one of those athletes whose body you know is an unearned divine gift because its conjunction with his face is so
incongruous  he resembles a poorly spliced photo  some superhuman cardboard persona with a hole for your human face  a
beautiful sports body  lithe and tapered and sleekly muscled  smooth   like a polycleitos body  hermes or theseus before his
trials   on whose graceful neck sits the face of a ravaged winston churchill  broad and slab featured  swart  fleshy  large pored 
with a mottled forehead under the crew cut s v shaped hairline  and eye pouches  and jowls that hang and whenever he moves
suddenly or lithely make a sort of meaty staccato sound like a wet dog shaking itself dry  tony nwangi is saying something
acerbic to hal  who looks like he s kneeling penitent before ingersoll  everyone at the surrounding tables inclined very subtly
away from hal  troeltsch is signing ingersoll s cast as he speaks into his fist  off the court  ortho slice s flattop crew cut and
penchant for cuff rolled bluejeans and button down short sleeves with a checkered pattern are strictly from hick  the facial
scrunching that attends concentration adds crevices and seams and an uneven flush to the bulldog face  his cheeks are ballooned
with food as he stares at the perched cherry tomato  trying to respect this object with all his might  summoning the sort of
coercive reverence he d felt this p m  as several balls  sudden anomalous swerves against wind and their own vectors half convinced stice they d become sensitive to his inner will  at crucial times  he d mishit one cross court volley and seen the thing head
for an area wide even of the doubles sideline and then curve like a drenched spitter back to land just inside the singles corner  and
this at a time when the grounds  pines behind hal incandenza were breeze leaning in the exact opposite direction  hal had given
stice a little bit of a look on that one  stice couldn t finally tell whether hal noticed anything amiss in the mysterious curves and
downdrafts that seemed to favor the darkness alone  hal had played with the wide eyed but unfocused look of a tennis player
right on the verge of falling apart out there  and yet strangely affectless  as if deep inside some well of his own private troubles 
and stice wills himself again not to wonder what had passed with the headmaster and the o n a n t a  urologist  whose labequipped van s unscheduled appearance in the e t a  parking lot yesterday afternoon had caused a tsunami of panic just before
supper  especially since pemulis and his supply of lab ready visine bottles were nowhere to be found 
even among the small circle who know hal gets secretly high  it doesn t make much sense that hal s misery d be tavis  or
urine related  since pemulis has never seemed blither than today  and if anyone were going to get the boot  chemically or
otherwise  it was not going to be the e t a  administration s relative and second best boy 
hal and his brother mario both know that the skim milk at e t a  has been pre mixed powdered milk since charles tavis
assumed the helm four years back and told mrs  clarke he wanted the kids  animal fat intake halved in a month by any and all
means  the kitchen s graveyard shift power mixes it in enormous steel bowls and then strains out the foam and pours the milk into

 real milk milk dispenser bags for a kind of placebo effect  it s mostly just the concept of powdered milk that gags people 
struck has traded his shiny clean plate for the absent incandenza s fortification structured plate of uneaten fillets  low gluten
bread  corn bread  baby boileds  a pea chickpea based olla  half a fresh squash  mashed potatoes packed in a stelliform gelatin
mold  and a shallow bowl of dessert tsimmes featuring mostly it seemed like plums  hal is still down on one knee by ingersoll s
chair  his elbows on his knee  listening across ingersoll and a blindfolded idris arslanian to tony nwangi  keith freer remarks
blandly on how hal seems like he s feeling sort of punk this evening  checking stice for a reaction  struck utters truisms about
wasting food and global hunger through a full mouth  struck is wearing a sox cap to the side so the bill shadows half his face  the
bread is unkind to his braces  freer is wearing the leather vest with no shirt under  which is what he favors after weights have
pumped his torso full of air  stice had had a traumatic psychic experience at fourteen when he d set the weight on the pull down
station too high  and dr  dolores rusk has authorized his exemption from all but very basic weights  pending resolution of his fear
of weights  the joke around e t a  is that stice  who s surely show bound after graduation  has no fear of heights  but does fear
weights  keith freer  though kind of a second rank junior player  does look beautiful in his calfskin vest   his face and body

marathe remained without expression   police action  
many small birds of the mountain of the outcropping had begun to whistle and twitter somewhere off above and behind them 
also maybe the tentative rattle of some serpent  marathe pretended to search for the watch in his pocket 
steeply said  now  nothing prima facie exceptional about getting attached to a show  god knows i was attached to my share
of shows  that s all it started as  an attachment or habit  thursday nights at  looh   nine o clock eastern  eight o clock central
and mountain   they used to broadcast this  to alert you to when to watch  or if you were going to tape it   marathe watched the
big man shrug from behind   so the show was important to him  so  fine  ok  so he took pleasure in the program  god knows the
guy was entitled   he d worked like a dog his whole life  so ok  so at the start he scheduled his thursday around the show  to an
extent  it was hard to pinpoint anything wrong or consumptive  he was  yes  always home from work by      on thursdays  and
he always had his supper watching the program  it seemed almost cute  mummykins used to tease him  think it was adorable  
 cuteness in fathers  this is rare   there was no way marathe was going to touch the evident u s a  childhood expression
mummykins 
 my old man worked for a heating oil distributorship  home heating oil  have your files got this  a tidbit for m  fortier 
u s o u s  s steeply  h h   late father a heating oil delivery dispatcher  cheery oil  troy  new york  
 state of new york  u s a   prior to reconfiguration  
hugh steeply turned around but not all the way  scratching absently at his wens   but then  syndication   m a s h   the
show was incredibly popular  and after a few years of thursday nights it started also to run daily  during the day  or late at night 
sometimes  in what i remember all too well was called syndication  where local stations bought old episodes and chopped them up
and loaded them with ads  and ran them  and this  note  was while all new episodes of the show were still appearing on thursdays
at       i think this was the start  
 the cuteness  it was over  
 my old man started to find the syndicated reruns extremely important to him  too  as in like not to be missed  
 even though he had viewed and enjoyed them before  these reruns  
 the fucking show ran on two different local stations in the capital district  albany and environs  for a while  this one station
even had a  m a s h  hour  two of them  back to back  every night  from       plus another half an hour in the early p m   for
the unemployed or something  
marathe said  virtually a bombardment of this u s a  broadcast comedy program  
after a brief pause of attention to some wens of the face  steeply said  he started to keep a small television down at work 
down at the distributorship  
 for the broadcast of afternoon  
steeply appeared to marathe uncalculating in his statements   broadcast tvs  toward the end they made some of them really

 small  kind of a pathetic try at keeping cable down  some as small as like wrist size  you d be too young to remember  
 i remember well a pre digital television   marathe  if steeply s anecdote of himself had a political point or communique 
marathe could not yet determine this 
steeply moved his foul belgian cigarette into his right hand to flick it out into the space below   it progressed very slowly 
the gradual immersion  the withdrawal from life  i remember guys from his bowling league calling  that he d quit  our
mummykins found out he d dropped out of knights of columbus  thursdays the jokes and cuteness stopped   him all hunched in
front of the set  barely even eating from his tray  and every night late at night  for the nightly hour  the old man too wide awake 
and hunched over weirdly  head out  as if pulled toward the screen  
 i too have seen this posture of viewing   marathe grimly said  recalling his second oldest of brothers and the canadiens of the
n l  of h 
 and he got anxious  ugly  if something made him miss even one  even one episode  and he d get ugly if you pointed out he d
already seen most of them about seven times before  mummykins began to have to lie to get them out of engagements that would
have infringed  neither of them talked about it  i don t remember any of us trying to name the thing out loud   this dark shift in
his attachment to the program  m a s h    
 the organism of family simply shifted to accommodate  
 which it wasn t even all that consuming an entertainment   steeply said  he sounded to marathe uncalculated and somewhat
younger   i mean it was ok  but it was broadcast tv  broad comedy and canned laughter  
 i am remembering well this rerunning program  do not worry about me   said marathe 
 it was at some point during this gradual shift the notebook first appeared  he began writing notes in a notebook as he viewed 
but only when viewing  m a s h   and he never left the notebook lying around where you could get any kind of look at it  he
wasn t openly secretive about it  you couldn t even point to that and say something was wrong  the  m a s h  notebook just
never seemed to be lying around  
with the hand that was not below the blanket still gripping the sterling ul    marathe was holding his thumb and forefinger
up against the smear of red which was just over the mountains of rincon and craning his neck to see his shadow behind them on
the hillside 
steeply changed the hip which was out  in his standing  to his other hip   as a child  this is when it became impossible to
ignore the odor of obsession about the whole thing  the secrecy about the notebook  and the secrecy about the secrecy  the
scrupulous recording of tiny details  in careful order  for purposes you could just tell were both urgent and furtive  
 this is unbalance   marathe concurred   this attaching of excessive importance  
 jesus  you don t know the half of it  
 and for you also   marathe said   excessive unbalance  for your father progresses downhill in this obsessing  but always so
slowly that always you could question yourself  whether you were maybe yourself the one out of balance  attaching too much
importance to any one thing   a notebook  a posture  crazy making  
 and the toll on mummykins  
marathe had turned the chair to a slight angle to be able to see his shadow  which appeared blunt and deformed by the
topography of the steep hillside above the outcropping  and in general pathetic and small  there would be no titanic or menacing
brockengespenstphanom with the sunrise of dawn  marathe said  the whole organism of family becomes out of balance 
questioning its perceptions  
 the old man   then he started developing this habit of quoting little lines and scenes from  m a s h   to illustrate some
idea  make some point in conversation  at the beginning of the habit he seemed casual about it  as if the little bits and scenes
simply occurred to him  but this changed  but slowly  plus i remember he started seeking out feature films that also featured the
television program s actors  
marathe pretended to sniff 
 then at some point it was as if he was no longer able to converse or communicate on any topic without bringing it back to the
program  the topic  without some system of references to the program   steeply gave small indications of paying attention to the
small squeaks as marathe turned his chair slightly this way and that way  achieving different angles of sight on his small shadow 
steeply exhaled air through the nostrils with a forceful sound   though it wasn t as though he was wholly uncritical of it  
it sometimes from somewhere blue occurred to marathe that he did not dislike this steeply  though like or respect would be
too far in going  to say 
 it was not that type of obsession with it  it  you are saying  
 it was gradual and slow  he started at some point i remember to refer to the kitchen as the mess tent and his den as the
marsh or swamp  these were fictional locations on the show  he began renting films with even crowd extra or cameo
appearances by the program s actors  he bought what was then called a betamixer        a kind of early magnetic video recorder  he began a practice of magnetically recording each week s    broadcasts and reruns  he stored the tapes  organizing them
in baroque systems of cross reference that had nothing discernible to do with dates of recording  i remember mummykins didn t
say anything when he moved his bedding and began to sleep at night in the easy chair in his den  the swamp  or pretend to 
sleep  
 but you had your suspicions of not real sleeping  
 it was gradually obvious he was viewing his magnetic recordings of the program  m a s h  throughout the night  probably
over and over again  using a crude white plastic earplug to hide the noise  scribbling feverishly in his notebook  
in contrast with the violence and transper ant puncturing of the sunset  the dawn sun seemed slowly exhaled from the more
rounded salience of the mountains of rincon  its heat a moister heat and the light the vague red of a type of fond sentiment  and
u s o u s  s steeply s standing shadow was cast back over the outcropping toward marathe behind him  close enough that
marathe might reach his arm out and touch the shadow 
 you can tell i don t have a good recall of the exact progression of the thing   steeply said 
 the gradual  

  i do know that mummykins  i remember one day in the garbage can out behind the house she found a number of letters
addressed to a  m a s h  character named   this i fucking a sure remember   major burns  she found them  
marathe did not allow himself the chuckle   while searching inside the can of waste in the back  for evidence of unbalance  
steeply waved marathe off  he was incapable of amused   she didn t search through the garbage  mumkinsky had too much
class  she probably forgot and threw away the day s troy record before she d clipped her food coupons  she was an inveterate
coupon clipper  
 this was prior to the days of north american laws of recircling       of newspapers  
steeply did not wave off or give a glare  he wore the look of concentrating  this character   this i remember  too well  
was portrayed by i remember the actor maury linville  a plain old employee of   th century fox  
 which later upstarted the fourth network of the large four  
steeply s luridly run makeup from the heat of the day before had now over the night hardened into a configuration of almost
horror   but the letters  the letters were addressed to major burns  not to maury linville  and not c o fox studios or wherever 
but addressed to an involved military address  with a seoul routing code  
 in the south korea of history  
 the letters were hostile  savage  and lavishly descriptive  he d come to think the show s character major burns embodied
some type of cataclysmic  armageddon type theme that was slowly assembling itself on the program and progressively being
hinted at and emerging in the gradual succession of seasons of this  m a s h     steeply felt at his lip   i remember mum mykins
never mentioned the letters  from the garbage  she just left them around where my kid sister and i would see them  
 you are not meaning your sister was a goat  
steeply was not provokable into some different emotion  however  marathe observed   younger sister  but my old man  the
progression of the program from fun to obsession   crucial distinctions had collapsed  i think  now  between the fictional burns
and this linville who portrayed burns  
marathe raised a brow for concurring   this is signifying a severe loss of balance  
 i remember something about he seemed to believe the name of the character burns also somehow hiddenly signified the
english verb for the promise of the consuming fire of apocalypse  
marathe looked puzzled or else squinted because of a rising sun   but he threw the letters into the waste receptacle  you stated 
instead of the snail s mail  
 he d already started missing whole weeks at a time from work  he d been at cheery for decades  he was only a few years
from retirement  
marathe was looking at his lap s blanket s brightening colors of plaid 
 mo cheery and the old man   they d bowled together  they were in knights of columbus together  missing all the weeks of
work made things awkward  mo didn t want to can the old man  he wanted the old man to see somebody  
 a professional person  
 a lot of this i wasn t even there for  the  m a s h  thing  i was at college by the time the really crucial distinctions had
collapsed  
 studying the multiple cultures  
 my kid sister had to keep me abreast of developments during the term  good old mo cheery d come by the house  view
magnetic tapes of the show with the old man a while  listen to the old man s theories and views  then on his way out he d collar
mummykins and take her out into the garage and talk to her very quietly about the fact that the old man was in a high angle
psychic nose dive and needed with all due regard in his opinion to see somebody in the direst fucking way  my kid sister said the
mumkinsky always acted like she had no idea what mo cheery was talking about  
marathe smoothed at his blanket 
 mumkinsky being a type of pet family name   steeply said  looking a little bit of embarrassed 
marathe nodded 
 i m trying to reconstruct this out of memory   steeply said   the old man is by this time pretty much unable to converse about
anything except the television program  m a s h   the theory of the theme of this burns slash burning apocalypse now sort of
spreads out to become huge and complex theories about wide ranging and deeply hidden themes having to do with death and time 
on the show  like evidence of some sort of coded communication to certain viewers about an end to our familiar type of worldtime and the advent of a whole different order of world time  
 your mother continues to play act at normalcy  however  
tm trying to reconstruct things that weren t even clear at the time   steeply said  his wet and then dried makeup now grotesque
in his concentration in the sunrise  like a mask of a mentally ill clown  he said  one theory involved the fact  which the old man
found extremely significant  that the historical korean police action of the u n  lasted only roughly two odd years  but that
 m a s h  itself was by then into something like its seventh year of new episodes  some characters of the program were getting
gray hair  receding hair  face lifts  the old man was convinced this signified intentional themes  according to my kid sister  who
bore the brunt of time spent with him  watching   steeply said   the old man s theories were almost inconceivably complex and
wide ranging  as the years of new seasons went on and some actors retired and characters were replaced by other characters  the
old man generated baroquoco theories about what it was that had quote underline    really  happened to the absent characters 
where they d gone  where they were  what it all augured  then the next thing was one or two of the letters started to appear 
canceled and returned  stamped as unde liverable  or to addresses that were not just nonexistent but absurd  
 unbalanced letters were no longer being discarded as waste  but now mailed  
 and mummykins was uncomplaining throughout  it was enough to break your heart  she was a rock  she did  granted  begin
taking prescription anti anxiety medication  
land of the freely brave  marathe did not say this aloud  he looked at his pocket s watch and was trying to remember a time
when he had ever with steeply had to consider the tact of departing 
steeply  at this time  gave the impression somehow of having several cigarettes going at one time   somewhere along late in

 the progression the old man let it be known he was working on a secret book that revised and explicated much of the world s
military  medical  philosophical and religious history by analogies to certain subtle and complex thematic codes in  m a s h    
steeply would stand on one foot to raise the other foot to look at a shoe s inflicted damage  all the time smoking   even when he
went in to work  there were problems  heating oil customers who called for deliveries or information or whatever began to
complain that the old man kept trying to engage them in bizarre theoretical discussions of the thematics of  m a s h    
 because it is necessary that i leave soon  a central point must be soon emerging   marathe worked in as gracefully as possible 
steeply seemed not to hear this other man  he seemed not only uncalcu lated and self enmeshed  his demeanor itself seemed
more young  that of some young person  this unless this was part of some performance beyond marathe  marathe knew he must
consider 
 then the double blow   steeply said   in b s        my memory s clear on this  the mumkinsky opened an alarming letter
from attorneys for cbs and   th century fox  certain letters had been apparently rerouted by do goodnik military postal clerks to
fox  the old man d been trying to correspond with different past and present  m a s h  personas in letters the family never saw
get mailed but whose content  the attorneys said  raised quote grave concern and could quote constitute grounds for strenuous
legal action   steeply raised the foot to look  his face in pain  he said   then the program s final episode ran  late autumn of b s 
       was on an rotc marching band trip to fort ticonderoga  my kid sister  who d by this time left home herself  and who
could blame the kid  she reported that the mumkinsky was talking very casually and uncomplainingly of the old man s now
refusing to leave his den  
 this  the final enclosing isolation of obsession  
steeply looked over his shoulder on one awkward foot to look slightly at marathe   as in even to go to the bathroom  now  the
not leaving  
 your mother s prescriptions prevented some episodes of great anxiety  i think  
 he d gotten a special a c d c  cable hook up that brought in extra syndication  when reruns weren t running  the videomagnetic tapes ran constantly  he was haggard and spectral and his easy chair was all but unrecognizable  cheery oil was keeping
him on the books until he could get his thirty years in at age sixty  my kid sister and i started reluctantly discussing intervening on
mummykins to intervene on the old man and force him to see somebody  
 yourselves  you could not reach him  
 he died just before his birthday  he died in his easy chair  set at full recline  watching an episode in which alda s hawkeye
can t stop sleepwalking and fears he s going out of his fucking mind until a professional military therapist reassures him  i
remember  
 me  i too have seen this episode rerunning  in my childhood  
 all i can recall of it is the army professional telling alda not to worry  that if he was truly crazy he d sleep like a newborn  as
did the notorious burns slash linville  
 the program s character of burns slept exceptionally well  i remember  
 his secret book s manuscript filled scores of notebooks  this is what the notebooks turned out to be  one closet in the den
had to be forced open  all these notebooks tumbled out  the whole thing was written in a kind of medical slash military looking
code  though  indecipherable   sis and her first husband and i spent some time trying to decode them  after his death in the
chair  
 his unbalance of temptation cost him life  an otherwise harmless u s a  broadcast television program took his life  because
of the consuming obsession  this is your anecdote  
 no  it was a transmural infarction  blew out a whole ventricle  his whole family had a history  the heart  the pathologist said
it was amazing he d lasted this long  
marathe shrugged   the obsessed frequently endure  
steeply shook the head   it must have been hell on the poor old mumkinsky  
 she never complained  however  
already the sun was up and pulsing  light ran over everything in a sickening yellow way like gravy  all birds and living
animals had been silenced  stunned already by heat  and the site s bright loaders had not yet been started in movement  all was
calm  all was bright  steeply s shadow on the shelf was squat and blunt  already shorter than the living figure of steeply himself 
who was leaning outward to try to find a spot far below to litter with a crumpled belgian packing with one prayed no more finally
to smoke 
marathe took his watch from out of the windbreaker s pocket 
steeply shrugged   i think you re right  that it s part of both the horror and the pull  when i m east and thinking of flatto s lab
and i sort of look up and find myself tempted  
 about the entertainment of now  
 and i kind of half picture hank hoyne in the old man s old recliner  hunched and scribbling feverishly  
 in military coding  
 his eyes  they got like that  too  the old man s  like hoyne s  periodically  
heat began to shimmer  as well  off the lionhide floor of a desert  the mesquite and cactus wobbled  and tucson az resumed
once more the appearance of the mirage  as it had appeared when marathe had first arrived and found his shadow so entrancing in
its size and reach  the sun of a m  had no radial knives of light  it appeared brutal and businesslike and harmful to look upon 
marathe allowed himself a few diverting seconds of watching the mountains of the rincons  widening shadows melt slowly
backward into the base of the mountains of the rincons  steeply hawked and spat  still holding the last crumpled pack of
flanderfumes 
 my time is sharply finite to remain   marathe said this  every change of his postures brought small squeaks of leather and
metal   i would feel gratitude if you departed first  
steeply figured marathe wanted him to have no idea how he got up and down  in and out  to no real purpose  a personal point
of pride  steeply squatted for adjusting the straps of his high heels  his prostheses were still not quite aligned  he spoke with the

 faintly breathless quality of large men trying to bend 
 well  remy  but i don t think dick willis s  empty of intent  quite does it  captures it  the eye factor  hoyne  the arab
internist  the old man  not for eyes like that  
 you would say it does not capture these eyes  expression  
looking up while squatting  this made steeply s neck appear thick  he stared past marathe  at the shale  he said  the
expressions seem more like   fuck  how to say it  fuck   steeply said in concentration 
 petrified   marathe said   ossified  inanimate  
 no  not inanimate  more like the opposite  more as if    stuck in some way  
marathe s neck itself was stiff from so much time looking out and down from a height   what is it this wishes here to mean 
glued  
steeply was doing something to a toenail s cracked polish   stuck  fixed  held  trapped  as in trapped in some sort of middle 
between two things  pulled apart in different directions  
marathe s eyes searched the sky  which this was already too light blue for his pleasure  filmed with a sort of eggy plura of
heat   meaning between different cravings of great intensity  this  
 not even cravings so much  emptier than that  as if he were stuck wondering  as if there was something he d forgotten  
 misplaced  lost  
 misplaced    lost    misplaced    as you wish  

   november year of the depend adult undergarment
    h   ennet house  the hours that are truly wee  eugenio m   voluntarily filling in for johnette foltz on dream duty  is out
in the office playing some sort of hand held sports game that blips and tweets  kate gompert and geoffrey day and ken erdedy
and bruce green are in the living room with the lights mostly out and the old jumpy picture d e c  viewer on  cartridges not
allowed after     h   to encourage sleep  sober cocaine and stimulant addicts sleep pretty well by the second month  straight
alcoholics by the fourth  abstinent pot  and tranq addicts can pretty much forget about sleep for the first year  though bruce
green is asleep and would be in violation of the no lying on the couch rule if his legs weren t twisted over and his feet on the
floor  all the ennet house viewer gets on spontaneous dissemination is basic interlace  and from      to      interlace nne
downloads for the next dissemination day and cuts all transmissions except one line s four straight redissemms of  the mr 
bouncety bounce daily program   and when mr  bouncety bounce appears in his old cloth and safety pin diaper and paunch and
rubber infant head mask he is not a soothing or pleasant figure at all  for the sleepless adult  ken erdedy has started to smoke
cigarettes and sits smoking  joggling one leather slipper  kate gompert and geoffrey day are on the nonleather couch  kate
gompert sits cross legged on the couch with her head all the way forward so her forehead touches her foot  it looks like some kind
of spiritually advanced yoga position or stretching exercise  but it s really just the way kate gompert has been sitting on the sofa
all night every night since wednesday s free for all unpleasantness with lenz and gately in the streetlet  from which the whole
house is still reeling and spiritually palsied  day s bare calves are completely hairless and look sort of absurd with dress shoes and
black socks and a velour bathrobe  but day s proven kind of admirably resistant to caring what other people think  in a way 
 like you really care   kate gompert s voice is toneless and hard to hear because it issues from out of the circle formed by her
crossed legs 
 it isn t a question of caring or not caring   day says quietly   i meant only that i identify to an extent  
gompert s sarcastic chuff of air raises a section of her unwashed bangs 
bruce green doesn t snore  even with his nose broken and cross hatched in white tape  neither he nor erdedy is listening to
them 
day speaks softly and doesn t cross his legs to incline over to the side toward her   when i was a little boy   
gompert chuffs air again 
   just a boy with a violin and a dream and special roundabout routes to school to avoid the boys who took my violin case
and played keep away over my head with it  one summer afternoon i was upstairs in the bedroom i shared with my younger
brother  alone  practicing my violin  it was very hot  and there was an electric fan in the window  blowing out  acting as an
exhaust fan  
 i know from exhaust fans  believe you me  
 the direction of flow is beside the point  it was on  and its position in the window made the glass of the upraised pane vibrate
somehow  it produced an odd high pitched vibration  invariant and constant  by itself it was strange but benign  but on this one
afternoon  the fan s vibration combined with some certain set of notes i was practicing on the violin  and the two vibrations set up
a resonance that made something happen in my head  it is impossible really to explain it  but it was a certain quality of this
resonance that produced it  
 a thing  
 as the two vibrations combined  it was as if a large dark billowing shape came billowing out of some corner in my mind  i
can be no more precise than to say large  dark  shape  and billowing  what came flapping out of some backwater of my psyche i
had not had the slightest inkling was there  
 but it was inside you  though  
 katherine  kate  it was total horror  it was all horror everywhere  distilled and given form  it rose in me  out of me 
summoned somehow by the odd confluence of the fan and those notes  it rose and grew larger and became engulfing and more
horrible than i shall ever have the power to convey  i dropped my violin and ran from the room  
 was it triangular  the shape  when you say billowing  do you mean like a triangle  
 shapeless  shapelessness was one of the horrible things about it  i can say and mean only shape  dark  and either billowing or
flapping  but because the horror receded the moment i left the room  within minutes it had become unreal  the shape and horror 
it seemed to have been my imagination  some random bit of psychic flatulence  an anomaly  

 a mirthless laugh into the ankle   alcoholics anomalous  
day hasn t switched legs or moved  and he isn t looking at her ear or her scalp  which are in view   in just the way any child
will probe a wound or pick at a scab i returned shortly to the room and the fan and picked up the violin again  and produced the
resonance again immediately  and immediately again the black flapping shape rose in my mind again  it was a bit like a sail  or a
small part of the wing of something far too large to be seen in totality  it was total psychic horror  death  decay  dissolution  cold
empty black malevolent lonely voided space  it was the worst thing i have ever confronted  
 but you still forgot and went back up there and brought it back  and it was inside you  
completely incongruously  ken erdedy says  his head s shaped like a mushroom   day has no idea what he was referring to
or talking about 
 set free somehow by that one day only resonance of violin and fan  the dark shape began rising out of my mind s corner on
its own  i dropped the violin again and ran from the room once again  clutching my head at the front and back  but this time it did
not recede  
 the triangular horror  
 it was as if i d awakened it and now it was active  it came and went for a year  i lived in horror of it for a year  as a child 
never knowing when it would rise up billowing and blot out all light  after a year it receded  i think i was ten  but not all the way 
i d awakened it somehow  every so often  every few months it would rise inside me  
it isn t like a real interface or conversation  day doesn t seem to be addressing anybody in particular   the last time it ever rose
up billowing was my second year of college  i attended brown university in providence ri  graduating magna cum laude  one
sophomore night it came up out of nowhere  the black shape  for the first time in years  
 but there was an inevitability feeling about it  too  when it came  
 it is the most horrible feeling i have ever imagined  much less felt  there is no possible way death can feel as bad  it rose up 
it was worse now that i was older  
 tell me all about it  
 i thought i d have to hurl myself out of my dormitory s window  i simply could not live with how it felt  
gompert s head isn t all the way up  but now it s about halfway up  her forehead has a major red impression spot from her
ankle bone  she s looking roughly halfway between straight ahead and day beside her   and there was this idea underneath that
you d brought it on  that you d wakened it up  you went back up to the fan that second time  you like despised yourself for waking
it up  
day is looking straight ahead  mr  bouncety bounce s head is in no way mushroom shaped  though it is large and   in the
rubber infant mask   apt to appear to the adult viewer kind of grotesque   some boy i hardly knew in the room below mine heard
me staggering around whimpering at the top of my lungs  he came up and sat up with me until it went away  it took most of the
night  we didn t converse  he didn t try to comfort me  he spoke very little  just sat up with me  we didn t become friends  by
graduation i d forgotten his name and major  but on that night he seemed to be the piece of string by which i hung suspended over
hell itself  
green in his sleep cries out something that sounds like  for god s sake no mr  ho don t light it   his swollen black eyes and
r e m  s non sequiturs  plus the capering     kilo infant on the viewer  plus day and gompert conversing while both staring into
space  all backed by the blurps and wonks of gene m  s hand held game in the office  give the dark living room a dreamy and
almost surreal atmosphere 
day finally uncrosses his legs and switches them   it s never come back  over twenty years  but i ve not forgotten  and the
worst times i have felt since then were like a day at the foot masseur s compared to the feeling of that black sail or wing rising
inside me  
 billowing  
 not the nuts jesus god not the nutsss  
 i understood the term hell as of that summer day and that night in the sophomore dormitory  i understood what people meant
by hell  they did not mean the black sail  they meant the associated feelings  
 or the corner it came up out of  inside  if they mean a place   kate gompert is now looking at him  her face doesn t look
better but does look different  her neck s clearly stiff from having been contorted 
 from that day  whether i could articulate it satisfactorily or not   day says  holding the knee of the leg just crossed   i
understood on an intuitive level why people killed themselves  if i had to go for any length of time with that feeling i d surely kill
myself  
 time in the shadow of the wing of the thing too big to see  rising  
 oh god please   green says very distinctly 
day says   there is no way it could feel worse

pulled up alongside stice and wayne just as they cleared the hammond golf course  hal a good half km  behind them with
galumphers kornspan and kahn  schtitt was inscrutable about the whole thing  the match wasn t like a ladder challenge  stice
and hal were in different age divisions this year  the match was more like maybe an exhibition  and by the second set  as people
got done with the weight room and showers  it was attended like one  the match  helen steeply of moment  possessed of a certain
thuggish allure but hardly the pericardium piercer that orin had made her sound like  to hal  sat through the whole thing 
accompanied for the first set by aubrey delint before thierry poutrincourt stole his spot on the bleacher  it was the first highcaliber junior tennis she d ever seen  she said  the massive journalist  they played on     the best of the east show courts  also
the scene of some of the recent eschaton s worst carnage  it was a conditioning heavy day  a very light schedule of matches  bags
of smoke burped steadily up from schtitt s crow s nest high overhead  and sometimes you could hear the weatherman s pointer

 tapping absently on the transom s iron  the only other thing nearby was down on      a challenge in girls     s  two baseliners
sending parabolas back and forth  ponytails  an air of baseline attrition  the ball s high heavy arc that of a loogy spat for distance 
shaw and axford were also way out on        warming up  no one paid them or the    s much mind  the bleachers behind the
show court filled steadily up  schtitt had mario film the whole first set from above  leaning way out over the transom s railing
with watson braced and gripping his vest from behind  mario s police lock protruding and casting a weird needly shadow slanted
northeast of court   s net 
 this is the first real match i ve seen  after hearing so much about the junior tour   helen steeply told delint  trying to cross
her legs on a cramped bleacher a few tiers from the top  aubrey delint s smile was notoriously bad  his face seeming to break into
crescents and shards  wholly without cheer  it was almost more like a grimace  orders that delint keep the mammoth soft profiler
in direct sight at all times were explicit and emphatic  helen steeply had a notebook  and delint was filling in both players  names
on performance charts schtitt won t ever let anyone look at 
the p m  was moving fast from a chilly noon cloud cover into blue autumn glory  but in the first set it was still very cold  the
sun still pale and seeming to flutter as if poorly wired  hal and stice didn t have to stretch and barely warmed up at all  after the
run  they d changed clothes and were both expressionless  stice was in all black  hal in e t a  sweats with his left shoe s upper
bulging distended around his airstirrup brace 
a born net man  ortho stice played with a kind of rigid  liquid grace  like a panther in a back brace  he was shorter than hal
but better built and with quicker feet  a southpaw with factory painted w s on his wilson pro staff     si s 
hal was left handed too  which complicated strategy and percentages hideously  delint told the journalist beside him 
the darkness s service motion was in the mcenroe esconja tradition  legs splayed  feet parallel  a figure off an egyptian
frieze  side so severely to the net he s almost facing away  both arms out straight and stiff on the serve s downswing  hal bobbed
on his feet s balls a little in the ad court  waiting  stice started his service motion motion in little segments   it looks a little like
bad animation   then grimaced  tossed  pivoted netward and served it with a hard flat spang way out to hal s forehand  pulling
hal wide  the finish of stice s pivot lets his momentum carry him naturally up to net  following the serve  hal lunged for the serve
and chipped a little forehand return down the line and scrambled right to get back into court  the return was lucky  a feeble chip
that just cleared the net s tape  so shallow that stice had to half volley it at the service line  still moving in  his backhand twohanded and clumsy for half volleys  he had to sort of scoop it and hit up soft so it wouldn t float out deep  axiom  the man who
has to hit up from the net is going to get passed  and stice s half volley landed in the ad court squishy and slow and sat up for hal 
who was waiting for it  hal s stick was back for the forehand  waiting  and there was a moment of total mentation as the ball hung
there  statistically  hal was book to pass a left handed volleyer cross court off a ball this ripe  though he also always loved a good
humiliating topspin lob  and stice s fractional chance at saving the point was to guess what hal would do   stice couldn t crowd
the net because hal would put it up over him  he stayed a couple stick lengths off the net  leaning for a cross  everything seemed
to hang distended in air now so clear it seemed washed  after the clouds  the bleachers  people could feel hal feel stice letting the
point go  inside  figuring it lost  knowing he could only guess and stab  hoping  little hope of hal fucking up  hal incandenza
does not fuck up passes off floater half volleys  hal s forehand s wind up was nicely disguised  prepped for either lob or pass 
when he hit it so hard his forearm s musculature stood starkly out it was a pass but not cross court  he went inside out on it  a flat
forehand as hard as he could from the baseline s center back toward stice s deuce sideline  stice had finally guessed lob at the start
of the stroke and had half turned to sprint back for where it would land  and the inside out pass wrong footed him  he could do no
more than stand there flat footed and watching as the fresh ball landed a meter fair to get hal back to deuce in the fifth game 
there was applause off thirty hands for the point as a whole  which was faultless and on hal s part imaginative  anti book  one of
very few total inspired points from incandenza  delint s chart would show  neither player s face moved as a couple people
shouted for hal  the basic ten level r a s u        from the universal bleacher co  sat right behind the court  at the start it was
mostly staff and the a s who were running alongside when thode brought stice and hal the directive to play  but the stands
gradually filled as word got down to the locker rooms that the darkness was playing    s a   dead even in the first set of
something schtitt had actually dispatched a scooter to order  the bleachers  e t a s hunched forward with hands warmed in the
crease between hamstrings and calves  or else gloved and layered and stretched out with their heads and bottoms and heels on
three different levels  watching both sky and play  the lozenges of shadow from the court s mesh fences elongated as the sun
wheeled southwest to west  several sets of legs and sneakers hung swinging from the transom above  mario allowed himself
several reaction shots from staff and partisans in the bleachers  aubrey delint spent the set with the punter s ca thected profiler 
who allegedly came to see hal only about orin but whom charles tavis won t let see hal yet  even chaperoned  tavis s reasons
for the reticence too detailed for helen steeply to understand  probably  but she was watching from the show bleachers  top row 
poised over a notebook  wearing a fuchsia ski cap with a rooster comb top instead of a pompom top  blowing into her fist  her
weight making the bleacher below her bow and inclining delint oddly toward her  for the spectators not perched on the transom
overhead  the players looked waffle cut by the chain link fencing  the green windscreens that wrecked spectation were used only
in the spring in the weeks right after the lung s disassembly  delint hadn t stopped talking into the big lady s ear 
all the e t a  players loved the show courts     because they loved to be watched  and also hated the show courts because
the transom s crow s nested shadow covered the north halves of the courts around noon and all through the p m  wheeled around
gradually east like some giant hooded shadowed moving presence  brooding  sometimes just the sight of schtitt s little head s
shadow could make a younger kid on the show courts clutch and freeze  by hal and stice s seventh game  the sky was cloudless 
and the transom s monolithic shadow  black as ink  gave everyone watching the fantods as it elongated along the nets  completely
obscuring slice when he followed a serve in  another advantage of the lung was that it afforded no overhead view  which was
one more reason why staff waited as long as possible before its erection  there was no indication hal even saw it  the shadow 
hunched and waiting for stice 
the darkness splayed out stiff on the deuce side of the center line  ratcheting slowly into his service motion  he overhit the
first serve long and hal angled it softly off court  moving two steps in for the second ball  stice hit his second serve as hard as he
could again and netted it  and pursed his thick lips a little as he walked into the net s shadow to retrieve the ball  and hal jogged
over to the fence behind the next court to get the ball he d angled over  delint was putting a pejorative hieroglyphic in a box on

 his chart marked stice 
at just this moment        meters east and downhill and one level below ground  ennet house live in staff don gately lay
deeply asleep in his lone rangerish sleeping mask  his snores rattling the deinsulated pipes along his little room s ceiling 
four odd clicks to the northwest in the men s room of the armenian foundation library  right near the onion domed
watertown arsenal  poor tony krause hunched forward in a stall in his ghastly suspenders and purloined cap  his elbows on his
knees and his face in his hands  getting a whole new perspective on time and the various passages and personae of time 
m  m  pemulis and j  g  struck  wet haired after their p m  runs  had blarneyed their way past the library attendant at the
b u  school of pharmacy     clicks down commonwealth on comm  and cook st  and were seated at a table in reference 
pemulis s yachting cap pushed way back to accommodate his rising eyebrows  licking his finger to turn pages 
h  steeply s green sedan with its neuralgiac full front nunhagen ad on the side sat in an authorized guest parking spot in the
e t a  lot 
between appointments        in an office whose west windows yielded no view of the match  charles tavis had his head
mashed up against the upholstered seat rail of his sofa  his arm under the gray and red ruffle and sweeping back and forth for the
bathroom scale he keeps under there 
avril incandenza s whereabouts on the grounds were throughout this interval unknown 
at just this moment m s t   orin incandenza was once again embracing a certain  swiss  hand model before a wall width
window in a rented suite halfway up a different tall hotel  from before  in phoenix az  the win dowlight was fiery with heat 
way below  tiny cars  roofs glared so bright with reflected light their colors were obscured  pedestrians hunched and sprinted
between different areas of shade and refrigeration  the cityscape s glass and metal twinkled but seemed to sag   the whole vista
looked somehow stunned  the cool air through the room s vent whispered  they d put down their glasses of ice and come together
upright and embraced  the embrace was not like a hug  there was no talking   the only sound was the vent and their breath 
orin s linen knee probed the deltoid fork of the hand model s parted legs  he let the  swiss  woman grind against the muscular
knee of his good leg  they got so close no light shone between them  and ground together  her lids fluttered  his closed  their
breath became somehow coded  again the concentrated tactile languor of the sexual mode  again they stripped each other to the
waist and she  in that same kind of jitterbug jape they didn t have the breath to laugh at  she hopped up at him and forked her legs
the same way over his shoulders and arched back until his arm stopped her fall and he supported her like that  the left hand horned
with old callus at the small of her satiny back  and bore her 
sometimes it s hard to believe the sun s the same sun over all different parts of the planet  the nne sun was at this same
moment the color of hollandaise and gave off no heat  between points  both hal and slice switched their sticks to their right hands
and clamped their left hands tight under their arms to keep from losing sensation in the chill  stice was double faulting more than
his average because he was trying to get enough on his second serve to follow it credibly to net  delint estimated he was charting
stice at one double fault per     games  and his a  d f  ratio       was an undistinguished     but he  delint  told helen steeply of
moment  spread way out next to him on the third row from the top and using gregg shorthand  delint told this ms  steeply that
stice was nevertheless wise to crank the second serve and eat the occasional double fault  stice wound up to serve so stiff  his
motion so sprocketed and serial  that the journalist told delint stice looked to her as if he d learned to serve by studying still
photos of the motion s different stages  no offense intended  there was none of real highspeed motion s liquid flow until the very
end  when stice pivoted toward the net and seemed to sort of fall out into the court  his tennis racquet whirling behind his back
and snapping upward to impact the yellow ball hanging at just the height of his maximum reach  and there was a solid pock as this
stice cracked it flat into orin s brother s body  handcuffing hal at such speeds the ball s movement presented only as afterimage 
the creamy retinal trail of something too fast to track  hal s awkward return had too much slice  and floated  and stice hurtled
forward to volley it chest high  blocking it acute into open court for a clean winner  there was mild applause  delint invited
helen steeply to note that the darkness really won that point on the serve itself  hal incandenza walked to the fence to retrieve
the ball  impassive  wiping his nose against his sweatshirt s sleeve  ad in  hal was up     in the first and had saved three ads off
stice s fifth service game  two off double faults  but delint still maintained stice was wise 
 hal s got to the point in the last year here where a kid s only real chance is to totally press  attack at all times  whale the serve 
haul ass to the net  assume the aggressor role  
 does herr schtitt wear eye makeup   helen steeply asked him   i was noticing  
 you stay back against this hal kid  you try to out think him and move him around  he ll yank you back and forth and chew
you up and spit you out and step on the remains  we ve spent years getting him to this point  nobody stays back and out controls
incandenza anymore  
pretending to flip to a fresh page  helen steeply dropped her pen  which fell into the bleachers  struts and supports and
clattered as only something dropped into a system of metal bleachers can clatter  the prolonged noise made stice take some extra
bounces before he served  he bounced the ball several times  leaning forward  lined up splayed and violently sideways  he went
into his odd segmented windup  helen steeply produced another pen from the pocket of her fiberfill parka  stice cracked it flat
down the center  aiming for an ace on the service lines  t  it went by hal unplayable and literally too close to call  there are no
linesmen for internal e t a  matches  hal looked down the line at where the thing hit and skidded  pausing before indicating his
call  the hand to his cheek indicating deliberation  he shrugged and shook his head and laid a hand out flat in the air before him to
signify to slice he was calling the serve good  this meant game stice  the darkness was walking toward the net  kneading his
neck  looking at where hal was still standing 
 we can go on and play two   stice said   didn t see it neither  
hal was coming in closer to stice because he was going to the net post for his towel   not your job to see it   he looked
unhappy and tried to smile   you hit it too hard to see  you deserve the point  
stice shrugged and nodded  chewing   you take the next gimme then   he sliced two balls soft so they ended their roll down
near the opposite baseline  where hal could use them to serve  the darkness still made huge man dibular chewing faces on court
even though he hadn t been allowed to chew gum in play since he accidentally inhaled gum and had to be heimliched by his
opponent in the semis of last spring s easter bowl 

  ortho s saying how the next debatable call goes immediately to hal  they don t take two   delint said  darkening in halfsquares on the two charts 
 take two  
 play a let  babe  do it over  two serves  one point   aubrey delint was a lightly pockmarked man with thick yellow hair in an
anchorman s helmety style and a hypertensive flush  and eyes  oval and close set and lightless  that seemed like a second set of
nostrils in his face   do a whole lot of sports at moment do you  
 so they re being sporting   steeply said   generous  fair  
 we inculcate that as a priority here   delint said  gesturing vaguely at the space around them  head bent to his charts 
 they seem like friends  
 the angle here for moment might be the good friends off the court and remorseless pitiless foes on court angle  
 i mean they seem like friends even playing   helen steeply said  watching hal dry off his leather grip with a white towel as
stice jumped up and down in place back at his deuce corner  one hand in his armpit 
delint s laugh sounded to steeply s keen ear like the laugh of a much older and less fit man  the mucoidal fist at chest laugh
of a lap blanketed old man in a lawn chair on his gravel backyard in scottsdale az  hearing his son say his wife claimed no longer
to know who he was   don t kid yourself  babe   de lint got out  the vaught twins on the bleacher below looked up and around
and pretended to shush him  the left mouth grinning  delint with that bad cold eyed shard of a smile back at them as hal
incandenza bounced the ball three times and went into his own service motion 
several little boys were strung busily out along the sides of a small utility tunnel twenty six meters below the show courts 
steeply s face looked as if the journalist were trying to think of pithy images for a motion as unexceptional and fluid as hal
incandenza s serve  at the start a violinist maybe  standing alert with his sleek head cocked and racket up in front and the hand
with the ball at the racket s throat like a bow  the down together up together of the downswing and toss could be a child making
angels in the snow  cheeks rosy and eyes at the sky  but hal s face was pale and thoroughly unchildlike  his gaze somehow
extending only half a meter in front of him  he looked nothing like the punter  the service motion s middle might be a man at a
precipice  falling forward  giving in sweetly to his own weight  and the serve s terminus and impact a hammering man  the driven
nail just within range at the top of his tiptoed reach  but all these were only parts  and made the motion seem segmented  when the
smaller crew cutted jowly boy was the one with the stuttered motion  the man of parts  steeply had played tennis only a couple
times  with his wife  and had felt ungainly and simian out there  the punter s discourses on the game had been lengthy but not
much use  it was unlikely that any one game figured much in the entertainment 
hal incandenza s first serve was a tactically aggressive shot but not immediately identifiable as such  stice wanted to serve so
hard he could set himself up to put the ball away on the next shot  up at net  hal s serve seemed to set in motion a much more
involved mechanism  one that took several exchanges to reveal itself as aggressive  his first serve hadn t stice s pace  but it had
depth  plus a topspin hal achieved with an arched back and faint brushing action over the back of the ball that made the serve
curve visibly in the air  egg shaped with spin  to land deep in the box and hop up high  so that stice couldn t do more than send
back a deep backhand chip from shoulder height  and then couldn t come in behind a return that d been robbed of all pace  stice
moved to the baseline s center as the chip floated back to hal  hal s pivot moved him right so he could take it on the forehand        another looper dripping with top  right back in the same corner he d served to  so that stice had to stop and sprint
back the same way he d come  stice drove this backhand hard down the line to hal s forehand  a blazing thing that made the
audience inhale  but as the samizdat s director s other son glided a few strides left steeply could see that he now had a whole open
court to hit cross court into  stice having hit so hard he d backpedalled a bit off the shot and was now scrambling to get back out
of the deuce corner  arid hal hit the flat textbook drive cross court into green lined space  hard but not flamboyantly so  and the
diagonal of the ball kept it travelling out wide after it hit stice s ad sideline  carrying it away from the boy in black s outstretched
racquet  and for a second it looked as if stice at a dead run might get his strings on the ball  but the ball stayed tantalizingly just
out of reach  still travelling at a severe cross court diagonal  and it passed slice s racquet half a meter past its rim  and slice s
momentum carried him almost halfway into the next court  stice slowed to a jog to go retrieve the ball  hal stood slightly hipshot
on the ad side  waiting for stice to get back and let him serve again  delint  whose peripheral vision s acuity and disguise was an
e t a  legend  observed the big journalist chew her nib for a second and then put down nothing more than the gregg ideogram for
pretty  shaking her fuchsia cap 
 wasn t that pretty   he said blandly 
steeply rooted for a hankie   not exactly  
 hal s in essence a torturer  if you want his essence as a player  instead of a straight out killer like stice or the canadian
wayne   delint said   this is why you don t stay back or play safe against hal  this way of the ball seeming just in reach  to keep
you trying  running  he yanks you around  always two or three shots ahead  he won that point on the deep forehand after the
serve   the second he had stice wrong footed you could see the angle open up  though the serve set the whole thing up in
advance  and without the risk of much pace on it  the kid doesn t need pace  we ve helped him find  
 when might i get a chance to talk to him  
 incandenza took a lot of bringing along  he didn t used to quite have the complete game to be able to do this  slice the court
up into sections and chinks  then all of a sudden you see light through one of the chinks and you see he s been setting up the angle
since the start of the point  it makes you think of chess  
the journalist blew her red nose     chess on the run  
 nice term  
hal went into his service motion to the ad court 
 do the students play chess here  
a mirthless chuckle   no time  
 do you play chess  
stice hit a backhand winner off hal s second serve  mild applause 
 i don t have time to play anything   delint said  filling in a square 

 you could tell by the sound that the other boy s racquet was strung tighter than hal s 
 when do i get to sit down with hal directly  
 i don t know  i don t think you do  
the journalist s rapid head movement reconfigured the flesh of her neck   pardon me  
 it s not my decision  my guess is you don t  dr  tavis didn t already tell you  
t really couldn t tell what he was telling me  
 we ve never had a kid here interviewed  the founder let you guys on the grounds  versus tavis this is an exception your
even getting in  
 i m here for background only  for your alumnus  the punter  
delint was making his lips look like he was whistling even though no whistling sound was emerging   we ve never let
somebody do any kind of interview on a kid here while he s still in training and inculcation  
 does the student have some sort of say in who he talks to and why  what if the boy wants to chat with me about his brother s
transition from tennis to football  
delint kept his concentration on the match and the chart in a way that was supposed to let you know you had very little of his
attention   talk to tavis about it  
 i was in there for over two hours  
 you pick up how to do questions with him after a while  tavis you have to back into a yes no corner where you can finally
say i need a yes or a no  it takes about twenty minutes if you re sharp  this is your whole business  getting answers out of people 
the answer s not for me to officially say  but i m guessing a no  the boston press guys come around after a big event  they get
match results and physical stats and hometowns and nothing more  
 moment is a national magazine for and about exceptional people  not some sportswriter with a cigar and a deadline  
 it s a command decision  babe  i m not in command  i know they teach us to teach that this place is about seeing instead of
being seen  
 i m here only for the human interest perspective of a talented boy on his talented brother s bold transition to a major sport
where he s shown himself to be even more talented  one exceptional brother on another  hal is not the profile s focus  
 get tavis in the right corner and he ll tell you about seeing and being seen  these kids  the best of them are here to learn to
see  schtitt s thing is self transcendence through pain  these kids    gesturing at stice running madly up for a drop volley that
stopped rolling well inside the service line  mild applause    they re here to get lost in something bigger than them  to have it
stay the way it was when they started  the game as something bigger  at first  then they show talent  start winning  become big
fish in their ponds out there in their hometowns  stop being able to get lost inside the game and see  fucks with a junior s head 
talent  they pay top dollar to come here and go back to being little fish and to get savaged and feel small and see and develop  to
forget themselves as objects of attention for a few years and see what they can do when the eyes are off them  they didn t come
here to get read about as some soft news item or background  babe  
delint read steeply s expression as some kind of tic  the tiniest tuft of nostril hair protruded from one of her nostrils  which
delint found repellent  she said   were you ever written about  as a player  
delint smiled coolly at his charts   never had the sort of ranking or promise this issue d even come up for me  
 but some of these do  hal s brother did  
delint felt along his lip s outline with his pencil  sniffed   orin was ok  orin was essentially a one trick pony as a player 
and between you and me and the fence he was kind of a head case  his game left here on the downswing  now his little brother s
got a future in tennis if he wants  and ortho  wayne for sure  a couple of the girls   kent  caryn and sharyn here   indicating
the vaught apparition below them   the really gifted ones  the ones that make it out of here still on the upswing  if they get to the
show    
 meaning professional you mean  
 in the show they ll get all they want of being made into statues to be looked at and poked at and discussed  and then some 
for now they re here to get to be the ones who look and see and forget getting looked at  for now  
 but even you call it  the show   they ll be entertainers  
 you bet your ass they will be  
 so audiences will be the whole point  why not also prepare them for the stresses of entertaining an audience  get them used
to being seen  
the two boys were at the near net post  stice blowing his nose into a towel  delint made kind of a show of putting his
clipboard down   assume wrongly for a second that i can speak for the enfield academy  i say you do not get it  the point here
for the best kids is to inculcate their sense that it s never about being seen  it s never  if they can get that inculcated  the show
won t fuck them up  schtitt thinks  if they can forget everything but the game when all of you out there outside the fence see only
them and want only them and the game s incidental to you  for you it s about entertainment and personality  it s about the statue 
but if they can get inculcated right they ll never be slaves to the statue  they ll never blow their brains out after winning an event
when they win  or dive out a third story window when they start to stop getting poked at or profiled  when their blossom starts to
fade  whether or not you mean to  babe  you chew them up  it s what you do  
 we chew statues  
 whether you mean to or no  you  moment  world tennis  self  inter lace  the audiences  the crowds in italy fucking
literally  it s the nature of the game  it s the machine they re all dying to throw themselves into  they don t know the machine  but
we do  gerhardt s teaching them to see the ball out of a place inside that can t be chewed  it takes time and total focus  the man s a
fucking genius  profile schtitt  if you want to profile somebody  
 and i m not going to be allowed even to ask the students what it looks like  this inside chew proof place  it s a secret place  
hal mishit a second serve and it flew off his frame and way down to where the girls were sending each other squeaks and
lobs  and stice had now broken him to go up      and the murmurs in the bleachers were like a courtroom at an unpleasant
revelation  delint rounded his lips and made a kind of bovine sound in ortho stice s direction  hal chipped his balls out along the

 baseline and made some small adjustments in his cross hatched strings as he walked around for the side change  a couple of the
nastier kids applauded hal s mishit a little 
 get sardonic with me all you want  i already said it s not my command decision  i wouldn t get sardonic with tavis  though  
 but if it were  your command  
 lady  if it was me you d be pressing your nose between the bars of the gate down there is as far in as you d get  you re
coming into a little slice of space and or time that s been carved out to protect talented kids from exactly the kind of activities you
guys come in here to do  why orin  anyway  the kid appears four times a game  never gets hit  doesn t even wear pads  a onetrick pony  why not john wayne  a more dramatic story  geopolitics  privation  exile  drama  a better player than hal even  a
more complete game  aimed like a fucking missile at the show  maybe the top five if he doesn t fuck up or burn down  wayne s
your ideal food group  which is why we ll keep you off him as long as he s here  
the soft profiler looked around at the scalps and knees in the stands  the bags of gear and a couple incongruous cans of
furniture polish   carved out of what  though  this place

carved out of sedimentary shale and ferrous granite and generic morphic crud   at more or less the same time the hilltop s
bulge was shaved off and rolled and impacted level for tennis   are e t a  s abundant tunnels  there are access tunnels and
hallway tunnels  with rooms and labs and pump room s lung nexus off both sides  utility tunnels and storage tunnels and little
blunt off tunnels connecting tunnels to other tunnels  maybe about sixteen different tunnels in all  in a shape that s more generally
ovoid than anything else 
           h   lamont chu  josh gopnik  audern tallat kelpsa  philip traub  tim   sleepy t p    peterson  carl whale 
kieran mckenna   the bulk of the ambulatory sub    male eschatonites   plus ten year old kent blott   are    meters
directly below the hal darkness match s show court with glad handle tie       trashbags and b p  low diffusion compact
mercuric flashlights  plus chu has a clipboard with a pen attached to its clamp with twine  the sounds of competitive sneakermovement and spectatorial bleacher squeaks on the surface  travelling down through meters of compacted crud and polymerized
cement tunnel ceiling w  parget layer  sound rather like the stealthy dry scuttle of rodents  vermin  and this heightens the
excitement that s part of why they re really down here 
one part of the reason they re down here is that small u s  boys seem to have this fetish for getting down in the enclosed
fundaments underneath things   tunnels  caves  ventilator shafts  the horrific areas beneath wooden porches   rather the way
older u s  boys like great perspectival heights and spectacular views encompassing huge swaths of territory  this latter fetish
accounting for why e t a  s hilltop site is one of its trump cards in the recruiting war with port washington and other easternseaboard academies 
another part is a semi punitive shit detail in which certain players   judged to have been involved in the recent eschaton
nonstrategic combat debacle  but who are uninjured       and not in the much severer hot water that the big buddies on the
scene are in   have been punitively remanded below ground in p m  shifts on what s supposed to constitute an unpleasant chore 
to scout out the tunnelled route the testar ail weather inflatable structures corp  s professional guys will have to take as they
haul out from the lung storage room the fiberglass struts and crosspieces and dendri urethane folds that compose the lung  for
erection of the lung  when the e t a  administration finally decides that the late fall weather has gone beyond character building

 and become an impediment to development and morale  this will be soon  because the prorectors live in rooms off the larger
tunnels and f  d  v  harde s physical plant and maintenance guys have their offices and supplies down here  and because dr 
james incandenza s old optics and editing facilities are down here off one of the main tunnels and get used for leith ogilvie
classes in entertainment production and for optical science tutorials etc   and because a couple of the secondary and off tunnels are
used for temporary storage by departing seniors who can t tote eight or more years  worth of accumulated stuff in one postgraduate load   especially if they jet off to some novitiate pro satellite circuit for the summer  because that means air travel  two
bags plus gear  max   some of the tunnels become badly littered in the warm season with trash type material  and sometimes
there s bulky possession type overflow from the little curved storage tunnels off the prorectors  hallway  smaller kids are perfect
for recons into low narrow tunnels partly blocked with dross  and even though it s no secret around e t a  that the smaller boys
spend a fair amount of time down in the tunnels anyway  a retributive aspect is lent to this recon detail by making the kids take
down handle tie trashbags to clear away littered exam papers and lab handouts  calculator batteries and banana peels and kodiak
smokeless tobacco tins and spirals of synthetic gut racquet string  and maintenance guys  hideous cigar butts   sleepy t p  finds
two bright trojan wrappers just off the prorectors  hallway tunnel  and then a couple meters farther along the floor the vermiform
gleam of an actual condom  and there s some high register debate about whether it s a used condom or not  and poor old kent
blott is finally put in charge of picking it up and putting it in a trashbag  just in case it s a used condom   and empty boxes of
complimentary corporate gear  and full boxes of faggy or poorly absorbent gear nobody wants  and habitant can wrappers  and
senior trunks and dorm sized fridgelettes  etc   and also to move whatever boxes they can heft  clear them out of the testar guys 
access route into the lung storage and pump rooms  and lamont chu is supposed to note the location of any boxes or objects
too bulky for them to move out of the way  and beefy custodial guys will be dispatched to handle them as they see fit 
this is why a fair number of the smaller e t a  males don t see stice take a set off hal incandenza and nearly beat him  is that
they were remanded down here by neil hartigan right after post conditioning showers 
as noted already  they don t much mind it  being down here  now in one of the child size diametered off tunnels between the
prorectors  hallway and the lung storage room  the eschatonites are down here quite a lot anyway  in fact the sub    e t a s
historically have a kind of tunnel club  like many small boys  clubs  the tunnel club s unifying raison d etre is kind of vague 
tunnel club activities mostly involve congregating informally in the better lit main tunnels and hanging out and catching each
other in lies about their lives and careers before e t a   and recapitulating the most recent eschaton  usually only about five a
term   and the club s only formal activity is sitting around with a yellowed copy of robert s rules endlessly refining and
amending the rules for who can and can t join the tunnel club  a true boy type club  the tunnel club s least vague raison d etre
has to do with exclusion  the vital no girls exclusion is the only ironclad part of the tunnel club s charter        with the
exception of kent blott  every boy down here on this detail is an eschatonite and a member of the tunnel club  kent blott 
ineligible for eschaton because he s a humanities type kid and hasn t even taken quadrivial algebra yet  and excluded from the
club under every incarnation of the eligibility requirements thus far  is down here solely because he was heard to maintain at
lunch that he was in the north part of the main tunnel between the comm  ad  locker rooms and the subterranean laundry room
this a m   short cutting back to his room in west house after drills and a sauna  and claimed to have espied   scuttling out of his
mercuric light toward one of the secondary tunnels to subdorms c and d and the east courts and this same general tunnel area
they re now in   to have sighted what was either a rat or  he said  what looked even more like a concavitated feral hamster  so
the es chatonites are also enthusiastic to be down here for potential rodent recon  checking out blott s claim  and they ve brought
what s either a very nervous or very excited blott down with them  so they can trace the possible routes blott said he saw the
rodent maybe take  filling their glad handle ties and noting heavy items along the way  and also so they can immediately
encircle and discipline kent blott if it turns out he was yanking people s chains  plus they make blott be the one to take full
trashbags and tie their plastic handles together and drag them back to where the expedition started   the entrance to the large
smooth main tunnel by the boys  sauna   since none of them enjoys dragging full trashbags solo through dark tunnels with the
rodential squeaking of match play and spectation far above  chu holds a penlight in his teeth and writes heavy stuff down  they ve
filled several bags and gotten the lighter shit stacked off back enough to create a narrow route almost all the way to the pump
room  around which room hangs a strange sweet stale burny smell that none of them can place  the applause as hal incandenza
barely takes the first set above sounds down here like faraway rain  the off tunnel s dark as a pocket  but warm and dry  and
there s surprisingly little dust  ducts and coaxials running along the low ceiling make whale and tallat kelpsa have to crouch as
they walk point  clearing boxes and trying unsuccessfully to move fridgelettes back out of the way  there are several pockets of
small but heavy dorm size maytag fridgelettes  the kind of thing no graduate takes with him  panelled in dark wood grain plastic 
some of them old models with three prong plugs instead of chargers  some of the empty fridgelettes have been indifferently
scrubbed out and have their doors partway open and smell stale  most of chu s inventory for beefy adult removal are either
fridgelettes or locked trunks full of what sound like magazines and eight year accumulations of pennies  the muffled rodential
squeak of sneakers far overhead excites the tunnel club boys and puts them on edge  philip traub keeps making little squeaky
noises and secretly tickling the back of people s necks  causing enormous excitement and much stopping and starting and tightlyenclosed whirling around  until kieran mckenna captures traub tickling josh gopnik in the bright beam of his p b  light and
gopnik punches traub in the radial nerve  and traub clutches his arm and weeps and says he s quitting and going topside  
traub s the youngest kid here except for blott and is a probationary second string launcher in most eschatons   and they have to
stop and let chu note and mark two discarded fridgelettes while peterson and gopnik try to distract and amuse traub into staying
and not retreating back up to nwangi and making a high pitched stink 
discarded fridgelettes  empty boxes  immovable and complexly address labelled trunks  used athletic tape and ace bandages 
the occasional empty visine bottle  which blott stashes in his sweatshirt pouch  for mike pemulis s next contest   optics i   ii lab
reports  broken ball machines and stray tennis balls too dead even for the repressurization machine  broken or discarded tp
cartridges of stroke analysis filmings or worn out entertainments  an anomalous set of parfait glasses  fruit peels and aminopal
energy bar wrappers that the club itself had left down here after meetings  discarded curls of grip and tensile string  several
incongruous barrettes  several old broadcast televisions some older kids used to like to keep around to watch the static  and  along
the seam of wall and floor  brittle limb shaped husks of exfoliated pledge  expanses of arm and leg already half decayed into

 fragrant dust   this comprising the bulk of the crud down here  and the kids don t much mind scanning and inventorying and
bagging it  because their minds are diverted by something else very exciting  a kind of possible raison d etre for the club itself 
unless blott had been tweaking their units  in which case look out blott  is the consensus 
gopnik to a sniffling traub  while peterson shines his flashlight on the clipboard for chu   mary had a little lamb  its fleece
electrostatic   and everywhere that mary went  the lights became erratic  
carl whale pretends to be immensely fat and moves along the wall with a blimpish splay legged waddle 
peterson to traub  while gopnik holds the light   eighteen year old top ranked john wayne   had sex with herr schtitt on a
train   they had sex again and again and again and again and again and again   which the slightly older kids find more
entertaining than traub does 
kent blott asks why a wispy dicked blubberer like phil gets to be in the tunnel club while his own applications get turned
down  and tallat kelpsa cuts him short by doing something to him in the dark that makes blott shriek 
it s utterly dark except for the dime sized discs of their low diffusion b p s  because they ve left the tunnels  strings of bare
overhead bulbs off  because gopnik  who s originally from brooklyn and knows from rodents  says only a complete booger eating
moron would do rat reconnaissance in the light  and it seems reasonable to assume that feral hamsters  also  have a basically ratty
attitude toward light 
chu has blott see whether he can lift a bulky old doorless microwave oven that s lying on its side up next to one wall  and
blott tries and barely lifts it  and pules  and chu marks the oven down for the adults to lift and tells blott to drop it  which
invitation blott takes literally  and the crash and tinkle infuriate gopnik and mckenna  who say that scanning for rodents with
blott is like fly fishing with an epileptic  which cheers traub up quite a bit 
feral hamsters   bogey wise right up there with mile high toddlers  skull deprived wraiths  carnivorous flora  and marsh gas
that melts your face off and leaves you with exposed gray and red facial musculature for the rest of your ghoulish pariah life  in
terms of late night hair raising concavity narratives   are rarely sighted south of the lucite walls and ath scme d checkpoints
that delimit the great concavity  and only once in a blue moon anywhere south of like the new border burg of methuen ma 
whose chamber of commerce calls it  the city that interdependence rebuilt   and anyway pace blott are hardly ever seen solo 
being the sort of rapacious locust like mass movement creature that canadian agronomists call  piranha of the plains   an
infestation of feral hamsters in the waste rich terrain of metro boston  to say nothing of the clutter tunnelled e t a  grounds 
would be an almost grand scale public health disaster  would cause simply no end of adult running in circles and knuckle biting 
and would consume megacalories of displaced pre adolescent stress for the e t a  players  every ear cocked eye peeled bagtoting kid in the off tunnel this afternoon is hoping hamster in a big way  except for kent blott  who s hoping simply and fervently
for some sort of rodential sighting or scat sample that ll keep him from being disciplinarily hung upside down in a lavatory stall to
shriek until a staff member finds him  he reminds the tunnel clubbers that it s not like he d claimed he espied the thing actually
heading in this direction  he d only seen the thing scuttling in a way that seemed to suggest a tendency or like probability of
heading in this direction 
one whole box on its side with its frayed strapping tape split has spilled part of a load of old tp cartridges  old and mostly
unlabelled  out onto the tunnel floor in a fannish pattern  and gopnik and peterson complain that the cartridge cases  sharp edges
put holes in their glad bags  and blott is dispatched with three bags of cartridges and fruit rinds  each only about half full  back to
the lit vestibule outside the comm  ad  tunnel s start  where a serious pile of bags is starting to pile fragrantly up 
plus a confirmed feral hamster sighting  chu and gopnik and  s t p  
peterson have agreed  could well distract the headmaster s office from post eschaton reprisals against big buddies pemulis 
incandenza and axford  whom the club s eschatonite faction doesn t want to see reprised against  particularly  though the
consensus is nobody would much mind seeing the malefic ann kittenplan hung out to dry in a serious way  plus hamsterincursions could be posited to account for the occult appearance of large and incongruous e t a  objects in inappropriate places 
which started in august with the thousands of practice balls found scattered all over the blue lobby carpeting and the carefully
arranged pyramid of aminopal energy bars found on court   at dawn drills in mid september and has gained momentum in a way
no one cares for one bit   feral hamsters being notorious draggers and rearrangers of stuff they can t eat but feel compelled to
fuck with anyway  somehow   and so ease the communal near hysteria the objects have caused among aboriginal blue collar
staff and sub    e t a  alike  which would make the tunnel club guys something like heroes  fore seeably 
they move along the tunnel  their mercuric lights xing and separating and forming jagged angles  colored faintly pink 
but even a confirmed rat would be a coup  dean of academic affairs mrs  inc has a violent phobic thing about vermin and
waste and insects and overall facility hygiene  and orkin men with beer bellies and playing cards with naked girls in high heeled
shoes on the backs  mckenna s claim  spray the bejeesus out of the e t a  grounds twice a semester  none of the younger e t a 
boys   who have the same post latency fetish for vermin they have about subterranean access and exclusive clubs   none of
them has ever once gotten to see or trap a rat or roach or even so much as a lousy silverfish anyplace around here  so the unspoken
consensus is that a ham ster d be optimal but they d settle for a rat  just one lousy rat could give the whole club a legit raison  an
explicable reason for congregating underground   all of them are a bit uneasy about liking to congregate underground for no
good or clear reason 
 sleeps  you think you could lift that and carry it  
 chu man i wouldn t even get up next to whatever that is much less touch it  
blott s footfalls and tuneless whistling can be heard from far away  returning  and the distant squeak of overhead sneakers 
gopnik stops and his light pans  playing on faces   ok  somebody farted  
 what s this up next to it  sleeps   chu backing up to widen his light s beam on something broad and squat and dark 
 could i get some lights over here on this you guys  
 because did somebody go ahead and cut one in this little unventilated space  
 chu  it s a room fridge  that s all  
 but it s bigger than the room fridges  
 but it s not as big as a real fridge  

  it s in between  
 i do smell something  though  gop  i admit  
 there is a smell  if somebody farted  speak up  
 otherwise it s a smell  
 don t try to describe it  
 sleeps  that s no human fart i ve ever smelled  
 it s too powerful for a fart  
 maybe teddy schacht was having an attack and staggered down here just to cut one  
peterson trains his light on the midsized brown fridge   you don t possibly think chu says  no way  no way  
 what  blott says 
 don t even think it   chu says 
 i don t even think any kind of mammal could fart that bad  chu  
peterson s looking at chu  both of their faces pale in the mercuric light   no way somebody d graduate and leave and put their
fridge down here without taking the food out  
blott goes  is that the smell  
 was this pearson s fridge last year  
sleepy t p  turns around   who smells a  like  a like decay element  
lights on the tunnel ceiling from upraised hands 
 quorum on decay type odor  
 should we check   chu says   blott s hamster might be in there  
 gnawing on something unspeakable  maybe  
 you mean open it  
 pearson had a bigger than usual fridge  
 open it  
chu scratches behind his ear   me and gop    light it up  peterson opens it  
 why me  
 you re closest  sleeps  hold your breath  
 jesus  well back off up here so i can jump way back if anything like flies out  
 nobody could be so low  who would go off and leave a full fridge  
 happy to back way  way off   says carl whale  his light receding 
 not even pearson could be that low  leaving food in an unplugged fridge  
 this could explain rodent attraction and then some  
 now look out     ready      hummph  
 ow  get off  
 put the light ov  oh my god    eeeeeeeyu    hhhhwwwww    oh my god    bllaaaaarrr  
 such a smell i m smelling  
 there s mayonnaise  he left mayonnaise in there    why the bulge in the top of the lid    the ballooning carton of orange
juice    nothing could live in that  rodent or otherwise    so why s that sandwich meat moving    maggots    maggots  
 shut it  sleeps  kick it shut  
 this right here is exactly as close as i m ever getting to that fridge ever again  chu  
 the smell s expanding  
 i can smell it from here    whale s tiny distant voice 
 i m not enjoying this at all  
 this is death  woe unto those that gazeth on death  the bible  
 what re maggots  
 should we just run really fast the other way  
 second that  
 this is probably what the rat or hamster smelled   blott ventures 
 run  
high receding voices  bobbing lights  whale s light way out front 
after stice and incandenza split the first two sets and hal dashed into the locker room at the break to put collyrium brand
eyewash in eyes that were bothering him and delint made warped crashing sounds on the tiers as he walked down the bleachers
and over to have a word with stice  who was squatting against the net post holding his left arm up like a scrubbed surgeon and
applying a towel to the arm  delint s place up next to helen steeply was taken by female prorector thierry poutrincourt  freshly
showered  long faced  a non u s  citizen  a tall quebecer former satellite pro in rimless specs and a violetish ski cap just enough
of a shade away from the journalist s hat to make the people behind them pretend to shield their eyes from the clash  the putative
newshound introduced herself and asked poutrincourt who the heavy browed kid was at the end of the top bleacher behind them 
hunched over and gesturing and speaking into his empty fist 
 james troeltsch of philadelphia is better to leave alone to play the broadcaster to himself  he is a strange and unhappy  
poutrincourt said  her face long and cavern cheeked and not terribly happy looking itself  her slight shrugs and way of looking
elsewhere while speaking were not unlike remy marathe s   when we hear you are the journalist for shiny perfumed magazines of
fad and trend we are told be unfriendly  but me  i think i am friendly   her smile was rictal and showed confused teeth   my
family s loved ones also are large of size  it is difficult to be large  
steeply s pre assignment decision was to let all size references pass as if there was some ability to screen out any reference to
size or girth  originating possibly in adolescence   your mr  delint certainly held himself aloof  
 delint  when we prorectors are suggested to do a thing  he asks to himself only  how can i perfectly do this thing so the

 superiors will smile with pleasure at delint   poutrincourt s right forearm was almost twice the size of her left  she wore white
sneakers and a donnay warmup of a deep glowing neutron blue that clashed hideously with both their caps  the circles beneath
her eyes were also blue 
 why the instructions to be unfriendly  
poutrincourt always nodded for a while before she replied to anything  as if things had to go through various translationcircuits  she nodded and scratched at her long jaw  thinking   you are here to make publicity a child player  one of our
etoiles        and dr  tavis  he is how you say quantified    
 quarantined  suspicious  guarded  
 no     
 confused  torn  in a quandary  
 quandary is how  because this is a good place  and hal is good  better since before the present  perhaps now he is etoile   a
shrug  long arms akimbo  hal reemerged from comm  ad  and  ankle brace or no  displayed a slow loose thoroughbred trot past
the pavilion and bleachers and to the gate in  i   s southern fence  acting as if unwatched by people in bleachers  and tapped two
of his big headed tennis racquets together to listen for the strings  pitch  exchanging some neutral words with delint  who was
standing with stice at the edge of the transom s shadow  stice breaking into a half laugh at something  twirling his racquet and
walking back to serve as hal retrieved a ball along the north fence  both players  racquets had large heads and thick frames 
thierry poutrincourt said  and by nature who does not wish the shiny attention  that the magazines with cologne on their pages
say this is etoile  enfield tennis academy it is good  
 i m here to do a soft inoffensive profile on his brother  with hal mentioned only as part of an american family exceptional in
several respects  i don t see what s quandariacal for dr  tavis about this   the tiny plump officious man who seemed to have a
phone tucked under his chin at all times  the kind of frenzied over cooperation that s a technical interviewer s worst nightmare for
an interrogation  the little man s monologue had done to steeply s brain kind of what a flashbulb does to your eyes  and if he d
explicitly denied him access to the brother then the denial had been slipped in after he d worn steeply down 
there was the slight shaken saw wobble of bleachers as delint walked back up  stacked charts against his chest like a
schoolgirl s books  his smile at the quebecois player in his seat as if he d never met her before  settling in heavily on steeply s
other side  glancing down at where the profiler d bracketed notes on the possible sounds a string hit ball sounds like in cold air 
cut  king  ping  pons  pock  cop  thwa  thwat 
the samizdat entertainment s director s other son chipped a return that caught the tape and sat there a moment and fell back 
 veux que nous nous parlons en fran ais  serait plus facile   a   this invitation because poutrincourt s eyes had gone hooded
the minute the de lint person joined them 
poutrincourt s shrug was blase  francophones are never impressed that anyone else can speak french   very well then look  
she said  poutrincourt did  in quebecois    pubescent stars are nothing new to this sport  lenglen  rosewall  in a d       a fifteenyear old girl won wimbledon  she was the first  evert in the semifinals of the us open at sixteen      or     austin  jaeger  graff 
sawamatsu  venus williams  borg  wilander  chang  treffert  med vedev  esconja  becker of the a d    os  now this new
argentinean kleckner  
steeply lit a flanderfume that made delint s face spread with distaste   you compare it is like gymnastics  figure skating 
competitive to swim  
poutrincourt made no comment on steeply s syntax   just so  then  good  
steeply was adjusting the long peasant skirt and crossing legs so he was inclined away from delint  gazing at a kind of
translucent mole on poutrincourt s long cheek  poutrincourt s thick rimless specs were like a scary nun s  she looked more male
than anything  long and hard and breastless  steeply tried to exhale away from everyone   the world plateau tennis not being
required to have neither the size and muscle of the hockey nor the basketball nor the american football  for example  
poutrincourt nodded   but yes  nor the millimetric precision of your baseball s hitting  nor how the italians say the senza
errori  the never miss consistency  that keeps the golfers from true mastery until they have thirty or more years   the prorector
switched for just a moment to english  possibly for delint s benefit   your french is parisian but possible  me  mine is
quebecois  
steeply now got to give that same sour gallic shrug   you re saying to me serious tennis doesn t need of an athlete anything
already adolescents do not possess  if they are exceptional for it  
 the medicinists of sports science know well what top tennis requires   poutrincourt said  back in french   too well  which are
the agility  the reflexes        the short range speed  the balance  some coordination between the hand and the eye  and very
much endurance  some strength  with particular importance for the male  but all these are achievable by the period of puberty  for
some  but yes  but wait   she said  putting a hand on the notebook as steeply started to pretend to inscribe   the thing you have put
as the question to me  this is why the quandary  the young players  they have the advantage in psyche  also  
 the edge of mentality   steeply said  trying to ignore the boy speaking into his hand several seats over  delint seemed to be
ignoring everything around him  engrossed in the match and his statistics  the canadian prorec tor s hands moved in small circles
out front to indicate engagement in the conversation  americans  conversational hands sit like lumps of dough most of the time 
remy marathe had pointed out once 
 but yes  so  the formidable mental edge that their psyches are still not yet adult in all ways   therefore  so  they do not feel
the anxiety and pressure in the way it is felt by adult players  this is every story of the teenager appearing from no location to
upset the famous adult in professional play   the ephebic  they do not feel the pressure  they can play with abandon  they are
without fear   a cold smile  sunlight blazed on her lenses   at the beginning  at the beginning they are without pressure or fear 
and they burst from seemingly no location onto the professional stage  instant etoiles  phenomenal  fearless  immunized to
pressure  numb to anxiety   at first  they seem as if they are like the adult players only better   better in emotion  more
abandoned  not human to the stress or fatigue or the airplaning without end  to the publicity  
 the english expression of the child in the store of candy  
 seemingly unfeeling of the loneliness and alienation and everyone wants a thing from the etoile  

  the money  also  
 but it is soon you start to see the burning out which the place like ours is hoping to prevent  you remember jaeger  burned
out at sixteen  austin at twenty  arias and krickstein  esconja and treffert  too injured to play on by their late teenage years  the
much promising capriati  the well known tragedy  pat cash of australia  fourth on earth at eighteen  vanished by the twenties of
age  
 not to be mentioning the large money  the endorsings and appearings  
 always so  for the young etoile  and now worse in today  that the sponsors have no broadcasting to advertise with  now the
ephebe who is famous etoile  who is in magazines and the sports reports aux disques  he is pursued to become the billboard who
walks  use this  wear this  for money  millions thrown at you before you can drive the cars you buy  the head swells to the size
of a balloon  why not  
 but can pressure be far behind the back   steeply said 
 many times the same  winning two and three upset matches  feeling suddenly so loved  so many talking to you as if there is
love  but always the same  then  for then you awaken to the fact that you are loved for winning only  the two and three wins
created you  for people  it is not that the wins made them recognize something that existed unrecognized before these upset wins 
the from noplace winning created you  you must keep winning to keep the existence of love and endorsements and the shiny
magazines wanting your profile  
 enter the pressure   steeply said 
 pressure such as one could not imagine  now that to maintain you must win  now that winning is the expected  and all alone 
in the hotels and the airplanes  with any other player you could speak to of the pressure to exist wanting to beat you  wanting to be
exist above and not below  or the others  wanting from you  and only so long as you play with abandon  winning  
 hence the suicides  the burn out  the drugs  the self indulging  the spoilage  
 what is the instruction if we shape the ephebe into the athlete who can win fearlessly to be loved  yet we do not prepare her
for the time after fear comes  no  
 therefore the terrible pressure here  they are being tempered  oven toughened  
hal served wide and this time followed it in  the serve  taking a stutter step at the service line  slice s body seemed to elongate
as he reached and got the stick up over the return  driving a forehand  hal volleyed it too short and took a couple steps off the net
as stice came in  winding up for an easy pass  hal guessed a direction and started to his left  and the darkness chipped a lob right
over him and hit the heel of his hand against his strings as hal gave it up halfway back  stice not rubbing it in but exhorting
himself  hal s sweat was way heavier than the kansan s  but slice s face was almost maroon with flush  each player twirled his
stick in his hand as hal walked back to retrieve the ball  stice took his position in the deuce court  pulling up his socks 
 still smart for hal to follow the serve in once a game or so   delint said into steeply s ear 
and irritating throughout was the heavy browed red nostriled kid james troeltsch at the very end of the top bleacher 
speaking into his fist  coming at the fist from first one angle and then another  pretending to be two people 
 incandenza the controller  incandenza the tactician 
 rare tactical lapse for incandenza  following the serve in when he s just finally started establishing control from the baseline 
 have a look at incandenza standing there waiting for ortho stice to finish futzing with his socks so he can serve  the
resemblance to statues of augustus of rome  the regal bearing  the set of the head  the face impassive and emanating command 
the chilly blue eyes 
 the chilly reptilian film of concentration in the cold blue eyes  jim 
 the halster s been having some trouble controlling his volleys 
 personally  jim  i think he d be better off with his old midsized graphite stick than that large head the creepy dunlop guy got
him to switch to 
 stice being the younger player out there  he s grown up with the extra large head  a large head is all the darkness knows 
 you could say stice was born with a large head  and that incandenza s a man who s adapted his game to a large head 
 hal s career dating back to before your polycarbonate resins changed the whole power matrix of the junior game  too  jim 
 and what a day for tennis 
 what a day for family fun of all kinds 
this bud s for the whole family  it s the bud match of the week  brought to you 
 incandenza even reported to have modified his grip  all to accommodate the large head 
 and by the multiphasix family of fine graphite reinforced polycarbonate resins  ray 
 jim  ortho stice   impossible to even visualize stice without his trusty large head 
 it s all they know  these kids  
delint hiked back onto an elbow on the tier above and told james troeltsch to regulate the volume or he was going to take a
personal interest in seeing troeltsch suffer 
hal bounced the ball three times  tossed  rocked farther back on the toss  and absolutely crunched the serve  spinless and
wickedly angled out wide  stice grotesquely off balance  lunging too far and hitting the backhand cramped  down the line and
shallow  hal moved in to the service line for it  hunched and with his stick cocked up behind him  looking somehow insec tile 
stice stood in the middle of the baseline awaiting pace and was helpless when hal shortened the stroke and dribbled it at an angle
cross court  barely clearing the net and distorted with backspin and falling into the half meter of fair space the acuteness of the
angle allowed 
 hal incandenza has the greater tennis brain   poutrincourt said in english 
hal aced stice down the center to go up either     or     in the third 
 the thing you want to know about hal  babe  is he s got a complete game   delint said as the boys changed ends of the court 
stice holding two balls out before him on the face of his racquet  hal went to the towel again  the children along the bottom tier
were leaning left and then right in tandem  amusing themselves  the apparition with the lens and metal pole was gone  overhead 
 what you want to know  watching juniors at this level   delint says  still back on an elbow so his upper body was out of sight

 and he was just legs and a voice in steeply s cold ear   they all have different strengths  areas of the game they re better at  and
you can drown in profiling a match or a player in terms of the different strengths and the number of individual strengths  
 i am not here to profile the boy   steeply said  but in french again 
delint ignored him   it s not just the strengths or the number of strengths  it s do they come together to make a game  how
complete is a kid  has he got a game  those kids at lunch you got to meet  
 but not speak to  
 the kid in the idiotic hat  pemulis  mike s got great  great volleys  he s a natural at net  great  great hand eye  mike s other
strength is he s got the best lob in east coast juniors bar none  these are his strengths  the reason both of these kids you re
looking at out here right now can beat the living shit out of pemulis is pemulis s strengths don t give him a complete game 
volleys re an offensive shot  a lob s a baseliner s weapon  counterpuncher  you can t lob from the net or volley from the baseline  
 he says michael pemulis s abilities cancel each other out         poutrin court said in the other ear 
delint made the small salaam of iteration   pemulis s strengths cancel each other out  now todd possalthwaite  the littler kid
with the bandage on his nose from the soap and shower slipping thing  possalthwaite s also got a great lob  and while pemulis d
take him right now on pure age and power possalthwaite s the technically superior player with the better future  because todd s
built a complete game out of his lob  
 this delint is wrong   poutrincourt said in quebecois  smiling rictally across steeply at delint 
 because possalthwaite won t come in to net  possalthwaite hangs back at any cost  and unlike pemulis he works to develop
the groundstrokes to let him stay back and draw the other guy in and use that venomous lob  
 which means at fourteen his game  it will never change or grow  and if he grows strong and wishes to attack he will never be
able   poutrincourt said 
delint displayed so little curiosity about what poutrincourt inserted that steeply wondered if he had some french on the sly 
and made a private ideogram to this effect   possalthwaite s a pure defensive strategist  he s got a gestalt  the term we use here for
a complete game is either gestalt or complete game  
stice aced hal out wide on the ad court again  and the ball got stuck in an intersticial diamond in the chain link fencing  and
hal had to put his stick down and use both hands to force the thing out 
 maybe for your article  though  the poop on this kid  the punter s brother   hal can t lob half as good as even possalthwaite 
and compared to ortho or mike his net play s pedestrian  but unlike his brother when he was here  see  hal s strengths have
started to fit together  he s got a great serve  a great return of serve  and great  great groundstrokes  with great control and great
touch  great command of touch and spin  and he can take a defensive player and yank the kid around with his superior control  and
he can take an attacking player and use the guy s own pace against him  
hal passed stice off the backhand down the line and the ball looked sure to land fair  and then at the last possible second it
veered out  an abrupt tight curve out of bounds as if some freak gust came out of nowhere and blew it out  and stice looked more
surprised than hal did  the punter s brother s face registered nothing as he stood at the ad corner  adjusting something on his
strings 
 but perhaps one does attain this  to win  imagine you  you become just what you have given your life to be  not merely very
good but the best  the good philosophy of here and schtitt   i believe this philosophy of enfield is more canadian than
american  so you may see i have prejudice   is that you must have also   so  leave to one side for a moment the talent and work
to become best   that you are doomed       if you do not have also within you some ability to transcend the goal  transcend the
success of the best  if you get to there  
steeply could see  off in the parking lot behind the hideous bulging neo georgian cube of the community and administration
building  several small boys carrying and dragging white plastic bags to the nest of dumpsters that abutted the pines at the parking
lot s rear  the children pale and wild eyed and conferring among themselves and casting anxious looks across the grounds at the
crowd behind the show court 
 then   poutrincourt said   and for the ones who do become the etoiles  the lucky who become profiled and photographed for
readers and in the u s a  religion make it  they must have something built into them along the path that will let them transcend it 
or they are doomed  we see this in experience  one sees this in all obsessive goal based cultures of pursuit  look at the japonois 
the suicide rates of their later years  this task of us at the enfield is more delicate still  with the etoiles  for  you  if you attain your
goal and cannot find some way to transcend the experience of having that goal be your entire existence  your raison de
faire        so  then  one of two things we see will happen  
steeply had to keep breathing on the pen to keep the point thawed 
 one  one is that you attain the goal and realize the shocking realization that attaining the goal does not complete or redeem
you  does not make everything for your life  ok  as you are  in the culture  educated to assume it will do this  the goal  and then
you face this fact that what you had thought would have the meaning does not have the meaning when you get it  and you are
impaled by shock  we see suicides in history by people at these pinnacles  the children here are versed in what is called the saga
of eric clipperton  
 with two p s  
 just so  or the other possibility of doom  for the etoiles who attain  they attain the goal  thus  and put as much equal passion
into celebrating their attainment as they had put into pursuing the attainment  this is called here the syndrome of the endless
party  the celebrity  money  sexual behaviors  drugs and substances  the glitter  they become celebrities instead of players  and
because they are celebrities only as long as they feed the culture of goal s hunger for the make it  the winning  they are doomed 
because you cannot both celebrate and suffer  and play is always suffering  just so  
 our best boy is better than hal  you ll see him play tomorrow if you want  john wayne  no relation to the real john wayne 
a fellow compatriot of terry here   aubrey delint was sitting back up beside them  the cold giving his pitted cheeks a second
flush  two feverish harlequin ovals   john wayne s got a gestalt because wayne s simply got everything  and everything with him s
got the sort of pace that a touch artist and thinker like hal just can t handle  
 this was the founder s philosophy  too  of doom  the punter incan denza s father  who also i am being told dabbled in

 filming   steeply asked the canadian 
poutrincourt s shrug could have meant too many things to note   i came after  m  schtitt  his different goal for the etoiles is to
walk between these   nor did steeply quite notice the woman s shifts between dialects   to map out some path between needing
the success and mockery making of the success  
delint leaned in   wayne s got everything  hal s strength has become knowing he doesn t have everything  and constructing a
game as much out of what s missing as what s there  
steeply pretended to arrange the cap but was really adjusting the wig   it all sounds awfully abstract for something so
physical  
poutrincourt s shrug pushed her glasses slightly up   it is contradictory  two selves  one not there  m  schtitt  when the
academy founder died       
 the punter s father  who dabbled in films   steeply s raglan sweater had been his wife s 
again nodding blandly  poutrincourt   this academic founder  m  schtitt tells that this founder was a student of types of
sight  
delint said  wayne s only possible limits being also his strength  the tungsten steel will and resolve  the insistence on
imposing his game and his will on his man  totally unwilling to change the pace of his game if he s not doing good  wayne s got
the touch and the lobs to hang back on an off day  but he won t   if he s down or things aren t going his way  he just hits harder 
his pace is so overwhelming he can get away with being uncompromising about attack against north american juniors  but in the
show  which wayne ll go pro maybe as soon as next year  in the show flexibility is more important  he ll find  what do you call  a
humility  
poutrincourt was looking at steeply almost too carelessly  it almost seemed   the studying was not so much how one sees a
thing  but this relation between oneself and what one sees  he translated this numerously across different fields  m  schtitt tells  
the son described his father as quote  genre dysphoric  
poutrincourt cocked her head   this does not sound like hal incan denza  
delint sniffed meatily   but wayne s gestalt s chief edge over hal is the head  wayne is pure force  he doesn t feel fear  pity 
remorse   when a point s over  it might as well have never happened  for wayne  hal actually has finer groundstrokes than
wayne  and he could have wayne s pace if he wanted  but the reason wayne is three continentally and hal s six is the head  hal
looks just as perfectly dead out there  but he s more vulnerable in terms of  like  emotionally  hal remembers points  senses trends
in a match  wayne doesn t  hal s susceptible to fluctuations  discouragement  set long lapses in concentration  some days you
can almost see hal like flit in and out of a match  like some part of him leaves and hovers and then comes back  
the troeltsch person said  holy crow  
 so to survive here for later is  finally  to have it both ways   thierry poutrincourt said quietly  in nearly accentless english  as
if to herself 
 this emotional susceptibility in terms of forgetting being more commonly a female thing  schtitt and i think it s a will issue 
susceptible wills are more common to the top girls here  we see it in longley  we see it in millie kent and frannie unwin  we
don t see this forgetful will in the vaughts  or in spodek  who you can watch if you want  
the troeltsch person said  could we see that again  ray  do you think  
steeply was looking at the side of poutrincourt s face as delint on the other side was saying  but the one we see this most in
is hal  

   november year of the depend adult undergarment
the man o  war grille on prospect  matty sat in the hot clatter of the portuguese restaurant with his hands in his lap  looking
at nothing  a waiter brought his soup  the waiter had bits of either bloodstain or soup on his apron  and for no discernible reason
wore a fez  matty ate his soup without once slurping  he d been the neat eater in the family  matty pemulis was a prostitute and
today he was twenty three 
the man o  war grille is on prospect street in cambridge and its front windows overlook the heavy foot traffic between
inman and central squares  as matty waited for his soup he d seen across the restaurant and out the front s glass a bag lady type
older female in several clothing layers lift her skirts and lower herself to the pavement and move her scaggly old bowels right
there in full view of passersby and diners both  then gather all her plastic shopping bags together and walk stolidly out of view 
the pile of bowel movement sat there on the pavement  steaming slightly  matty d heard the college kids at the next table say they
didn t know whether to be totally illed or totally awed 
a big rangy kid  with a big sharp face and tight short hair and a smile and a shave twice jaw since he was fourteen  now
balding smoothly back from a high clear forehead  a permanent smile that always seemed like he was trying not to but just
couldn t help it  his da always formerly saying to wipe it off 
inman square  little lisbon  the soup has bits of calamari that make the muscles in his face flex  chewing 
now two brazilians in bell bottoms and tall shoes along the sidewalk across the window over the diners  heads  what might be
a brewing street fight  one walking forward and one walking backward  facing off as they move  each missing the dollop of
bowel movement on the walk  speaking high volume street portuguese muffled by windows and hot clatter  but each looking
around and then pointing at his own chest like   you saying this shit to me   then the forward man s sudden charge carrying them
both past the window s right frame 
matty s da d come over on a boat from louth in lenster in       matty d been three or four  da d worked on the southie
docks  coiling lengths of rope as big around as phone poles into tall cones  and had died when matty was seventeen  of pancreatic
complaints 
matty looked up from the roll he was dipping in the soup and saw two underweight interracial girls moving across the
window  one a nigger  neither even looking at the shit everyone s stepping around  and then a few seconds behind them poor tony
krause  who because of the trousers and cap matty didn t even recognize as poor tony krause until he d looked back down and

 then up again  poor tony krause looked godawful  sucked out  hollow eyed  past ill  grave ready  his face s skin the greenish
white of extreme depth marine life  looking less alive than undead  identifiable as poor old poor tony only by the boa and red
leather coat and the certain way he held his hand to his throat s hollow as he walked  that way equus reese always said always
reminded him of black and white era starlets descending curved stairs into some black tie function  krause never so much
walking as making an infinite series of grand entrances into pocket after pocket of space  a queenly hauteur now both sickening
and awesome given krause s spectral mien  passing across the grille s window  his eyes either on or looking right through the two
skinny girls plodding ahead of him  following them out of the window s right hand side 
his da d begun fucking matty up the ass when matty was ten  a fook in t boom  matty had complete recall of the whole
thing  he d seen sometimes where persons that had unpleasant things happen to them as children blocked the unpleasantness out in
their mentality as adults and forgot it  not so with matty pemulis  he remembered every inch and pimple of every single time  his
father outside the little room matt and micky slept in  late at night  the cat s eye sliver of lit hallway through the crack in the door
da d opened  the door on well oiled hinges opening with the implacable slowness of a rising moon  da s shadow lengthening
across the floor and then the man his very self weaving in behind it  crossing the moonlit floor in darned socks and that smell
about him that later matty d know was malt liquor but at that age he and mickey called something else  when they smelled it 
matty lay and pretended to sleep  he didn t know why tonight he pretended not to know the man was there  he was afraid  even
the first time  micky just five  all the times were the same  da drunk  tacking across the bedroom floor  a certain stealth 
managing somehow never to break his neck on the toy trucks and tiny cars scattered on the floor  left there that first time by
accident  sitting on the edge of the bed so his weight changed the bed s angle  a big man smelling of tobacco and something else 
his breath always audible when drunk  sitting on the edge of the bed  shaking matty  awake  to the point where matty d have to
pretend to wake up  asking if he d been asleep  sleeping  there  was he  tenderness  caresses that were somehow just over the line
from true ethnic irish fatherly affection  the emotional largesse of a man without a green card who daily broke his back for his
family s food  caresses that were in some vague way just over the line from that and from the emotional largesse of something
else  drunk  when all the rules of mood were suspended and you never knew from minute to minute whether you were to be kissed
or hit   impossible to say how or even know how they were just over those lines  but they were  the caresses  tenderness 
caresses  low soft oversweet hot bad breath  soft apologies for some flash of savagery or discipline from the day  a way of
cupping the pillow warm cheek and jaw in the hollow of the hand  the huge pinkie finger tracing the hollow between throat and
jaw  matty d shrink away  shy are we sone scared are we  matty d shrink away even after he knew the shrinking fear was part of
what brought it on  for da d get angry  who are we scared of  then  then who are we  a sone  to be scared so of our own da  as if
the da that broke daily his back were nothing more than a  can t a da show his son some love without being taken for a  as if
matty could lie here with his food inside him under bedding he d paid for and think his da were no better than a  is it a fookin
you re scared of  then  you think a da what comes in to speak to his sone and holds him as a da has nought on his mind but a
fook  as if the sone were some forty dollar whore off the docks  as if the da were a  is that what you take me for  is that what
you take me for then  matty shrinking back into a flattening pillow the da d paid for  the springs of the convertible bed singing
with his fear  he shook  why then so then i ve a mind to give you just what you re thinking t fear  take me for  matty knew early
on that his being afraid fueled the thing somehow  made his da want to  he was unable not to be afraid  he tried and tried  cursed
himself for a coward and deserving  all but calling his father a  it was years before he snapped to the fact that his da d have fooked
him in t boom no matter what he d done  that the event was laid out before the first slim line of doorlight broadened  and whatever
matty d felt or betrayed made no difference  an advantage to not blocking it out is you can snap to things later  with ma turer
perspective  you can come to see no sone on the planet could in any way ask for that  regardless  at a certain later age he started
lying there when his da shook him and pretended to sleep on  even when the shakes got to where his teeth clacked together in a
mouth that wore the slight smile matty d decided truly sleeping people s faces always wore  the harder his father shook him  the
tighter matty d shut his eyes and the more set the slight smile and the louder the rasps of the cartoon snores he alternated with
exhaled whistles  mickey over in the cot by the window always silent as a tomb  on his side  face to the wall and hidden  never a
word between them about anything more than the chances of being kissed v  hit  finally da d grab both his shoulders and flip him
over with a sound of disgust and frustration  matty thought just the smell of the fear was maybe enough to deserve it  until  later
on  he got some maturer perspective  he remembered the oval sound of the cap coming off the jar of petroleum jelly  that special
stone in pond plop of a vaseline cap  not child proof even in an era of child proof caps   hearing his da muttering as he applied
it to himself  feeling the ice cold awful cold finger between him as his da smeared the stuff roughly around matty s rosebud  his
dark star 
it was only the maturer perspective of years and experience that let matty find something to be thankful for  that the da d at
least used a lube  the origins of the big man s clear familiarity with the stuff and its nighttime use not even adult perspective could
illuminate  let matty snap to  still  now  at twenty three 
one hears  say  cirrhosis and acute pancreatitis and thinks of the subject clutching his middle like an old film s gutshot actor
and slumping quietly over to eternal rest with lids shut and face composed  matty s da d died choking on aspirated blood  a
veritable fountain of the darkest possible blood  matty coated a spray paint russet as he held the man s yellow wrists and mum
lumbered off down the ward in search of a crash cart team  particles aspirated so terribly fine  like almost atomized  so that they
hung in the air like the air itself over the cribbed bed as the man expired  cat yellow eyes wide open and face screwed into the
very most godawful rictusized grin of pain  his last thoughts  if any  unknowable  matty still toasted the man s final memory with
his first shot  whenever he indulged       

   november year of the depend adult undergarment
first thing after supper hal drops around to schtitt s room off the comm  ad  lobby to go through the motions of getting
some input on just what had gone so terribly wrong against stice  also to get maybe some kind of bead on why he d had to play
the darkness publicly in the first place  so close to the whataburger  i e  like what the exhibition might have signified  this
endless tension among e t a s about how the coaches are seeing you  gauging your progress   is your stock going up or down 

 but a  delint s the only one in there  working on some sort of oversized spreadsheetish chart  lying prone and shirtless on the bare
floor with his chin in his hand and a pungent magic marker  and says schtitt has gone off on the cycle somewhere after
confections  but to sit down  presumably meaning in a chair  so hal s subjected to several minutes of delint s take on the match 
complete with stats out of the prorector s head  delint s back is pale and constellated with red pits of old pimples  though the
back s nothing compared to struck s or shaw s back  there s a cane chair and a wood chair  delint s liquid crystal laptop screen
pulses grayly on the floor next to him  schtitt s room s overlit and there s no dust anywhere  not even in the very corners  schtitt s
sound system s lights are on but nothing s playing  neither hal nor delint mentions orin s profiler s presence in the match s
stands  nor the big lady s long interchange with poutrincourt  which had been conspicuous  stice s and wayne s names are at the
top of the huge chart on the floor  but hal s name isn t  hal says he can t tell whether he d made some sort of basic tactical error or
whether he just wasn t quite up to snuff this afternoon or what 
 you just never quite occurred out there  kid   delint apprises him  he has regressed certain figures to back this up  this
nonoccurrence  his choice of words chills hal to the root 
after which  during what s supposed to be mandatory p m  study period  and despite the three chapters of boards prep his
boards prep schedule calls for  hal sits alone up in viewing room    the bad leg out along the couch in front of him  flexing the
bad ankle idly  holding the other leg s knee to his chest  squeezing a ball but with the hand he doesn t play with  chewing kodiak
and spitting directly into an unlined wastebasket  his expression neutral  watching some cartridges of his late father s
entertainments  anyone else looking at him in there tonight would call hal depressed  he watches several cartridges all in a row 
he watches the american century as seen through a brick and pre nuptial agreement of heaven and hell and then part of
valuable coupon has been removed  which is maddening because it s all a monologue from some bespectacled little
contemporary of miles penn and heath pearson who was almost as ubiquitous as reat and bain in himself s work but whose
name right now hal can t for the life of him recall  he watches parts of death in scarsdale and union of publicly hidden in lynn
and various small flames and kinds of pain  the viewing room has insulated panelling behind the wallpaper and is essentially
soundproof  hal watches half of the  medusa v  odalisque  thing but takes it out abruptly when people in the audience start getting
turned to stone 
hal tortures himself by imagining swarthy leering types threatening to torture various loved ones if hal can t come up with
the name of the kid in valuable coupon and low temperature civics and wave bye bye to the bureaucrat 
there are two cartridges on v r    s glass shelves of himself getting interviewed in various arty community access cabletype forums  which hal declines to watch 
the lights  slight flicker and subtle change in the pressure of the room is from the e t a  furnaces kicking on way down in the
tunnels below comm  ad  hal shifts uneasily on the couch  spitting into the wastecan  the very faint smell of burnt dust is also
from the furnace 
a minor short didactic one hal likes and runs twice in a row is wave bye bye to the bureaucrat  a bureaucrat in some kind
of sterile fluorescent lit office complex is a fantastically efficient worker when awake  but he has this terrible problem waking up
in the a m   and is consistently late to work  which in a bureaucracy is idiosyncratic and disorderly and wholly unacceptable  and
we see this bureaucrat getting called in to his supervisor s pebbled glass cubicle  and the supervisor  who wears a severely dated
leisure suit with his shirt collar flaring out on either side of its rust colored lapels  tells the bureaucrat that s he s a good worker
and a fine man  but that this chronic tardiness in the a m  is simply not going to fly  and if it happens one more time the
bureaucrat is going to have to find another fluorescent lit office complex to work in  it s no accident that in a bureaucracy getting
fired is called  termination   as in ontological erasure  and the bureaucrat leaves his supervisor s cubicle duly shaken  that night he
and his wife go through their bauhaus condominium collecting every alarm clock they own  each one of which is electric and
digital and extremely precise  and they festoon their bedroom with them  so there are like a dozen timepieces with their digital
alarms all set for     h  but that night there s a power failure  and all the clocks lose an hour or just sit there blinking     h  over
and over  and the bureaucrat still oversleeps the next a m  he wakes late  lies there for a moment staring at a blinking       he
shrieks  clutches his head  throws on wrinkled clothes  ties his shoes in the elevator  shaves in the car  blasting through red lights
on the way to the commuter rail  the      train to the city pulls in to the station s lower level just as the crazed bureaucrat s car
screeches into the station s parking lot  and the bureaucrat can see the top of the train sitting there idling from across the open lot 
this is the very last temporally feasible train  if the bureaucrat misses this train he ll be late again  and terminated  he hauls into a
handicapped spot and leaves the car there at a crazy angle  vaults the turnstile  and takes the stairs down to the platform seven at a
time  sweaty and bug eyed  people scream and dive out of his way  as he careers down the long stairway he keeps his crazed eyes
on the open doors of the      train  willing them to stay open just a little longer  finally  filmed in a glacial slo mo  the bureaucrat
leaps from the seventh to the bottom step and lunges toward the train s open doors  and right in mid lunge smashes headlong into
an earnest faced little kid with thick glasses and a bow tie and those nerdy little schoolboy shorts who s tottering along the
platform under a tall armful of carefully wrapped packages  kerwham  they collide  bureaucrat and kid both stagger back from the
impact  the kid s packages go flying all over the place  the kid recovers his balance and stands there stunned  glasses and bow tie
askew        the bureaucrat looks frantically from the kid to the litter of packages to the kid to the train s doors  which are still
open  the train thrums  its interior is fluorescent lit and filled with employed  ontologically secure bureaucrats  you can hear the
station s pa announcer saying something tinny and garbled about departure  the stream of platform foot traffic opens around the
bureaucrat and the stunned boy and the litter of packages  ogilvie d once lectured for a whole period on this kid s character as an
instance of the difference between an antagonist and a deuteragonist in moral drama  he d mentioned the child actor s name over
and over  hal tries whacking himself just over the right eye several times  to dislodge the name  the film s bureaucrat s buggy
eyes keep going back and forth between the train s open doors and the little kid  who s looking steadily up at him  almost studious 
his eyes big and liquid behind the lenses  hal doesn t remember who played the bureaucrat  either  but it s the kid s name that s
driving him bats  the bureaucrat s leaning away  inclined way over toward the train doors  as if his very cells were being pulled
that way  but he keeps looking at the kid  the gifts  struggling with himself  it s a clear internal conflict moment  one of himself s
films  very few  the bureaucrat s eyes suddenly recede back into their normal places in his sockets  he turns from the fluorescent
doors and bends to the kid and asks if he s ok and says it ll all be ok  he cleans the kid s spectacles with his pocket handkerchief 

 picks the kid s packages up  about halfway through the packages the pa issues something final and the train s doors close with a
pressurized hiss  the bureaucrat gently loads the kid back up with packages  neatens them  the train pulls out  the bureaucrat
watches the train pull out  expressionless  it s anybody s guess what he s thinking  he straightens the kid s bow tie  kneeling down
the way adults do when they re ministering to a child  and tells him he s sorry about the impact and that it s ok  he turns to go 
the platform s mostly empty now  now the strange moment  the kid cranes his neck around the packages and looks up at the guy
as he starts to walk away 
 mister   the kid says   are you jesus  
 don t i wish   the ex bureaucrat says over his shoulder  walking away  as the kid shifts the packages and frees one little hand
to wave bye at the guy s topcoat s back as the camera  revealed now as mounted on the      s rear  recedes from the platform and
picks up speed 
wave bye bye to the bureaucrat remains mario s favorite of all their late father s entertainments  possibly because of its
unhip earnestness  though to mario he always maintains it s basically goo  hal secretly likes it  too  the cartridge  and likes to
project himself imaginatively into the ex bureaucrat s character on the leisurely drive home toward ontological erasure 
as a kind of weird self punishment  hal also plans to subject himself to the horrific fun with teeth and baby pictures of
famous dictators  then finally to one of himself s posthumous hits  a cartridge called blood sister  one tough nun that he d
always found kind of gratuitously nasty and overwrought  but which hal has no idea that this piece of entertainment actually
germinated out of james o  incandenza s one brief and unpleasant experience with boston aa  in the b s  mid    s  when
himself lasted two and a half months and then drifted gradually away  turned off by the simplistic god stuff and covert dogma 
bob hopeless  hal spits way more than is his norm  now  and also likes having the wastecan right nearby in case he might throw
up  that afternoon he d had zilch in the way of a kinesthetic sense  he couldn t feel the ball on his stick  his nausea has nothing to
do with watching his father s cartridges  for the last year his arm s been an extension of his mind and the stick an extension of the
arm  acutely sensitive  each of the cartridges is a carefully labelled black diskette  they re all signed neatly out on the clipboard by
the egg shaped glass bookshelf and are loaded in the cueing slots and waiting to drop  in order  and be digitally decoded

p  t  krause  n  cambridge  that infamous deceptive post seizure feeling of well being  that broken fever  reversal offortune type highhearted feeling after a neuroelectric event  poor tony krause awoke in the ambulance lizardless and continent
and feeling right as rain  lay there and flirted with the blue jawed paramedic leaning over him  certain bawdy entendres on
expressions like vital signs and dilation until the paramedic radioed ahead to cambridge city s e  room to cancel the crash cart 
manipulated his skinny arms in a parodic minimal mambo  lying there  fiddle de dee d the paramedic s warning that post seizure
feelings of well being were notoriously deceptive and transient 
and then also the little mentioned advantage to being destitute and in possession of a health card that s expired and not even
in your name  hospitals show you a kind of inverted respect  a place like cambridge city hospital bows to your will not to stay 
they all of a sudden defer to your subjective diagnostic knowledge of your own condition  which post seizure condition you feel
has turned the corner toward improvement  they bow to your quixotic will  it s unfortunately not a free hospital but it is a free
country  they honor your wishes and compliment your mambo and say go with god 
it s a good thing you can t see what you look like  though 
and the serendipity of cambridge city hospital being just an eight block stroll east on cambridge st  and then south on
prospect  through mentholated autumn air  through inman square and up to antitoi entertainment  maybe the one last place where
a renewed  post seizure  on the diagnostic upswing if still slightly shaky young gender dysphoric might yet expect a bit of
kindness  pharmacological credit  since the affairs of wo and copley library and heart 
the big brick cake of the hospital behind krause in purple twilight  the brisk click of his heels on pavement  boa semiformally loose on his shoulders and down beneath each arm  hand holding red leather collar closed at the throat  head up and
staying that way on its own  steady eyes meeting with blase dignity the eyes of whoever passes  the dignity of a man risen by will
from the ashes of withdrawal and now on the upswing and with places to go and potentially considerate canadians to see  a
charming and potentially once again in the not too distant future gorgeous creature with the renewed wherewithal to now meet the
eyes of inman sq  pedestrians veering sharply away from the residual smells of men s room stall and subway vomit  the ashes
from which he s been rescued and risen once again  feeling righter than rain  a rind of moon hanging cocked above a four spired
church  and the emergent stars are yo yos  you feel  after a seizure  poor tony feels as if he could cast them out  draw them in
again at will 
the way poor tony krause  lolasister  and susan t  cheese became mercenary adjuncts to something dour bertraund antitoi
had invited them to call the  front contre o n a n isme  was that  for a heavily cut bundle to split six ways  lolasister  susan t 
cheese  p  t  krause  bridget tenderhole  equus reese  and the late stokely   dark star   mcnair had had to wear identical red
leather coats and auburn wigs and spike heels and go and hang around the lobby of harvard square s sheraton commander hotel
with six mannish looking women in the same wigs and coats while an androgynous quebecer insurgent who filled out h his red
leather coat in a way that made bridget tenderhole dig his nails into his palms in sheer green envy came through the
commander s revolving lucite doors and strode purposefully into the crowded epaulet ballroom and threw foul semi liquid violet
waste from a souvenir miniature waste displacement barrel in the face of the canadian minister of inter o n a n  trade  who was
addressing the u s  press from a leaf shaped rostrum  the decoys were then required to mill hysterically in the lobby  all twelve
of them  and then hit the revolving doors and disperse in a dozen different vectors as the androgynous waste wielding quebecer
legged it out of the epaulet ballroom and lobby pursued by white suited men with earplugs and cobray m l   subautomatics  so
the security guys d see identical epicene figures high heeling it away in different directions and get fuddled about who to chase 
susan t  cheese and poor tony d met the antitoi bros    only one of whom could or would speak  and who d been in charge of
the diversionary aspects of the sheraton commander operation  and had clearly been subordinate to still other quebecers of way
higher i q    krause and s t c  had met them at inman square s ryle s tavern  which had gender dysphoric night every

 second wednesday  and attracted comely and unrough trade  and which poor tony passed now  ryle s   just after the man o  war
grille  now only a block or so from the antitois  glass and novelty shop front  feeling not so much quite ill again as just deeply
tired  after only five or so blocks   that post fever  sleep for a week type cellular fatigue   and is debating with himself about
whether to have a go at the purses of the two young and unstriking women walking just a few steps ahead  both of their purses
hanging only by the flimsiest of evening gown width straps from slumped shoulders  the duo interracial  rare and disquieting in
metro boston  the black girl talking a click a minute and the white one not responding  her weary stolid plod and air of inattention
fairly begging for a purse snatch  both of them with an air about them of routine victimization  the sort of demoralized lassitude
poor tony felt always guaranteed a minimum of protest or pursuit   though the white girl wore formidable looking running
shoes under her tartan skirt  so intent was poor tony krause on the logistics and implications of the possible purses dangled as if
by god right before him   how different to hit the antitois  doorstep with liquid assets  to request a transaction rather than bare
charity  more almost a social call than a contemptible withdrawn snivel for compassion   so intent as he sidestepped an
impressive pile of dog droppings and passed across the broad windows of the man o  war that he never saw his old former
crewmate mad matty pemulis  a sure source of compassion  looking up and out and down and back up  aghast in recognition of
what poor tony has come through the corridor to resemble 
geoffrey day s noted the way most of the male residents of ennet house have special little cognomens for their genitals  e g

hog  which had been frequent  the penis in question had been that curious two or three shades darker than the rest of lenz that
people s penises sometimes are  lenz had brandished it at his roommates whenever he wished to emphasize a point  it had been
short and thick and blunt  and lenz described the hog as a primo example of what he called the polish curse  viz  undistinguished
length but sobering circumference   easy on the bottom but tears hell out of the sides  brother   this had been his description of the
polish curse  a surprising amount of day s recovery journal is filled with quotations from r  lenz  lenz s discharge had moved

and re ennet house resident kate gompert and this depression issue  some psychiatric patients   plus a certain percentage
of people who ve gotten so dependent on chemicals for feelings of well being that when the chemicals have to be abandoned they
undergo a loss trauma that reaches way down deep into the soul s core systems   these persons know firsthand that there s more
than one kind of so called  depression   one kind is low grade and sometimes gets called anhedonia       or simple melancholy 
it s a kind of spiritual torpor in which one loses the ability to feel pleasure or attachment to things formerly important  the avid
bowler drops out of his league and stays home at night staring dully at kick boxing cartridges  the gourmand is off his feed  the
sensualist finds his beloved unit all of a sudden to be so much feelingless gristle  just hanging there  the devoted wife and mother
finds the thought of her family about as moving  all of a sudden  as a theorem of euclid  it s a kind of emotional novocaine  this
form of depression  and while it s not overtly painful its deadness is disconcerting and      well  depressing  kate gompert s always
thought of this anhedonic state as a kind of radical abstracting of everything  a hollowing out of stuff that used to have affective
content  terms the undepressed toss around and take for granted as full and fleshy   happiness  joie de vivre  preference  love  
are stripped to their skeletons and reduced to abstract ideas  they have  as it were  denotation but not connotation  the anhedonic
can still speak about happiness and meaning et ah  but she has become incapable of feeling anything in them  of understanding
anything about them  of hoping anything about them  or of believing them to exist as anything more than concepts  everything
becomes an outline of the thing  objects become schemata  the world becomes a map of the world  an anhedonic can navigate 
but has no location  i e  the anhedonic becomes  in the lingo of boston aa  unable to identify 
it s worth noting that  among younger e t a s  the standard take on dr  j  o  incandenza s suicide attributes his putting his
head in the microwave to this kind of anhedonia  this is maybe because anhedonia s often associated with the crises that afflict
extremely goal oriented people who reach a certain age having achieved all or more than all than they d hoped for  the what doesit all mean type crisis of middle aged americans  in fact this is in fact not what killed incandenza at all  in fact the presumption
that he d achieved all his goals and found that the achievement didn t confer meaning or joy on his existence says more about the
students at e t a  than it says about orin s and hal s father  still under the influence of the delint like carrot and stick
philosophies of their hometown coaches rather than the more paradoxical schtitt incandenza lyle school  younger athletes who
can t help gauging their whole worth by their place in an ordinal ranking use the idea that achieving their goals and finding the
gnawing sense of worthlessness still there in their own gut as a kind of psychic bogey  something that they can use to justify
stopping on their way down to dawn drills to smell flowers along the e t a  paths  the idea that achievement doesn t
automatically confer interior worth is  to them  still  at this age  an abstraction  rather like the prospect of their own death    caius
is mortal  and so on  deep down  they all still view the competitive carrot as the grail  they re mostly going through the motions
when they invoke anhedonia  they re mostly small children  keep in mind  listen to any sort of sub    exchange you hear in the
bathroom or food line   hey there  how are you    number eight this week  is how i am   they all still worship the carrot  with the
possible exception of the tormented lamont chu  they all still subscribe to the delusive idea that the continent s second ranked
fourteen year old feels exactly twice as worthwhile as the continent s    
deluded or not  it s still a lucky way to live  even though it s temporary  it may well be that the lower ranked little kids at
e t a  are proportionally happier than the higher ranked kids  since we  who are mostly not small children  know it s more
invigorating to want than to have  it seems  though maybe this is just the inverse of the same delusion 
hal incandenza  though he has no idea yet of why his father really put his head in a specially dickied microwave in the year
of the trial size dove bar  is pretty sure that it wasn t because of standard u s  anhedonia  hal himself hasn t had a bona fide
intensity of interior life type emotion since he was tiny  he finds terms like joie and value to be like so many variables in rarified

 equations  and he can manipulate them well enough to satisfy everyone but himself that he s in there  inside his own hull  as a
human being   but in fact he s far more robotic than john wayne  one of his troubles with his moms is the fact that avril
incandenza believes she knows him inside and out as a human being  and an internally worthy one at that  when in fact inside hal
there s pretty much nothing at all  he knows  his moms avril hears her own echoes inside him and thinks what she hears is him 
and this makes hal feel the one thing he feels to the limit  lately  he is lonely 
it s of some interest that the lively arts of the millennial u s a  treat anhedonia and internal emptiness as hip and cool  it s
maybe the vestiges of the romantic glorification of weltschmerz  which means world weariness or hip ennui  maybe it s the fact
that most of the arts here are produced by world weary and sophisticated older people and then consumed by younger people who
not only consume art but study it for clues on how to be cool  hip   and keep in mind that  for kids and younger people  to be hip
and cool is the same as to be admired and accepted and included and so unalone  forget so called peer pressure  it s more like
peer hunger  no  we enter a spiritual puberty where we snap to the fact that the great transcendent horror is loneliness  excluded
encagement in the self  once we ve hit this age  we will now give or take anything  wear any mask  to fit  be part of  not be alone 
we young  the u s  arts are our guide to inclusion  a how to  we are shown how to fashion masks of ennui and jaded irony at a
young age where the face is fictile enough to assume the shape of whatever it wears  and then it s stuck there  the weary cynicism
that saves us from gooey sentiment and unsophisticated naivete  sentiment equals na ivete on this continent  at least since the
reconfiguration   one of the things sophisticated viewers have always liked about j  o  incandenza s the american century as
seen through a brick is its unsubtle thesis that naivete is the last true terrible sin in the theology of millennial america  and since
sin is the sort of thing that can be talked about only figuratively  it s natural that himself s dark little cartridge was mostly about a
myth  viz  that queerly persistent u s  myth that cynicism and naivete are mutually exclusive  hal  who s empty but not dumb 
theorizes privately that what passes for hip cynical transcendence of sentiment is really some kind of fear of being really human 
since to be really human fat least as he conceptualizes it  is probably to be unavoidably sentimental and naive and goo prone and
generally pathetic  is to be in some basic interior way forever infantile  some sort of not quite right looking infant dragging itself
anaclitically around the map  with big wet eyes and froggy soft skin  huge skull  gooey drool  one of the really american things
about hal  probably  is the way he despises what it is he s really lonely for  this hideous internal self  incontinent of sentiment and
need  that pules and writhes just under the hip empty mask  anhedonia       
the american century as seen through a brick s main and famous key image is of a piano string vibrating   a high d  it
looks like   vibrating  and making a very sweet unadorned solo sound indeed  and then a little thumb comes into the frame  a
blunt moist pale and yet dingy thumb  with disreputable stuff crusted in one of the nail corners  small and unlined  clearly an
infantile thumb  and as it touches the piano string the high sweet sound immediately dies  and the silence that follows is
excruciating  later in the film  after much mordant and didactic panoramic brick following  we re back at the piano string  and the
thumb is removed  and the high sweet sound recommences  extremely pure and solo  and yet now somehow  as the volume
increases  now with something rotten about it underneath  there s something sick sweet and overripe and potentially putrid about
the one clear high d as its volume increases and increases  the sound getting purer and louder and more dysphoric until after a
surprisingly few seconds we find ourselves right in the middle of the pure undampered sound longing and even maybe praying for
the return of the natal thumb  to shut it up 
hal isn t old enough yet to know that this is because numb emptiness isn t the worst kind of depression  that dead eyed
anhedonia is but a rem ora on the ventral flank of the true predator  the great white shark of pain  authorities term this condition
clinical depression or involutional depression or unipolar dysphoria  instead of just an incapacity for feeling  a deadening of soul 
the predator grade depression kate gompert always feels as she withdraws from secret marijuana is itself a feeling  it goes by
many names   anguish  despair  torment  or q v  burton s melancholia or yev tuschenko s more authoritative psychotic
depression   but kate gompert  down in the trenches with the thing itself  knows it simply as it 
it is a level of psychic pain wholly incompatible with human life as we know it  it is a sense of radical and thoroughgoing evil
not just as a feature but as the essence of conscious existence  it is a sense of poisoning that pervades the self at the self s most
elementary levels  it is a nausea of the cells and soul  it is an unnumb intuition in which the world is fully rich and animate and
un map like and also thoroughly painful and malignant and antagonistic to the self  which depressed self it billows on and
coagulates around and wraps in its black folds and absorbs into itself  so that an almost mystical unity is achieved with a world
every constituent of which means painful harm to the self  its emotional character  the feeling gompert describes it as  is probably
mostly indescribable except as a sort of double bind in which any all of the alternatives we associate with human agency   sitting
or standing  doing or resting  speaking or keeping silent  living or dying   are not just unpleasant but literally horrible 
it is also lonely on a level that cannot be conveyed  there is no way kate gompert could ever even begin to make someone
else understand what clinical depression feels like  not even another person who is herself clinically depressed  because a person
in such a state is incapable of empathy with any other living thing  this anhedonic inability to identify is also an integral part of
it  if a person in physical pain has a hard time attending to anything except that pain        a clinically depressed person cannot
even perceive any other person or thing as independent of the universal pain that is digesting her cell by cell  everything is part of
the problem  and there is no solution  it is a hell for one 
the authoritative term psychotic depression makes kate gompert feel especially lonely  specifically the psychotic part 
think of it this way  two people are screaming in pain  one of them is being tortured with electric current  the other is not  the
screamer who s being tortured with electric current is not psychotic  her screams are circumstantially appropriate  the screaming
person who s not being tortured  however  is psychotic  since the outside parties making the diagnoses can see no electrodes or
measurable amperage  one of the least pleasant things about being psychotically depressed on a ward full of psychotically
depressed patients is coming to see that none of them is really psychotic  that their screams are entirely appropriate to certain
circumstances part of whose special charm is that they are undetectable by any outside party  thus the loneliness  it s a closed
circuit  the current is both applied and received from within 
the so called  psychotically depressed  person who tries to kill herself doesn t do so out of quote  hopelessness  or any abstract
conviction that life s assets and debits do not square  and surely not because death seems suddenly appealing  the person in
whom its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump

 from the window of a burning high rise  make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows  their terror of falling
from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing spec ulatively at the same window just checking out
the view  i e  the fear of falling remains a constant  the variable here is the other terror  the fire s flames  when the flames get
close enough  falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors  it s not desiring the fall  it s terror of the flames 
and yet nobody down on the sidewalk  looking up and yelling  don t   and  hang on    can understand the jump  not really  you d
have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling 
but and so the idea of a person in the grip of it being bound by a  suicide contract  some well meaning substance abuse
halfway house makes her sign is simply absurd  because such a contract will constrain such a person only until the exact psychic
circumstances that made the contract necessary in the first place assert themselves  invisibly and indescribably  that the wellmeaning halfway house staff does not understand its overriding terror will only make the depressed resident feel more alone 
one fellow psychotically depressed patient kate gompert came to know at newton wellesley hospital in newton two years
ago was a man in his fifties  he was a civil engineer whose hobby was model trains   like from lionel trains inc   etc    for
which he erected incredibly intricate systems of switching and track that filled his basement recreation room  his wife brought
photographs of the trains and networks of trellis and track into the locked ward  to help remind him  the man said he had been
suffering from psychotic depression for seventeen straight years  and kate gompert had had no reason to disbelieve him  he was
stocky and swart with thinning hair and hands that he held very still in his lap as he sat  twenty years ago he had slipped on a
patch of   in l brand oil from his model train tracks and bonked his head on the cement floor of his basement rec room in
wellesley hills  and when he woke up in the e r  he was depressed beyond all human endurance  and stayed that way  he d never
once tried suicide  though he confessed that he yearned for unconsciousness without end  his wife was very devoted and loving 
she went to catholic mass every day  she was very devout  the psychotically depressed man  too  went to daily mass when he
was not institutionalized  he prayed for relief  he still had his job and his hobby  he went to work regularly  taking medical leaves
only when the invisible torment got too bad for him to trust himself  or when there was some radical new treatment the
psychiatrists wanted him to try  they d tried tricyciics  m a o i s  insulin comas  selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors        the new and side effect laden quadracyclics  they d scanned his lobes and affective matrices for lesions and
scars  nothing worked  not even high amperage e c t  relieved it  this happens sometimes  some cases of depression are
beyond human aid  the man s case gave kate gompert the howling fantods  the idea of this man going to work and to mass and
building miniaturized railroad networks day after day after day while feeling anything like what kate gompert felt in that ward
was simply beyond her ability to imagine  the rationo spintual part of her knew this man and his wife must be possessed of a
courage way off any sort of known courage chart  but in her toxified soul kate gompert felt only a paralyzing horror at the idea
of the squat dead eyed man laying toy track slowly and carefully in the silence of his wood panelled rec room  the silence total
except for the sounds of the track being oiled and snapped together and laid into place  the man s head full of poison and worms
and every cell in his body screaming for relief from flames no one else could help with or even feel 
the permanently psychotically depressed man was finally transferred to a place on long island to be evaluated for a radical
new type of psychosurg ery where they supposedly went in and yanked out your whole limbic system  which is the part of the
brain that causes all sentiment and feeling  the man s fondest dream was anhedonia  complete psychic numbing  i e  death in life 
the prospect of radical psychosurgery was the dangled carrot that kate guessed still gave the man s life enough meaning for him
to hang onto the windowsill by his fingernails  which were probably black and gnarled from the flames  that and his wife  he
seemed genuinely to love his wife  and she him  he went to bed every night at home holding her  weeping for it to be over  while
she prayed or did that devout thing with beads 
the couple had gotten kate gompert s mother s address and had sent kate an xmas card the last two years  mr  and mrs 
ernest feaster of wellesley hills ma  stating that she was in their prayers and wishing her all available joy  kate gompert doesn t
know whether mr  ernest feaster s limbic system got yanked out or not  whether he achieved anhedonia  the xmas cards had had
excruciating little watercolor pictures of locomotives on them  she could barely stand to think about them  even at the best of
times  which the present was not

ms  ruth van cleve s first day off new residents  three day house restriction  allowed now to hit meetings outside enfield if
accompanied by some more senior resident the staff judges safe  ruth van cleve in spike heels walking alongside a psychotically
depressed kate gompert on prospect just south of inman square  cambridge  a little after     h   yammering nonstop 
ruth van cleve is shaping up to be excruciating for kate gompert to be around  ruth van cleve hails from braintree on the
south shore  is many kilos underweight  wears brass colored lipstick  and has dry hair teased out in the big hair fashion of
decades past  her face has the late stage ice       addict s concave long jawed insectile look  her hair is a dry tangled cloud 
with tiny little eyes and bones and projecting beak underneath  joelle v d  d said it almost looked like ruth van cleve s hair grew
her head instead of the other way around  kate gompert s hair is butcher block cut and has recognizable color  at least 
kate gompert hasn t slept in four nights  and her slumped progress up the prospect sidewalk resembles the lazy tack of a boat
in no rush  ruth van cleve talks nonstop into her right ear  it s around   ooh  on saturday and the sodium streetlights keep going
off and then on again with a stuttered hum  some connection in them loose somewhere  foot traffic is dense  and the undead and
drunks who live in the streets around inman square also crowd the sidewalk s edges  and if kate g  looks at the images of
passersby in the darkened shop windows they become  pedestrians and undead stem artists  just heads that seem to float across
each window unconnected to anything  as in disconnected floating heads  in doorways by shops are incomplete persons in
wheelchairs with creative receptacles where limbs should be and hand lettered invitations to help them 
an oral narrative begins to emerge  ms  ruth v c  has been remanded to ennet house by d s s  and family court after her
newborn baby was discovered in a braintree ma alley swaddled in walmart advertising circulars whose harvest moon value
specials had expired        a sunday  ruth van cleve had rather unshrewdly left the hospital i d  bracelet with its d o b  and her
own name and health card   on the discarded infant s wrist  the infant is apparently now in a south shore hospital incubator 

 attached to machines and tapering off the clonidine       it received for in utero addictions to substances kate gompert can
only speculate about        the father of ruth van cleve s child  she reports  is under the protection and care of the norfolk
county correctional authority  awaiting sentencing for what ruth van cleve describes several times as operating a pharmaceutical company without a license 
what s remarkable to kate gompert is that she seems to be able to move forward without any sort of conscious movingforward type volitions  she puts her left foot in front of her right foot and then her right foot in front of her left foot  and she s
moving forward  her whole self  when all she s capable of concentrating on is one foot and then the other foot  heads glide by in
the darkened windows  some of the latino males in the vicinity do a kind of sexual checking out as they pass   even though
underweight and dry haired and kind of haggish  ruth van cleve s manner and attire and big hair broadcast that she s all about
sexuality and sex 
a negative thing about opting for recovery in na instead of aa is availability and location of meetings  in other words fewer
na meetings  on a saturday night you could stand on the roof of ennet house in enfield and be hard pressed to spit in any
direction without hitting some aa venue nearby  whereas the closest saturday p m  na meeting is n  cambridge s clean and
serene group  infamous for cross talk and chair throwing  and the thing s beginner s mtng  goes from      to  l  h  and the
regular from      to     h   purposely late  to offset the saturday night jones so many drug addicts suffer weekly  saturday still
being the week s special mythic party night even for persons who long ago ceased to be able to do anything but party

the two move in and out of cones of epileptic light from fluttering street lamps  kate gompert is trying not to shudder as
ruth van cleve asks her if she knows someplace you can pick up a good toothbrush cheap  kate gom pert s entire spiritual energy

in his cheek and makes a display of leaning out to spit  he appears to be studying the scrolling credits very closely 
 so what is this   fran unwin says 
hal looks over at her very slowly  then even more slowly raises his right arm and points around the tennis ball he s squeezing
at the monitor  where the cartridge s    point title is still trickling redly over the credits and frozen scene 
bridget  oone gives him a look   what s up your particular butt  
 i m isolating  i came in here to be by myself  
she has this way that gets to hal of digging the chocolate yogurt out with the spoon and then inverting the spoon  turning the
spoon over  so that it always enters her mouth upside down and her tongue gets to contact the confection immediately  without the
mediation of cold spoon  and for some reason this has always gotten under hal s skin 
 so then you should ve locked the door  
 except there aren t locks on the v r  doors        as you quite well know  
round faced frannie unwin says  sshhh  

 then too sometimes boone plays with the laden spoon  makes it fly around in front of her face like a child s plane before
inverting it and sticking it in   maybe this is partly because this is a public room  for everybody  that your thinking person
probably wouldn t choose to isolate in  
hal leans over to spit and lets the spit hang for a while before he lets it go  so it hangs there slowly distending 
boone withdraws the clean spoon just as slowly   no matter how sullen and pouty that person is over that person s play or
near loss in full view of a whole crowd that day  i hear  
 bridget  i forgot to tell you i saw that rite aid s having an enormous clearance on emetics  if i were you i d scoot right over  
 you are vile  
bernadette longley sticks her long boxy head in the door and sees bridget boone and says  i thought i heard you in here  and
comes in uninvited with jennie bash in tow 
hal whimpers 
jennie bash looks at the large screen  the cartridge s theme music is female choral and very heavy and ironic on the descants 
bernadette long ley looks at hal   you know there s a totally huge lady cruising the halls looking for you  with a notebook and a
very determined expression  
boone banks the spoon back and forth absently   he s isolating  he won t respond and is spitting extra repulsively to get
across the point  
jennie bash says  haven t you got a huge paper due for thierry tomorrow  there was moaning coming from struck and
shaw s room  
hal packs chew down with his tongue   done  
 figures   bridget boone says 
 done  redone  formatted  printed  proofed  collated  stapled  
 proofed to within its life   boone says  barrel rolling the spoon  hal can tell she s done a couple one hitters  he s looking
straight at the wall s screen  squeezing the ball so hard his forearm keeps swelling to twice its size 
 plus i hear your best friend in the whole world did something really funny today   longley says 
 she means pemulis   fran unwin tells hal 
bridget boone makes dive bomber sounds and swoops the spoon around 
 sounds like too good a story not to save and let my craving for it build and build until finally it s like i have to hear it or die
right on the spot  
 what is up his butt   jennie bash asks fran unwin  fran unwin s a sort of hanuman faced girl with a torso and trunk about
twice as long as her legs  and a scuttly  vaguely simian style of play  bernadette longley wears knee length candy cane trousers
and a sweatshirt with the fleecy inside out  all the girls are now in socks  hal notes that girls always seem to slip out of their shoes
when they assume any kind of spectatorial posture  eight empty white sneakers now sit mute and weird at various points  slightly
sunk in carpet pile  no two of the shoes face quite the same exact direction  male players  on the other hand  tend to leave the
footwear on when they come in and sit down somewhere  girls literally embody the idea of making yourself at home  males 
when they come in somewhere and sit down  project an air of transience  remain suited up and mobile  it s the same whenever
hal comes in and sits down someplace where people are already gathered  he s aware that they sense he s somehow there only in a
very technical sense  that he s got an air of moment s notice readiness to leave about him  boone extends her carton of
tcby       toward longley in an inviting way  even tilting it invitingly back and forth  longley puffs her cheeks and blows air
out with a fatigued sound  at least three different smells of cologne and skin cream struggle for primacy in here  bridget boone s
free la gear shoes are both on their sides from the force of having been almost kicked off her feet  hal s spit makes a sound
against the bottom of the wastebasket  jennie bash has bigger arms than hal  the viewing room is redly dim  bash asks unwin
what they re watching 
blood sister  one tough nun  one of himself s few commercial successes  wouldn t have made near the money it made if it
hadn t come out just as interlace was starting to purchase first run features for its rental menus and hyping the cartridges with
one time spontaneous disseminations  it was the sort of sleazy looking shocksploitation film that would have had a two week run
in multiplex theaters   and above and then gone right to the featureless brown boxes of magnetic video limbo  hal s critical take
on the film is that himself  at certain dark points when abstract theory issues seemed to provide an escape from the far more
wrenching creative work of making humanly true or entertaining cartridges  had made films in certain commercial type genre
modes that so grotesquely exaggerated the formulaic schticks of the genres that they became ironic metacinematic parodies on the
genres   sub inversions of the genres   cognoscenti taken in were wont to call them  the metacinematic parody idea itself was aloof
and over clever  to hal s way of thinking  and he s not comfortable with the way himself always seemed to get seduced by the
very commercial formulae he was trying to invert  especially the seductive formulae of violent payback  i e  the cathartic
bloodbath  i e  the hero trying with every will fiber to eschew the generic world of the stick and fist and but driven by unjust
circumstance back to the violence again  to the cathartic final bloodbath the audience is brought to applaud instead of mourn 
himself s best in this vein was the night wears a sombrero  a langesque metawestern but also a really good western  with
chintzy homemade interior sets but breathtaking exteriors shot outside tucson az  an ambivalent but finaliy avenging son story
played out against dust colored skies and big angles of flesh colored mountain  plus with minimal splatter  shot men clutching
their chests and falling deliciously sideways  all hats staying on at all times  blood sister  one tough nun was a supposedly
ironic lampoon of the avenging cleric splatter films of the late b s     s  nor did himself make any friends on either side of the
concavity  trying to shoot the thing in canada 
hal tries to imagine the tall slumped tremulous stork shape of himself inclined at an osteoporotic angle over digital editing
equipment for hours on end  deleting and inserting code  arranging blood sister  one tough nun into subversive inversion  and
can t summon one shadowy idea of what himself might have been feeling as he patiently labored  maybe that was the point of the
thing s metasilliness  to have nothing really felt going on       
jennie bash has left v r    s door agape  and idris arslanian and todd   postal weight   possalthwaite and kent blott all drift
in and sit indian style in a loose hemisphere on the thick carpet between the girls  recumbency and hal s recumbency  and are

 more or less considerately quiet  they all keep their sneakers on  postal weight s nose is a massive proboscoid bandaged thing 
kent blott wears a sportfisherman s cap with an extremely long bill  that queer faint smell of hot dogs that seems to follow idris
arslanian around begins to insinuate itself into the room s colognes  he isn t wearing the rayon handkerchief as a blindfold but
does have it tied around his neck  no one asks him about it  all the littler kids are consummate spectators and are sucked
immediately into blood sister s unfolding narrative  and the older females seem to take some kind of psychic cue from the little
boys and subside  too  and watch  until after a while hal s the only person in the room who isn t      absorbed 
the entertainment s uptake is that a tough biker chick type girl from the mean streets of toronto is found o d  d  beaten up 
molested  and robbed of her leather jacket outside the portcullis of a downtown convent and is rescued  nursed  befriended 
spiritually guided  and converted    saved  is the weak entendre made much of in the first act s dialogue   by a tough looking
older nun who it turns out  she reveals  the tough older nun   had herself been hauled up out of a life of harleys  narcotics dealing
and  addiction by an even tougher even older nun  a nun who had herself been saved by a tough ex biker nun  and so on  the
latest saved biker chick becomes a tough and street smart nun in the same urban order  and is known on the mean streets as blood
sister  and wimple or not still rides her hawg from parish to parish and still knows akido and is not to be fucked with  is the word
on the streets 
the motivational crux here being that almost this whole order of nuns is staffed by nuns who d been saved from toronto s
mean  dead end streets by other older tougher saved nuns  so  endless novenas later  blood sister eventually feels this transitive
spiritual urge to go out and find a troubled adolescent female of her own  to  save  and bring into the order  thereby discharging her
soul s debt to the old tough nun who d saved her  through processes obscure  a toronto troubled but savable adolescent girldirectory of some sort  bridget boone cuts wise   blood sister eventually takes on a burn scarred  deeply troubled adolescent
punker type toronto girl who is sullen and  yes  reasonably tough  but is also vulnerable and emotionally tormented  the girl s
pink shiny burn scarred face tends to writhe in misery whenever she thinks blood sister s not looking  by the terrible depredations
she s endured as a result of her rapacious and unshakable addiction to crank cocaine  the kind you have to convert and cook up
yourself  and with ether  which is highly combustible  and which people used before somebody found out baking soda and
temperature flux would do the same thing  which dates the film s b s  time period even more clearly than the tough tortured punk
girl s violet stelliform coiffure       
but so blood sister eventually gets the girl clean  by nurturing her through withdrawal in a locked sacristy  and the girl
becomes less sullen by degrees that almost have audible clicks to them   the girl stops trying to dicky the lock of the
sacramental wine cabinet  stops farting on purpose during matins and vespers  stops going up to the trappists who hang around
the convent and asking them for the time and other sly little things to try to make them slip up and speak aloud  etc  a couple
times the girl s face writhes in emotional torment and vulnerability even when blood sister s looking  the girl gets a severe and
somewhat lesbianic haircut  and her roots establish themselves as softly brown  blood sister  revealing biceps like nobody s
business  beats the girl at arm wrestling  they both laugh  they compare tattoos  this marks the start of a brutally drawn out
getting to know and trust you montage  a genre convention  this montage involving harley rides at such speeds that the girl
has to keep her hand on blood sister s head to keep b s  s wimple from flying off  and long conversational walks filmed at wideangle  and protracted and basically unwinnable games of charades with the trappists  plus some quick scenes of blood sister finding the girl s marlboros and dildo facsimile lighter in the wastebasket  of the girl doing chores unsullenly under b s  s grudgingly
approving eye  of candle lit scripture study sessions with the girl s finger under each word she reads  of the girl carefully snipping
the last bits of split violet ends from her soft brown hair  of the more senior tough nuns punching blood sister s shoulder
approvingly as the girl s eyes start to get that impending conversion gleam in them  then  finally  of blood sister and the girl habitshopping  the girl s burned lantern jaw and hairless promethean brow frozen in a sunlit montage climax shot under a novitiate
wimple s gull wings   all accompanied by   no kidding    getting to know you   which hal imagines the stork justified to
himself as subversively saccharine  this all takes about half an hour  bridget boone  of the indianapolis archdiocese  begins to
declaim briefly on blood sister  one tough nun s ironic anti catholic subthesis   that the deformed addicted girl s  salvation 
here seemed simply the exchange of one will obliterating  habit  for another  substituting one sort of outlandish head decoration
for another   and gets pinched by jennie bash and shushed by just about everyone in the room but hal  who could pass for
asleep except for the brief lists to port over the wastebasket  to spit  and in fact is experiencing some of the radical loss of
concentration that attends thc withdrawal and is thinking about another  even more familiar j  o  incandenza cartridge even
while he watches this one with the other e t a s  this other attention object is the late himself s so called  inversion  of the
corporate politics genre  low temperature civics  an executive suite soap opera filled with power plays  position jockeyings 
timid adulteries  martinis  and malignantly pretty female executives in elegant tight fitting dress for successwear who eat their
paunched and muddled male counterparts for political lunch  hal knows that l tc wasn t an inversion or lampoon at all  but
derived right from the dark b s    os period when himself had changed careers from government service to private
entreprenurism  when a sudden infusion of patent receipts left him feeling post carrot anhedonic and existentially unmoored  and
himself took an entire year off to drink wild turkey and watch broadcast television tycoon operas like lorimar s dynasty et al  in
a remote spa off canada s northwest coast  where he supposedly met and bonded with lyle  now of the e t a  weight room 
what s intriguing but unknown to everyone in v r    is the way boone s take on himself s take on the substitution of onecrutch for another interpretation of substituting catholic devotion for chemical dependence is very close to the way many not yetdesperate enough newcomers to boston aa see boston aa as just an exchange of slavish dependence on the bottle pipe for
slavish dependence on meetings and banal shibboleths and robotic piety  an  attitude of platitude   and use this idea that it s still
slavish dependence as an excuse to stop trying boston aa  and to go back to the original slavish substance dependence  until that
dependence has finally beaten them into such a double bound desperation that they finally come back in with their faces hanging
off their skulls and beg to be told just what platitudes to shout  and how high to adjust their vacant grins 
some substance dependent persons  though  have already been so broken by the time they first come in that they don t care
about stuff like substitution or banality  they ll give their left nut to trade their original dependence in for robotic platitudes and
pep rally cheer  they re the ones with the gun to their head  the ones who stick and hang  it remains to be determined whether
joelle van dyne  whose first appearance in a james o  incan denza project occurred in this very low temperature civics  is one

 of these people who ve come into aa na shattered enough to stick  but she s starting to i d  more and more with the
commitment speakers she hears who did come in shattered enough to know it s get straight or die  a click and a half straight
downhill from e t a   joelle is hitting the reality is for people that can t handle drugs group  a meeting of the na splinter
cocaine anonymous        mostly because the meeting s in the st  elizabeth s hospital grand rounds auditorium  just a couple
floors down from where don gately  whom she just got done visiting and mopping the massive unconscious forehead of  is lying
in the trauma wing in a truly bad way  ca meetings have a long preamble and endless little xeroxed formalities they read aloud
at the start  is one reason joelle avoids ca  but the opening stuff is done by the time she gets down and comes in and gets some
burnt urn bottom coffee and finds an available seat  the only empty seats are in the meeting s back row    denial aisle   the back
rows are usually called   and joelle is surrounded by catexic newcomers crossing and uncrossing their legs every few seconds
and sniffing compulsively and looking like they re wearing everything they own  plus there s the row of standing men   there s a
certain hard faced type of male in boston fellowships who refuses ever to sit for meetings   standing behind the back row  legs
set wide and arms crossed and talking to each other out the sides of their mouths  and she can tell the standing men are looking at
her bare knees over her shoulder  making little comments about the knees and the veil  she thinks with fearful sentiment       of
don gately  a tube down his throat  torn by fever and guilt and shoulder pain  offered demerol by well meaning but clueless
m d s  in and out of delirium  torn  convinced that certain men with hats wished him ill  looking at his room s semi private ceiling
like it would eat him if he dropped his guard  the big blackboard up on the stage says the reality is for people that can t handle
drugs group welcomes tonight s commitment speakers  the freeway access group from mattapan  which is deep in the colored
part of boston where cocaine anonymous tends to be most heavily concentrated  the speaker just starting in at the podium when
joelle sits down is a tall yellowish colored man with a weightlifter s build and frightening eyes  sloe and a kind of tannin brown 
he s been in ca seven months  he says  he eschews the normal ca drugologue s macho war stories and gets right to his bottom 
his jumping off place  joelle can tell he s trying to tell the truth and not just posturing and performing the way so many cas seem
like they do  his story s full of colored idioms and those annoying little colored hand motions and gestures  but to joelle it doesn t
seem like she cares that much anymore  she can identify  the truth has a kind of irresistible unconscious attraction at meetings  no
matter what the color or fellowship  even denial aisle and the standing men are absorbed by the colored man s story  the colored
man says his thing is he d had a wife and a little baby daughter at home in mattapan s perry hill projects  and another baby on the
way  he d managed to hang on to his menial riveter s assistant job at universal bleacher right up the street from here in enfield
because his addiction to crank cocaine wasn t everyday  he smoked on your binge type basis  mostly weekends  hellacious 
psychopathic  bank account emptying binges  though  like getting strapped to a raytheon missile and you don t stop till that
missile stops  jim  he says his wife had got temp work cleaning houses  but when she worked they had to put their little girl in a
day care that just about ate her day s pay  so his paycheck was like their total float  and his weekend binges with the glass pipe
caused them no end of financial insecurity  which he mispronounces  which brings him to his last binge  the bottom  which 
predictably  occurred on a payday  this check just had to go for groceries and rent  they were two months back  and there was not
jack shit in the house in the way of to eat  at a smoke break at universal bleacher he d made sure and bought just one single vial 
for just a tensky  for a sunday night treat after a weekend of abstinence and groceries and quality time with his pregnant wife and
little daughter  the wife and little daughter were to meet him after work right off the bus stop at brighton best savings  right
under the big clock  to  help  him deposit the paycheck right then and there  he d let his wife stipulate the meeting at the bank
because he knew in a self disgusted way even then that there was this hazard of paycheck type incidents from binges he d pulled
in the past  and their financial insecurity was now whatever word s past the word deep shit  and he knew goddamn well he could
not afford to fuck up this time 
he says that s how he used to think of it to himself  fucking up 
he didn t even make it to the bus after clocking out  he said  two other holmeses       in riveting had three vials each 
which vials they had  like  brandished at him  and he d kicked in his one vial because two and a third vials v  one thin ass sundaynight vial was only a fucking fool way out of touch with the whole seize the opportunity concept could pass that shit up  in short
it was the familiar insanity of money in the pocket and no defense against the urge  and the thought of his woman holding his little
girl in her little knit cap and mittens standing under the big clock in cold march dusk didn t so much get pushed aside as somehow
shrink to a tiny locket size picture in the center of a part of him he and the holmeses had set out busily to kill  with the pipe 
he says he never made the bus  they passed a bottle of rye around the old ford mystique one of the holmeses profiled  and
fired up  right in the car  and after he once fired up with   in his pocket the fat woman with the little helmet with horns on it done
already like fucking sang  jim       
the man s hands grip the sides of the podium and he rests his weight on his elbow locked arms in a way that conveys both
abjection and pluck  he invites the cas to let s just draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the night s scene  which after the
check cashing stop got hazy with missile exhaust anyhow  but so he finally did get home to mattapan the next morning  saturday
morning  sick and green yellow and on that mean post crank slide  dying for more and willing to kill for more and yet so mortified
and ashamed of having done fucked up  again  that just going up the elevator to their apartment was maybe the bravest thing he d
ever done  up to that point  he felt 
it was like      in the a m  and they weren t there  there was nobody home  and in the sort of way where the place s
emptiness pulsed and breathed  an envelope was slid under the door from the b h a         not the salmon color of an eviction
notice but a green last warning re rent  and he went into the kitchen and opened up the fridge  hating himself for hoping there
was a beer  in the fridge was a jar of grape jelly near empty and a half a can of biscuit mix  and that  plus a sour empty fridge
odor  was all  jim  a little plastic jar of labelless food bank peanut butter so empty its insides had knife scrapes on the sides and a
little clotted box of salt was all there was in the whole rest of the kitchen 
but what sent his face clear down off his skull and broke him in two  though  was he said when he saw the pam shiny empty
biscuit pan on top of the stove and the plastic rind of the peanut butter s safety seal wrap on top of the wastebasket s tall pile  the
little locket picture in the back of his head swelled and became a sharp focused scene of his wife and little girl and little unborn
child eating what he now could see they must have eaten  last night and this morning  while he was out ingesting their groceries
and rent  this was his cliff edge  his personal intersection of choice  standing there loose faced in the kitchen  running his finger

 around a shiny pan with not one little crumb of biscuit left in it  he sat down on the kitchen tile with his scary eyes shut tight but
still seeing his little girl s face  they d ate some charity peanut butter on biscuits washed down with tapwater and a grimace 
their apartment was six floors up in perry hill s bldg     the window didn t open but could be broke through with a running
start 
he didn t kill himself  though  he says  he just got up and walked out  he didn t leave his wife a note  not nothing  he went
and walked the whole four clicks to shattuck shelter in jamaica plain  he felt like for sure they d of been better off without him 
he said  but he said he didn t know why but he didn t kill himself  but he didn t  he figures there was some god involvement 
sitting there on the floor  he just decided to go to shattuck and surrender and get straight and never ever have his little girl s
grimacing face in his hung over head ever again  james 
and shattuck shelter   by coincidence   that usually had a waiting list every march until it got warm  they d just kicked
out some sorry ass specimen for defecating in the shower  and they took him  the speaker  he asked for a ca meeting right away 
and a shattuck staff guy called somebody afro american with a lot of clean recovered time  and the speaker got taken to his first
ca meeting  that was     days ago tonight  that night  when the colored ca crocodile dropped him off back at the shattuck  
after he d wept in front of other colored men at his first meeting and told men he didn t know from shit about the big clock and
glass pipe and paycheck and the biscuits and his little girl s face   and after he come back to the shattuck and got buzzed through
and the buzzer sounded for supper  it turned out   by coincidence   that the saturday night shattuck supper was coffee and
peanut butter sandwiches  it was the end of the week and the shelter s donated food had run out  they only had pb on cheap ass
white bread and sunny square instant coffee  the cheap shit that doesn t even quite dissolve all the way 
he s got your autodidactic orator s way with emotional dramatic pauses that don t seem affected  joelle makes another line
down the styrofoam coffee cup with her fingernail and chooses consciously to believe it isn t affected  the story s emotive drama 
her eyes feel sandy from forgetting to blink  this always happens when you don t expect it  when it s a meeting you have to drag
yourself to and are all but sure will suck  the speaker s face has lost its color  shape  everything distinctive  something has taken
the tight ratchet in joelle s belly and turned it three turns to the good  it s the first time she s felt sure she wants to keep straight no
matter what it means facing  no matter if don gately takes demerol or goes to jail or rejects her if she can t show him the face 
it s the first time in a long time   tonight        joelle s even considered possibly showing somebody the face 
after the pause the speaker says all the other sorry motherfuckers in the shattuck shelter in there started in to bitching about
what was this shit  peanut butter sandwiches for fucking supper  the speaker says how whatever he silently thanked for just that
particular sandwich he held and chewed  washing it down with gritty sunny square coffee  that thing became his higher power 
he s now seven plus months clean  universal bleacher let him go  but he s got steady work at logan  pushing a third shift mop 
and a holmes on his crew s also in the program   by coincidence  his pregnant wife  it turned out  had gone to a unwed mothers
shelter with shantel  that night  she was still in there  d s s  still wouldn t let him appeal his wife s restraining order and see
shantel  but he got to talk to his little girl on the phone just last month  and he s now straight  from giving up and joining the
freeway access group and getting active and taking the voluntary suggestions of the fellowship of cocaine anonymous  his
wife was due to have her baby around xmas  he said he didn t know what was going to happen to him or his family  but he says
he has received certain promises from his new family   the freeway access group of cocaine anonymous   and so he had
certain hope type emotions about the future  inside  he didn t so much conclude or make obligatory reference to gratitude or any
of that usual shit as grip the lectern and shrug and say he d started feeling just last month that the choice he made on the kitchen
floor was the right choice  personally speaking 
entertainment wise  things take a rapid turn for the splattery once the tough girl blood sister seemed to have saved is found
bluely dead in her novitiate s cot  her habit s interior pockets stuffed with all kinds of substances and paraphernalia and her arm a
veritable forest of syringes  tight shot of b s   face working purply  staring down at the ex ex punker  suspecting foul play
instead of spiritual recidivism  blood sister  disregarding first the other cheek pieties and then the impassioned pleas and then the
direct orders of the vice mother superior   who happens now to be the tough nun who d saved blood sister  way back   begins
reverting to her former toronto mean street pre salvation tough biker chick ways  de mufflering her harley hawg  hauling an
age faded stud covered leather bike jacket out of storage and squeezing it over her pectoral swollen habit  unbandaging her most
lurid tattoos  shaking down former altar boys for information  flipping off motorists who get in her bike s way  meeting old streetcontacts in dim saloons and tossing back jiggers with even the most cirrhotic of them  beating  bludgeoning  akido ing  disarming
thugs of power tools  avenging the desalvation and demapping of her young charge  determined to prove that the girl s death was
no accident or backslide  that blood sister had not failed with the soul she d chosen to save to discharge her own soul s debt to the
tough old vice mother superior who d saved her  blood sister  so far back  several thuggish stuntmen and countless liters of
potassium thiocyanate       later  the truth does out  the novitiate girl had been murdered by the mother superior  the order s top
and toughest nun  this m s  is the nun who d saved the vice m s  who d saved blood sister  meaning  ironically  that the
evidence blood sister needs to prove that her salvation debt really was discharged is also evidence inimical to the legal interests
of the tough nun to whom blood sister s own saviour is obligated  so blood sister gets increasingly tortured and ill tempered as
evidence of the mother superior s guilt accretes  in one scene she says fuck  in another she swings a censer like a mace and brains
an old verger who s one of the mother superior s stooges  knocking his toothless head clean off  then  in act iii  a veritable orgy
of retribution follows the full emergence of the sordid truth  it seems that the tough old vice mother superior  viz  the nun who d
saved blood sister  had in fact not been saved  truly  after all   had in fact  during     years of exemplary novena saying and
wafer baking  been suffering a kind of hidden degenerative recidivist soul rot  and had resumed  the vice m s   at about the time
blood sister had donned the habit of full nunhood  had not only resumed substance dependence but had started actually dealing in
serious weights of whatever at the time was most profitable  which after     years had changed from marseillese heroin to
colombian freebaseable grade bing crosby  to support her own hidden habit  covertly operating a high volume retail operation
out of the order s community outreach rescue mission s little used confessionals  this nun s superior  the top tough mother
superior nun  stumbling onto the drug operation after the now demapped verger informed her that a suspicious number of
limousines were discharging gold chained and not very penitent looking persons into the order s community outreach rescue
mission  and disastrously unable to summon the pious humility to accept the fact that she d failed  it seemed  at truly and forever

 saving the ex dealer whose salvation the mother superior required to discharge the debt to the now retired octogenarian nun
who d saved her   this mother superior herself is the one who murdered blood sister s ex punk novitiate  to silence the girl 
what emerges is that blood sister s addicted punk girl s substance copping venue  when she was out there pre salvation  had
been nothing other than the vice mother superior s infamous community outreach rescue mission  in other words  the nun
who d saved blood sister but had herself been secretly unsaved had been the tough girl s bing dealer  is why the tough noncatholic girl d been so mysteriously adept at the confiteor  the order s mother superior had figured that it was only a matter of
time before the girl s conversion and salvation reached the sort of spiritual pitch where her guarded silence broke and she told
blood sister the seamy truth about the nun she  blood sister  thought had saved her  blood sister   so she  the mother superior 
had eliminated the girl s map   ostensibly  she  the mother superior  told her lieutenant  the vice mother superior  to save her
 the vice mother superior  from exposure and excommunication and maybe worse  if the girl weren t silenced       
this narratively prolix and tangled stuff all gets explicated at near kabuki volume during an appalling free for all in the
office of the mother superior who hadn t saved the vice m s  who d saved blood sister  with the two senior nuns   who d been
tough and unsaved back in the ontarian days when men were men and so were drug addicted bike chicks   teaming up and
kicking blood sister s ass  the fight scene a blur of swirling habite ments and serious martial arts against the spot lit backdrop of
the wall s huge decorative mahogany crucifix  with blood sister giving a good account of herself but still getting her wimple beat
in and finally  after several whirling kicks to the forehead  starting to bid adieu to her corporeal map and commend herself to the
arms of god  until the unsaved recidivist vice mother superior nun who d saved blood sister  wiping blood from her eyes after a
head butt and seeing the mother superior about to decapitate blood sister with the souvenir champlain era tomahawk the huron
nun who d been saved by the original founder of the toronto tough girl saving order had used to decapitate jesuit missionaries
before she  the tough huron nun  had been saved  seeing the tomahawk raised with both arms before the normally pious eyed old
mother superior s face   a face now rendered indescribable in aspect by the absence of humility and the passion for truthsilencing that add up to pure and radical evil   seeing now the upraised hatchet and demonized face of the m s   the unsaved
vice nun has a moment of epiphanic anti recidivist spiritual clarity  and averts blood sister s demapping by leaping across the
office and cold cocking the mother superior with a large decorative mahogany christian object so symbolically obvious it needn t
even be named  the object s symbolic unsubtlety making both hal and bridget boone cringe  now blood sister has the
champlain era hatchet  and the unsaved nun who d saved her has an unnamed object whose mahogany s no match for a hatchet 
and they stand facing each other over the prone mother superior s puddle of skirts  chests heaving  and the vice m s  has a
writhing expression under her askew wimple like go ahead  make the circle of recidivist retribution against the nun you thought
had saved you but ultimately couldn t even save herself complete  complete the lapsarian circuit or whatever  they stare at each
other for countless frames  the office wall behind them cruciformly pale where the unnamed object d hung  then blood sister
shrugs in resignation and drops the tomahawk  and turns and with an ironic little obeisance walks out the mother superior s office
door and through the little sacristy and over the altar and down the little convent nave  bike boots echoing on the tile  emphasizing
the silence  and out the big doors whose tympanum overhead is carved with a sword and a ploughshare and a syringe and a soupladle and the motto con traria sunt complementa  the heaviness of which makes hal cringe so severely it s boone
who has to supply the translation kent blott asks for        on screen  we re still following the tough nun  or ex nun   the fact
that the hatchet she resignedly dropped fetched the prone mother superior a pretty healthy knock is presented as clearly
accidental    because she  blood sister  is still walking away from the convent  moving emphatically and in a gradually deepening
focus  limping toughly eastward into the twittering toronto dawn  the cartridge s closing sequence shows her astride her hawg
on toronto s meanest street  about to lapse  backslide back into her tough pre saved ways  it s unclear in a way that s supposed
to be rich  her expression is agnostic at best  but the huge sign of a discount harley muffler outlet juts just at the horizon she s
roaring toward  the closing credits are the odd lime green of bugs on a windshield 
it s hard to tell whether boone and bash s applause is sarcastic  there s that post entertainment flurry of changed positions
and stretched limbs and critical sallies  out of nowhere hal remembers  smothergill  possalthwaite says he and the id man

the apparition receded  the red of its coat shrinking against the swinging view of prospect st  and pavement and dumpsters
and looming storefronts  ruth van cleve on its lurid tail and receding also  screaming bits of urban argot that became less faint
than swallowed  kate gompert held her hurt head and heard it roar  ruth van cleve s pursuit was slowed by her arms  which were
waving around as she screamed  and the apparition was swinging their purses to clear a path on the sidewalk before it  kate
gompert could see pedestrians leaping out into the street way up ahead to avoid getting clocked  the whole visual scene seemed
tinged in violet 
a voice under a storefront awning right nearby somewhere said   seen it  
kate gompert leaned over again and held the part of her head that surrounded her eye  the eye was palpably swelling shut 
and her whole vision was queerly violet  a sound in her head like a drawbridge being drawn up  implacable trundle and squeaks 
hot watery spit was flooding her mouth  and she kept swallowing against nausea 
 seen it  bet your ever living goddamn life i seen it   a kind of gargoyle seemed to detach itself from a storefront hardware
display and moved in  its motions oddly jerky  as in a film missing frames   seen the whole thing   it said  then repeated it   i m a
witness   it said 
kate gompert put her other arm out against the lightpost and hauled herself mostly upright  looking at it 
 witnessed the whole godfdamn thing   it said  in the eye that wasn t swelling shut the thing resolved violetly into a bearded
man in an army coat and a sleeveless army coat over that coat  spittle in his beard  one eye had a system of exploded arteries in it 
he shook like an old machine  there was a smell involved  the old man got right up close  looming in  so that pedestrians had to
curve out around both of them together  kate gompert could feel her pulse in her eye 
 witness  eyewitness  the whole thing   but he was looking someplace else  like more around at people passing   seen it  i m
him   not clear who he was shouting at  it wasn t her  and the passersby were paying that studious  urban kind of no attention as

 they broke and melted around them at the lightpost and then reformed  kate gompert had the idea that supporting herself against
the lightpost would keep her from throwing up  concussion is really another word for a bruised brain  she tried not to think about
it  that the impact had maybe sent one part of her brain slamming against her skull  and now that part was purply swelling  mashed
up against the inside of her skull  the lightpost she held herself up with was what had hit her   fellow  i m your fellow  witness 
saw it all   and the old fellow was holding a trembling palm up just under kate gompert s face  as if he wanted it thrown up into 
the palm was violet  with splotches of some sort of possible fungal decay  and with dark branching lines where the pink palmlines of people who don t live in dumpsters usually are  and kate gompert studied the palm abstractly  and the weather bleached
gigabucks       ticket on the pavement below it  the ticket seemed to recede into a violet mist and then move back up 
pedestrians barely glanced at them and then looked studiously elsewhere  a drunk looking pale girl and a street bum showing her
something in his hand   witnessed the whole thing being committed   the man remarked to a passerby with a cellular on his belt 
kate gompert couldn t summon the juice to tell him to go screw  that s the way it was said down here in the real city  go screw 
with a deft little thumb gesture  she couldn t even say go away  though the smell involved in the man made it worse  the nausea 
it seemed terribly important not to vomit  she could feel her pulse in the eye the pole had hit  as if the strain of vomiting could
aggravate the spongy purpling of the part of her brain the pole had bruised  the thought made her want to vomit in this horrid
palm that wouldn t stay still  she tried to reason  if the man had witnessed the whole thing then how could he think she d have
change to put in his hand  ruth van cleve had been listing some of her baby s jailed father s wittier aliases when kate gompert
had felt a hand strike her back and close around the strap of her purse  ruth van cleve had cried out as the apparition of just about
the most unattractive woman kate gompert had ever seen crashed forward between them  knocking them apart  ruth van cleve s
vinyl purse s strap gave right away  but kate gompert s thin but densely macrame d strap held around her shoulder and she was
pulled wrenchingly forward by the womanly apparition s momentum as it tried to sprint up prospect st   and the red hag like
figure was yanked wrenchingly back as the quality filene s all cotton french braidedly macrame d purse strap held  and kate
gompert had got a whiff of something danker than the dankest municipal sewage and a glimpse of what looked like a five day
facial growth on the hag s face as street tough ruth van cleve got a grip on her his its red leather coat  proclaiming the thief a son
of a mafun ho  kate gompert was staggering forward  trying to get her arm out of the strap s loop  they all three moved forward
together this way  the apparition spun itself violently around  trying to shake off ruth van cleve  and her its spin with her purse
took the strap attached kate gompert  who didn t weigh very much  out around in a wide circle  she d had a flashback of
reminiscence back to crack the whip at the wellesley hills skating club s rink s  wee blades  toddler skating hour  as a child  
gaining speed  and then a rust pocked curbside lightpost rotated toward her  also gaining speed  and the sound was somewhere
between a bonk and a clang  and the sky and the sidewalk switched places  and a violet sun exploded outward  and the whole
street turned violet and swung like a clanging bell  and then she was alone and purseless and watching the two recede  both
seeming to be shrieking for help 

   november year of the depend adult undergarment
a disadvantage of your nasally ingested cocaine being that at a certain point somewhere past the euphoric crest   if you
haven t got the sense left to stop and just ride the crest  and instead keep going  nasally   it takes you into regions of almost
interstellar cold and nasal numbness  randy lenz s sinuses were frozen against his skull  numb and hung with crystal frost  his
legs felt like they ended at the knees  he was trailing two very small sized chinese women as they lugged enormous paper
shopping bags east on bishop allen dr  under central  his heart sounded like a shoe in the ennet house basement s dryer  his
heart was beating that loud  the chinese women scuttled at an amazing rate  given their size and the bags  size  it was c           h   smack in the middle of the former interval of issues resolution  the chinese women didn t walk so much as scuttle with a
kind of insectile rapidity  and lenz was heart pressed to both keep up and seem to casually saunter  numb from the knee down and
the nostril back  they made the turn onto prospect st  two or a few blocks below central square  moving in the direction of inman
square  lenz followed ten or thirty paces behind  eyes on the twine handles of the shopping bags  the chinese women were about
the size of fire hydrants and moved like they had more than the normal amount of legs  conversing in their anxious and highpitched monkey language  evolution proved your orientoid tongues were closer to your primatal languages than not  at first  on
the brick sidewalks of the stretch of mass  ave  between harvard and central  lenz had thought they might be following him  
he d been followed a great deal in his time  and like the well read geoffrey d  he knew only too well thank you that the most
fearsome surveillance got carried out by unlikely looking people that followed you by walking in front of you with small mirrors
in their glasses 
temples or elaborate systems of cellular communicators for reporting to the command center   or else also by helicopters 
also  that flew too high to see  hovering  the tiny chop of their rotors disguised as your own drumming heart  but after he d had
success at successfully shaking the chinese women twice   the second time so successfully he d had to tear ass around through
alleys and vault wooden fences to pick them up again a couple blocks north on bishop allen dr   scuttling along  jabbering  
he d settled down in his conviction about who was trailing who  here  as in just who had the controlling discretion over the
general situation right here  the ejection from the house  which the ejection had at first seemed like the kiss of a death sentence 
had turned out to maybe be just the thing  he d tried the straight on narrow and for his pains had been threatened and
dismissively sent off  he d given it his best  and for the most part impressively  and he had been sent away  alone  and at least
now could openly hide  r  lenz lived by his wits out here  deeply disguised  on the amonymous streets of n  cambridge and
somerville  never sleeping  ever moving  hiding in bright lit and public plain sight  the last place they would think to find him 
lenz wore fluorescent yellow snowpants  the slightly shiny coat to a long tailed tux  a sombrero with little wooden balls
hanging off the brim  oversize tortoise shell glasses that darkened automatically in response to bright light  and a glossy black
mustache promoted from the upper lip of a mannequin at lechmere s in cambridgeside   the ensemble the result of bold snatchand sprints all up and down the nighttime charles  when he d first gone overground northeast from enfield several odd days back 
the absolute blackness of the mannequin s mustache   very securely attached with promoted krazy glue and made even glossier
by the discharge from a nose lenz can t feel running   gives his pallor an almost ghostly aspect in the sombrero s portable shade

   another both advantage and disadvantage of nasal cocaine is that eating becomes otiose and optional  and one forgets to for
extended periods of time  to eat   in his gaudy pastiche of disguise he passes easily for one of metro boston s homeless and
wandering mad  the walking dead and dying  and is given a wide berth by all comers  the trick  he s found  is to not sleep or eat 
to stay up and moving at all times  alert in all six directions at all times  heading for under the cover of t station or enclosed mall
whenever the invisible rotors  cardiac chop betrayed surveillance at altitude 
he d got quickly familiarized with little lisbon s networks of alleys and transoms and back trash lots  and its  dwindling 
population of feral cats and dogs  the area was fertile in overhead clocks of banks and churches  dictating movements  he carried
his browning x    serrated in its shoulder holster strapped inside his one sock just above the spats of the formal footwear he d
taken off the same a formal affair  ltd  sidewalk display as the tux s coat  his lighter was in a fluorescent zip uppable slash
pocket  quality trashbags were plentiful in dumpsters and land barges stopped at lights  the james principles of the gifford
lectures  its razored out recep tacled heart now quite a bit closer to empty than lenz would be comfortable thinking about
directly  he had in his hand tucked up under one formal arm  and the chinese women scuttled centipedishly abreast  their
mammoth shopping bags held in a right hand and left  respective  so the bags were side by side between them  lenz was closing
the gap behind them  but gradually and with no little nonchalant stealth  considering it was hard to walk stealthily when one
couldn t feel one s feet  and when one s eyeglasses darkened automatically whenever one went under a streetlight and then took
their time lightening up again  after  so that no less than two of lenz s vital sensory street senses were disorientated  but he still
managed both stealth and nonchalance both  he had no clue how he really looked  like many of the itinerant mad of metro
boston  he tended to confuse a wide berth with invisibility  the shopping bags looked heavy and impressive  their weight making
the chinese women lean in slightly toward each other  call it   l  loh  the chinese women and then lenz all passed a gray faced
woman squatting back between two dumpsters  her multiple skirts hiked up  vehicles were packed bumper flush all along the
curb  with myriad double parking also  the chinese women passed a man lined up at the curb with a toy bow and arrows  and
when the glasses undarkened lenz could see him as well as he passed also   the guy wore a rat colored suit and was shooting a
suction cup arrow at the side of a for lease building and then going up and drawing a miniature chalk circle on the brick around
the arrow  and then another circle around that circle  and etc   as in a what s the word  the women paid him no orientoid mind 
the suit s string tie was also brown in tone  unlike a rat s tail  his wall s chalk was more pinkish  one of the women said
something high pitched  like an exclamation to the other  your monkey languages  exclamatories have an explosive ricocheting
sound to them  as in a component of boing to every word  a window up across the street was producing the star spanned
banner all this time  the man had a string tie and fingerless little gloves  and he stepped back from the wall to examine his pink
circles and almost collided with lenz  and they both looked at each other and shook their heads like look at this poor son of an
urban bitch i m on the same street with 
it was universally well known that your basic orientoid types carried their earthly sum total of personal wealth with them at
all times  as in on their person while they scuttled around  the orientoid religion prohibited banks  and lenz had seen mammoth
double width twine handled shopping bags in too many tiny chinese women s hands not to have deducted that the chinese female
species of oriental used shopping bags to carry their personal wealth  he felt the energy required for the snatch and sprint
increasing now with each stride  drawing nonchalantly closer  able now to distinguish different patterns in the clear like plastic
flags they wrapped their little hair in  the chinese women  his heartrate speedened to a steady warming gallop  he began to feel
his feet  adrenaline about what would shortly occur dried his nose and helped his mouth stop moving around on his face  the
frightful hog was not and never numb  and now it stirred in the snowpants slightly with excitement of wits and the thrill of the
hunt  far from cutting edge surveillance  the shoe was on the other foot  the unwitting oriental women had no idea who they were
dealing with  behind them  no idea he was back there surveilling them and closing the nonchalant gap  stumbling only slightly
after each streetlight s light  he was in total control of this situation  and they did not even know there was a situation  bull s eye 
lenz straightened the mustache with one finger and gave a tiny little yellow brick road stutter skip of pure controlling glee  his
adrenaline invisible for all to see 
there were two ways of going  and les assassins des fauteuils rollents were prepared to pursue both these  less better was
the indirect route  surveillance and infiltrating the surviving associates of the entertainment s au teur  its actress and rumored
performer  relatives   if necessary  taking them and subjecting them to technical interview  leading with hope to the original
auteur s cartridge of the entertainment  this had risks and exposures and was held abeyant until the directer route   to locate and
secure a master copy of the entertainment on their own   had been exhausted  it was this way that thus they were now still here 
in the antitois  shop of cambridge  to   comme on dit   be turning all the stones 

   november year of the depend adult undergarment
the secret to sprinting in high heels  poor tony krause knew  was to run on one s toes  inclined way forward  with so much
forward momentum that one stayed well up on her toes and the heels never came into play  evidently the wretched creature
behind him knew this trade secret too  they careered up prospect  the creature s clutching hand just mm  away from the trailing
boa  poor tony held the two purses together tucked away against his side like a football in u s  football  pedestrians moved
artfully aside  long practiced  poor tony saw the pedestrians  faces very clearly as his odor preceded him like a shock wave  a
man in a car coat made a smell face and did a kind of artful veronica to let the two of them career past  poor tony s breath came in
great ragged stitchy gasps  he had not banked on victim pursuit  he felt the creature s hand grope for purchase on the remains of
his boa  the donegal cap flew off and was not mourned  the thing s own breathing was also ragged  but the obscenities she
hurled still came from the diaphragm  with conviction and vigor  the other thing had impacted a pole with a meaty sound tony
had shuddered to hear  his own father had struck himself about the head and shoulders as he grieved for his symbolically dead
son  the moment after the impact and the strap gave way  tony was up on his toes and in full flight  not banking on pursuit from
the other one  this black creature screaming and just off his tail  for the first couple blocks the creature had shouted for help and
to stop the bitch  and poor tony  then with a decent lead  had countered by also yelling help  and for god s sake stop her 
flummoxing any would be citizens  an ancient trade device among harvard square crews  but now the black creature had closed

 to within mm   and now it had real hold of the boa as they careered breathing at full speed on their toes  and krause unlooped the
thing from his neck with a flourish and sacrificed the boa to the thing  but the loathsome creature s hand came right back 
clutching at the air just over his leather collar  its ragged breath in his ear  cursing him  poor tony grieved in mid stride at the
thought that the thing had doubtless just tossed the boa carelessly aside into the street or gutter  their shoes  toes formed complex
and variable rhythms on the pavement  sometimes their footfalls were in sync  then they were not  the thing stayed agonizingly
just behind  bold print signs for fresh killed chicken and complete destruction flashed past  antitoi
entertainment was just over two long north south blocks distant  krause and pursuer both jay ran through a gridlocked
intersection  poor tony shouted help  and please  the hand and hissed breath just behind him was like one of those simply horrid
dreams where something unimaginable is chasing you for km  after km  and just before its talons close on the back of your collar
you wake up sitting bolt upright  except this horrid creature s clutching hand just behind him scenario went on and on  storefront
and curb and leaping pedestrians all melting together at the periphery due right  antitoi ent  s discreet back door was accessible by
a parking alley that cut west off prospect just before broadway and went west to intersect a smaller and dumpster lined northsouth alley  one of whose dumpsters  in which poor tony had occasionally slept  when out late and short of train fare  was within
underhand toss distance of the canadian brothers  rear exit  poor tony  purses under arm and the other hand clamped tight to the
wig  calculated that if he could get a reasonable lead on the creature by the time they hit the smaller alley the dumpsters would
keep it from seeing just which hopefully unlocked rear door p t  sought basic human kindly refuge behind  he feinted around a
bodega s sidewalk fruit display and shot a quick look back  hoping the creature would crash itself ass over teakettle into the
stacked fruit  it did not  it was still right there  breathing  its stutter step around two cardboard tiers of cape cranberries was
discouragingly deft  this thing had all too clearly chased persons before  its breath had a ragged implacability about it  it was all
too clearly in this for the long haul  it was no longer shouting stop or gutterish obscenities  poor tony s breaths felt flamish  it
sounded as if he were weeping  almost  he tried to shout help  and could not  he hadn t the breath to spare  black specks floated
upward through his vision  only certain of the streetlamps worked  his heartbeat was zuckungzuckungzuckung  poor tony hurdled
a queerly placed cardboard display for something wheelchaired and heard the creature vault it also and land lightly on its toes  its
uppers were not straps and could not dig like the fine aigners  tony felt blood on his feet  the entrance to the parking alley west
was between a tax preparer s and something else  it was right around here  krause squinted  the black specks were tiny rings with
opaque centers and floated upward through his sight like balloons  lazily  poor tony was post seizure  infirm  not to mention
withdrawn  his breath came in stitches and half sobs  he could barely stay on his toes  he had not consumed food since before the
library s men s room stall  which was how many days  he scanned the blurred storefronts ripping past  an elderly person went
down with a noise as the creature stiff armed him  somewhere a rape whistle blew  the tax preparer s had the odd storefront
announcement on parle le por tugais ici  its hand s finger knocked the rim of tony s leather collar with each footfall
until it moved up and poor tony could feel its fingers in the hair of the chignon he held clamped to his head with a hand  poor
tony s father used to come home to     mount auburn street watertown at the completion of a long day of cesareans and sit in a
chair in the darkening kitchen  scratching at his head where his mask s green strings had dug into the head  its doubtlessly luridly
long nailed fingers were twining for purchase in his wig s hair when they hit the preparer s and tony cut a sharp right  breaking a
heel on the pivot but gaining several steps toward a lead as the creature s momentum carried it past the alley s recessed mouth 
krause whimpered raggedly and flew west  up on his bloody toes  hearing his breath off both alley walls  negotiating broken glass
and the homeless supine  hearing it back behind him several steps crying a tight echoed stop motherfucking stop   with a supine
person krause vaulted lifting a decayed head from the alley floor to counter with  go

they had traced through the regrettably fatal technical interview of the young burglar       whose electrical surge tolerance
proved considerably lower than that of his room s computer s machinery   having traced their best chances at a copy to the
hapless antitois  establishment  it had taken the a f r  then several days to find it there  the real entertainment 
a f r  s u s a  cell s leader  fortier  the son of a glen almond glass blower  had allowed none of the mirrors to be broken or
dismantled  in all other respects  the search had been methodical and thorough  it was a neat search and also orderly  with time
taken  because the viewer of the shop was visually dysfunctional  a consumer tp had been purchased and set up for volunteer
viewing in the room of storage off the shop s back room  each cartridge of the shop s exhaustive shelves was sampled by a
volunteer  then discarded in one of the huge metal coffre d amas in the alley outside the shop s rear door  a detail had been
assigned to roll the extinguished antitoi brothers in construction plastic and place them in a room of storage off the back room 
this was for hygienic purposes  a detail also had procured an oilskin windowshade for the front door s glass  also some printed
signs which read closed  ropas  and relache  no person had knocked at the door after the first hours  thus 
quickly  on the first day  in a liquor box which was damp and smelled  they had found an example of the rival f l q  s
tactical street display cartridges  with its crudely stamped smiling face and the  il ne faut plus qu on pursuive le bonheur 
embossed upon it  and young tassigny  with characteristic valor  volunteered to be rolled into the room of storage and strapped
in  in order to verify this  and fortier allowed this  all had drunk the gesture of a toast to tassigny and promised to look after his
aged father and fur traps  and m  fortier had embraced the young volunteer and kissed both his face s cheeks as he was rolled in
and fitted by m  broullime with eeg wires and strapped in before the viewer placed in the room of storage 
then the cartridge of the street display turned out to be blank  void  then another from this box  also wet  also blank  two
blanks  done  d accord  fortier  philosophical  counselled against disappointment or damage from a frustration   he and marathe
had counselled all along that the f l q  displays of the entertainment and the wheelchaired man were probably the hoax  instilling
of terror only  the fact of the displays which featured wheelchairs  a smack to the testicles of a f r    this was ignored  a f r 
wanted only to repossess this copy of the entertainment  as well  chiefly  now to determine  could this copy of duplessis itself be
copied  this was the real objective  a master cartridge        unlike the f l q   les assassins des fauteuils rollents had no
interest in blackmail or cartographic extortings for the convexity s return  not in re reconfiguration of o n a n  or even its
charter s dissolution  the a f r  were interested only in dealing the sort of testicular frappe to the underbelly of u s a  selfinterests that would render canada itself unwilling to face the u s a  retaliation for this   if a f r  could secure  copy  and
disseminate the entertainment  quebec would be not so much allowed as required by ottawa to secede  to face on its own the

 wrath of a neighbor struck down by its own inability to say  now  to fatal pleasures       
fortier bid the a f r  methodically to continue the search  younger volunteers were rolled into the room of storage on a
rotating basis to sample each set of cartridges  aside from some bickering over the portuguese pornography  the rotation
proceeded with valor and care  the plastic wrapped cadavers began to swell  but the plastic maintained hygienic conditions adequately for viewing samples of the many cartridges in the room of storage  the search and inventory proceeded in a painstaking
and slow fashion 
m  fortier was required to absent himself for a period  in the search s middle  to help facilitate southwest ops  the infiltration
of that relative of the auteur felt most strongly  according to marathe  to have knowledge or possession of a duplicable copy 
there was reason to think m  duplessis had received his original copies from this relative  an athlete  marathe felt u s b s s  felt
this person may have borne responsibility for the razzles and dazzles of berkeley and boston  u s a  the americans  fieldoperative  jutting with prostheses  had been clinging to this person like a bad odor

standing upon legs  fortier owned attachable legs of flesh tone polymer resins whose interior circuitry was responsive to largebundle neural stimuli from his stumps  which with metal crutches whose bracelets locked to his wrists allowed a sort of swirling
parody of perambulation  but fortier  he rarely wore the prostheses  not in u s a   and never for public transit  he preferred the
condescension  the pretense of institutional  sensitivity  to his  right  of the  equal access   it honed the edge of his senses of

after so long not caring  and then now the caring crashes back in and turns so easily into obsessive worry  in sobriety  a few
days before the debacle in which don gately got hurt  joelle had begun to worry obsessively about her teeth  smoking  base
cocaine eats teeth  corrodes teeth  attacks the enamel directly  chandler foss had explained all this to her at supper  showing her
his corroded stumps  in her latin cloth purse now she carried a traveller s brush and expensive toothpaste with alleged enamelrevitalizers and anti corrosives  several of the ennet house residents who d hit bottom with the glass pipe had no teeth or
blackened and disintegrating teeth  the sight of wade mcdade s or chandler foss s teeth gave joelle the fantods like nothing at
meetings could  the toothpaste was only recently available over the counter and was a whole level of power and expense above
standard smoker s polish 
as she lies on her side beside kate gompert s empty bunk  her veil s selvage tucked secure between pillow and jaw  and
charlotte treat also asleep across the lit room  joelle dreams that don gately  unhurt and mid south accented  is ministering to
her teeth  he is bibbed in dental white  humming softly to himself  his big hands deft as he plucks instruments from the gleaming
chair side tray  her chair is dental and canted back  yielding her face up to him  her legs shut tight and stretching up and out
before her  dr  don s eyes are abstractly kind  concerned for her teeth  and his thick fingers  as he inserts things to hold her open 
are gloveless and taste warm and clean  even the light seems sterilely clean  there is no assistant  the dentist is solo  leaning in
above her  humming absent chords as he probes  his head is massive and vaguely square  in the dream she is concerned for her
teeth and feels gately shares her concern  she feels good that he makes no chitchat and probably doesn t know her name  there s
very little eye contact  he is completely intent on her teeth  he is there to help if possible  is his whole demeanor s message  his
bib hangs by a necklace of tiny steel balls and could not be whiter  his head haloed with a strap and a polished metal disk attached
to the strap just above his eyes  a tiny mirror of stainless steel  clean as the instruments  tray  and the dream s yielding and trustful
quality of calm is undercut only by the view of her face in the halo s mirror  the disk like a third eye in gately s broad clean
forehead  because she can see her face  convexly distorted and ravaged by years of cocaine and not caring  her face all bug eyes
and sunken cheeks  lampblack smudges beneath the pop eyes  and as the dentist s warm thick fingers gently draw her lips back
she looks up into his head s mirror at long rows of all canine teeth  tapered and sharp  with then more rows of canines behind
them  in reserve  the countless rows of the teeth are all sharp and strong and unblackened but tinged at the tips with an odd kind
of red  as of old blood  the teeth of a creature that carelessly tears at meat  these are teeth that have been up to things she hasn t
known about  she tries to say around the fingers  the dentist hums  probing  in the dream joelle looks up into don gately s
forehead s dental mirror s disk and is seized with a fear of her teeth  a terror  and as her spread mouth spreads farther to cry out in
fear all she can see in the little round mirror are endless red stained rows of teeth leading back and away down a pitch black pipe 
and the image of all these rows of teeth in the disk blots out the big dentist s good face as he probes with a hook and says he
assures her that these can be saved 
then  by the time fortier was able to return to the dismantled shop  they had located a third cartridge emblazed with the
embossed smile and letters disclaiming need of happy pursuit  and  after some regretful losses  they had secured and verified it 
the samizdat cartridge of entertainment burglared from the death of duplessis 
fortier was told the story  the cell s young desjardins had been taking his turn in the viewing rotation  seated with young
tassigny in the room of storage during the hours of early morning  sampling the dregs of unshelved entertainments found in
kitchen can waste bags in the same closet the anti tois  cadavers were swelling within  desjardins had just moments before
complained of the wasted time of cartridges scheduled for the coffre d amas 
tassigny  who had been in the room of storage with desjardins  then was saved by the need to leave this room to change the
bag of his partial colos tomy  but  marathe reported  they had lost desjardins  and the older and valued joubet also  who rolled
against orders into the room of storage to see why desjardins had not been sending out the tapes for more tapes to sample  both
were lost  they had not lost more only because someone had thought to wake up broullime  whom fortier had briefed with care
on procedures for if the actual entertainment was found by this viewing  but two were lost   joubet the red bearded workhorse 
who loved to pop wheelies  and young desjardins  so filled with the idealism and so young as to be still feeling the phantom pains
in his stumps  remy marathe reported that the two had been made comfortable since their loss  allowed to remain in the locked
room of storage and view the entertainment again and again  silent behind the door except when the watch detail reported the

 hearing of cries of impatience at the player s rewinder  to rewind  marathe reported they had declined to come out for water or
food  or joubet   who was diabetique   for his insulin  m  broullime estimated that it would be a matter of hours now for
joubet  perhaps maybe one day or two days for desjardins  fortier had sadly said  bof and acceptingly shrugged  all knew the
sacrifices that might have been required  all viewing details had taken their chances at random in the rotation of viewing 
on fortier s return  marathe delivered also the expected bad news of the finding of it  there was no need yet for high rpm
hardware of duplication  the found copy was read only       
philosophical  fortier reminded the a f r  that they did now encouragingly know the entertainment of such power did truly
exist  for themselves  and could thus gird their courage and fortitude for the more indirect task of forfeiting hopes of securing a
master copy and instead striving to secure the original master  the auteur s own cartridge  from which all read only copies had
presumably been copied 
thus  he said  now the more arduous and risky task of taking for technical interview known persons associated with the
entertainment and locating the original maker s duplicable master copy  none of this would have been worthy of the risk had they
not now determined  through the heroic sacrifices of joubet and desjardins  that the device for extending o n a n  s selfdestructing logic to its final conclusion lay within their arduous grasp 
fortier gave numerous orders  the platoon of a f r  remained in the closed anritoi entertainent shop  behind their lingual
window shade  surveillance on the hated f l q  s bureau centrale  in the poorly disciplined house on allston s rue de brainerd  
this was suspended  the a f r  personnel pulled in and relocated to this commandeered inman square shop  where fortier and
marathe and m  broullime coordinated phases of activity in this next more arduous and indirect phase  and reviewed tactics also 
the deceased auteur s colleagues and relations were under consistent surveillance  their concentration of place worked in the
favor of this  an employee at the academy of tennis of enfield had been recruited and joined the canadian instructor and student
already inside for closer work of surveillance  in the desert  the redoubtable mile  luria p      was winning necessary confidences
with her usual alacrity  an expensive source in the subject s former department of the m i t  university had reported the entertainment s probable performer s last known employment   the small cambridge radio station which marathe and beausoleil
had pronounced weee   where she had donned the defacing veil of o n a n ite deformity 
attentions were to be focused on the cartridge s performer and on the academy of tennis of the auteur s estate  the fact that
the players of the academy were to play a provincially selected team from quebec would have been easier to exploit had the
a f r  possessed a tennis player of talent and lower extremities  inquiries into the composition and travel of the quebecois team
were under way from sources at home in papineau 
on the day of fortier s return also  the performer s radio program s technical engineer of radio had been acquired in a public
but low risk operation whose success had raised hopeful spirits for the acquisitions of more directly related persons to the
entertainment in this next phase  this person of u s a  radio had divulged all he professed to know under the mere descriptive
threat of technical interview procedures  marathe  the best lay judge of americans  veracity which the cell possessed  believed the
veracity of the engineer  but nevertheless a formal technical interview had proceeded  justified in order to verify  the young and
eruption studded person s report remained consistent two levels past average u s a  endurance  the only variance involving
several curious claims that the massachusetts institute of technology was defensive in bed 
today  fortier himself  and marathe  young balbalis  r  ossowiecke   all those with the better english   were thus now
therefore making the rounds of all substance difficulty rehabilitation facilities in hospitals  psychiatric institutions  and demimaisons within a    km  radius  procedures for expanding the radius of inquiry by factors of two and three had been preformulated  teams assembled  lines rehearsed  joubet and then desjardins had succumbed and been transported north by van as
well with the remains of the antitois  remains  the u s a  student radio engineering person  the veracity of whose limited
statements of the subject s whereabouts broullime had verified to within           of assurance well before debriefing levels
incompatible with physical existence  had been allowed several hours to recover  then had become of service as the a f r  s first
subject in field tests of the samizdat cartridge s motivational range  the room of storage again was utilized for this  his head
immobilized with some straps  the test subject had viewed the entertainment twice at gratis  without the application of any
motivational inquiry  for inquiry into the degree of motivation the cartridge will induce  m  broullime had rolled himself
blindfolded into the room of storage holding an orthopedic saw and informed the subject of the test that  as of beginning now 
each subsequent reviewing of the entertainment now would have the price of one digit from the subject s extremities  and handed
the subject the orthopedic saw in question  also  broullime s explanation to fortier was that thus a matrix could be created to
compute the statistical relation between  n  the number of times the subject replayed the entertainment and  t  the amount of time
he took to decide and remove a digit for each subsequent  n     viewing  the goal was to confirm with statistical assurance the
subject s desire for viewing and reviewing as incapable of satiation  there could be no index of diminishing satisfaction as in the
econometrics of normal u s a  commodities  for the samizdat entertainment s allure to be macro politically lethal  the ninth digit
of extremities had to come off as quickly and willingly as the second  broullime  personally he had some skepticism about this 
but this was broullime s function in his role in the cell  expertise in combination with skepticism de coeur 
and then naturally also a wider range of field test subjects would then be required  to verify that this subject s responses
were not merely subjective and typical only of a certain sensibility of entertainment consumer  the bus window yielded a faint
and ghostly reflection of fortier  and  through that faint view  the lights of urban life outside the bus  somerville massachusetts
u s a  s phoenix house administrative person had listened to fortier s delivery with shows of great compassion  then explained
with patience that they were unable to admit addicted persons for whom english was the secondary language  d  accord  though
he was pretending disappointment  fortier had been able to see the admitted addicts of phoenix house holding a gathering in the
room of living outside the office door  no person among them wore a veil of facial concealment  and so c est  a  four small teams
were at this moment rolling through the streets and small streets and alleys of the unpleasant district of the antitoi establishment 
for the purpose of acquiring additional subjects for m  broullime for the time when the subject s digits were expended  the
subjects for suitability had to be passively undefended enough to be acquired publicly with quiet  yet not damaged in the brains or
under the influence of the many of the district s intoxicant compounds  the a f r  were highly trained in patience and to be
disciplined 

 the southbound bus  empty and  which he detested  fluorescently lit  climbs a thin hill off winter park  north cambridge 
heading for the squares inman and central  fortier looks out at the lights passing  he can smell snow coming  it soon will snow 
he sees in his imagination two thirds of nne s largest urban city inert  sybaritically entranced  staring  without bodily movement 
home bounded  fouling their divans and the chairs which may recline  he sees the district of business s towers of buildings and
luxury apartments striated as two of every three floors is darkened to lightless black  with here and there the vaguely blue flicker
of expensive digital entertainment equipment flickering through darkened windows  he imagines m  tine holding the hand
holding the pen of president j  gentle as the o n a n ite president signs declaring war  he imagines teacups clinking thinly
beneath trembling hands in the interior sanctums of ottawa s sanctum of power  he adjusts his sportcoat s lapel over his sweater
and smooths the wiry hair that tends to bulge unsmoothly around the bare spot  he watches the back of the bus driver s neck as the
driver stares straight ahead 
sure enough the chinkette women had been strengthless and lightweight  flew aside like dolls  and their bags were indeed
treasure heavy  hard to heft  but as lenz cut left down the north south alley he could hold the bags by their twine handles out
slightly before him  so their weight s momentum kind of pulled him along  the cruciform alleys through the blocks between
central and inman in little lisbon were a kind of second city  lenz ran  his breath came easy and he could feel himself from
scalp to sole  green and green with red dumpsters lined both walls and made the going narrow  he vaulted two sitting figures in
khaki sharing a can of sterno on the alley floor  he glided through the foul air above them  untouched by it  the sounds behind
him were his footfalls  echo off dumpsters and fire escapes  iron  his left hand ached nicely from holding both a bag s handle and
his large print volume  a dumpster up ahead had been hitched to an e w d  truck and just left to sit  probably quitting time  the
empire guys had an incredible union  in the recess of the hitch s bar a small blue light flickered and died  this was a dozen
dumpsters up ahead  lenz slowed to a brisk walk  his topcoat had slipped slightly off one of his shoulders but he had no free hand
to fix it and wasn t going to take time to put a bag down  his left hand felt cramped  it was somewhere vague between      and
    h  the alley was dark as a pocket  a tiny crash off somewhere south down the network of alleys was actually poor tony
krause rolling the steel waste barrel that tripped up ruth van cleve  the tiny blue flame came on  hung still  flickered  moved 
hung there  went back out  its glow was dark blue against the back of the huge e w d  truck  empire trucks were unstoppable 
hitches were valuable but locked down with a kryptonite device thing you needed welding stuff to cut through  from the recess of
the hitch there were small sounds  when the lighter lit again lenz was almost on them  two boys on the hitch and two squatting
down by the hitch facing them  four of them  a fire escape s pull ladder distended like a tongue and hanging just above them 
none of the boys was over like twelve  they used a m  fizzy bottle instead of a pipe  and the smell of burnt plastic hung mixed
with the sicksweet smell of overcarbonated rock  the boys were all small and slight and either black or spic  greedily hunching
over the flame  they looked ratty  lenz kept them in peripheral view as he strode briskly by  carrying his bags  spine straight and
extruding dignified purpose  the lighter went out  the boys on the hitch eyed lenz s bags  the squatting boys turned their heads
to look  lenz kept them in peripheral view  none of them wore watches  one of them wore a knit cap and watched steadily  he
locked eyes with lenz s left eye  made a gun of his thin hand  pretended to draw a slow bead  like performing for the others  lenz
walked by with urban dignity  like he both saw them and didn t  the smell was intense but real local  of the rock and bottle  he
had to veer out to miss the empire truck s side mirror on its steel strut  he heard them say things as the truck s grille fell behind 
and unkind laughter  and then something called out in a minority agnate he didn t know  he heard the lighter s flint  he thought to
himself assholes  he was looking for someplace empty and a bit more lit  to go through the bags  and cleaner than this one northsouth alley here  which smelled of ripe waste and rotting skin  he would separate the bags  valuables from the nonvaluables and
transfer the valuables to a single bag  he would fence the nonnegotiable valuables in little lisbon and refill the receptacle in his
medical dictionary  and buy some attractiver shoes  the alley was devroid of cats and rodents both  he did not stop to reflect why 
a rock or bit of brick courtesy of the junior crack jockeys back there landed behind him and skittered past and rang out against
something  and someone cried out aloud  a sexless figure lying back against a maybe duffel bag or pack against a dump ster  its
hand moving furiously in its groin and its feet pointed out into the alley and turned out like a dead body s  its shoes two different
shoes  its hair a clotted mass around its face  looking up over at lenz going past in the faint start of light from a broader alley s
intersection ahead  chanting softly what lenz could hear as he stepped gingerly over the rot smelling legs as  pretty  pretty  pretty  
lenz whispered to himself  jesus what a lot of fucked up ass eating fucking losers  
 our cult burned money for fuel  
 as in like currency  
 we used ones  the semi divine one advocated thrift  we d bring them to him at the stove  there was one stove  we had to
bring them to him on our knees with no part of our feet could touch the floor  he sat by the stove in our blankets and fed it ones 
we got an extra slap if the currency was new  
 as in like crisp and new  
 it was a cleansing  somebody always played a drum  
 our cult s divinely chosen leader drove a rolls  in neutral  we pushed him wherever he was called to like be at  he never
turned it on  the rolls  i got all muscled up  
 in summer then they made us slither on our bellies  we had to embrace our snake nature  it was a cleansing  
 as in like slithering  
 serious slithering  they took wire and bound our arms and legs  
 at least your wire wasn t barbed  
 i finally felt too cleansed to stay  
 meaning over pure  i can i d  totally  
 it was too much love somehow to take  
 i m like feeling the identification all over  this is   
 plus i was up to three bags a day  at the end  
 and then our divinely chosen s love squads made us chop wood with our teeth when it got cold  as in like subzero
wintertime  

  yours let you keep your teeth  
 only the ones for gnawing  see  
 sheesh  
 just the ones for gnawing  
remy marathe sat veiled and blanket lapped in the much crowded living room evening of this ennet house drug and
alcohol recovery house  the last demi maison on his portion of the list for this day  the hills of upper enfield  they were de
i infere of difficulty  but the demi maison itself had a ramp  a person with authority was conducting interviews to fill some vacancies of recent time in the place s office  of which its locked door was visible from this sitting  marathe and others were invited
to sit in the living room with a cup of unpleasant coffee  urged to smoke if he liked  everyone else was smoking  the living room
smelled like an ashtray  and its ceiling was yellow like the fingers of long smokers  also the living room evening resembled an
anthill which had been stirred with a stick  it was too full of persons  all of them restless and loud  there were demi maison
patients viewing a cartridge of martial arts conflict  former patients and persons of the upper enfield area cohabiting on the
furniture  conversing  a damaged woman  also in a fauteuil de rollent like marathe  slumped inutile next to the cartridge s viewer 
while a male person of advanced pallor mimed the kicks and thrusts of martial arts at her motionless head  trying to force the
woman to twitch or cry out  also a man without hands and feet trying to negotiate the stairway  other persons  presumably
addicted  waiting in the room to seek admittance to the recovery house  the room was loud and hot  marathe could hear a person
who will seek admittance vomiting in the shrubberies just outside the window  marathe s chair was locked down next to a divan s
arm and directly before a window  the window  one could wish it was open more than a crack  he felt  upon the dull colored
carpet a tormented appearing man scuttling like the crab while two hooligans in leather played a cruel game of jumping over him 
persons reading cartoon books and painting the nails of their extremities  a tall haired woman brought her foot to her mouth to
blow upon her toes  another young girl seemed to remove her eye from her head and placed it in her mouth  no other in the room
wore the veil of the entertainment s performer s organization u h i d  the smell of the u s a  cigarettes permeated his veil and
made marathe s eyes water  and he thought of vomiting also  two additional windows were open  but the room lacked all air 
during the time of his sitting  several persons approached marathe  but they would say to him only the whispers  pet the dogs 
or  make sure and pet the dogs   this idiomatic expression was not in marathe s knowledge of u s a  idiom 
also one person approached of a face whose skin seemed that it was rotting away from him in some way and asked him if he 
marathe  was court ordered 
marathe was one of few persons not smoking  he noted that none of the room s persons appeared to regard the cheesecloth
veil he wore over his face as unusual or curious or to be questioned  the old sportcoat he wore over a turtleneck sweater of
desjardin s made marathe more formally dressed than other of the applicants for treatment  two of the ennet house demi maison
current patients wore neckties  however  marathe kept pretending to sniff  he did not know why  he sat up next to a divan of false
velour at whose end beside him two women who had sought previous treatment of addiction in religious cults were meeting and
speaking together of their unenjoyable existences when in cults 
to whomever approached  marathe carefully recited the introductory lines he and m  fortier quickly had developed   good
night  i am addicted and deformed  seeking residential treatment for addiction  desperately   persons  responses to his introductory
lines were difficult to interpret  one of the older two men in neckties who had approached  he had clapped a hand to his soft face s
cheek and responded  how extraordinarily nice for you   in which marathe could detect sarcasm  the two women of cult
experience were inclined closely toward each other upon the divan  they touched each other s arms several times in a kind of
excitement as they conversed  when they laughed in delight they seemed to chew at the air  one s laughter involved also a
snorting noise  a clatter and two shrieks  these came from one end of the dining room  in the demi maison s floor plans a large
kitchen 
the sounds were then followed by a roiling cloud of steam  with repeated obscenities from unseen persons  a bald large black
man in a white cotton undershirt s laughing became coughing that would not cease  the two patients in neckties and the girl whose
eye could be removed spoke together intensively and also audibly at the end of one other divan 
 but consider this quality of portability with respect to  say  a car  is a car portable  with respect to a car it s more as though
i m portable  
 they re portable when they re on one of them semis where they got new cars stacked on with prices in the windows like a
good couple dozen on them semis that swing all to fuck all over      and make you think the cars are going to start falling out all
over the road when you re wanting to try and pass  
the plump one who had been ironic toward marathe  he was nodding   or  say  too  with respect to a tow truck or wrecker  if
you suffer a breakdown  one might be in a position to say that a deactivated car can be quote portable  but that with respect to a
functional car it is i who am portable  
the girl s nod caused the particular eye to wheel queasily in the socket of it  til buy that  day  
 if we re jot and titiling with all possible precision regarding portable  that is  
the other man continually rubbed at his shine of the shoes with a facial tissue  causing his necktie to touch the floor 
these conversers formed this triad on an unevenly sloped divan of leather colored plastic across the room  which was now
more airless yet from the roiling steam from the kitchen  infiltrating  directly facing marathe in a yellow chair against the wall by
these conversers  divan most directly across the living room from marathe was an addicted man waiting for seeking treatment by
admission  this one  he appeared to have several cigarettes burning at one time  he held a metal ashtray in his lap and jiggled the
boot of his crossed leg with vigor  for marathe  it was not difficult to ignore the fact that the addicted man was glaring at him  he
noted it  and did not understand because of what the man glared  but he was unconcerned  marathe was prepared to die violently at
any time  which rendered him free to choose among emotions  u s a  s b s s  s m  steeply had verified that u s a s did not
comprehend this or appreciate it  it was foreign to them  the veil allowed marathe the liberty of staring calmly back at the
addicted man without the man s knowledge  which marathe found he enjoyed  marathe felt sick to his body  from the smoky
room s smoke  marathe had once  as a child  with legs  bent himself over and overturned a decaying log in the forests of the lac
de deux montaignes region of his four limbed childhood  before le culte du prochain train        the pallor of the things

 which had writhed and scuttled beneath the wet log was the pallor of this addicted man  who wore a square of the facial hair
between lower lip and chin and had also a needle run through the flesh of the top of an ear  which the needle  it glistened and did
not glisten rapidly in succession as it vibrated with the jiggle of the jiggling boot  marathe gazed at him calmly through the veil
while rehearsing his prepared lines within his head  the more idiomatic would be that the needle jiggled sympathetically with the
jiggle of the boot  which was dull black and square heeled  the motorcycle boot of persons who did not own motorcycles but wore
the boots of those who did 
the addicted man rose slowly and carried the burning ashtray with him nearer to marathe  trying to kneel  his blue jeans of
levi      were strangely torn in spots with tattered white strings which showed the pallor of the knees  the torn holes had the size
and perimeter damage of holes that marathe recognized had been made by shotgun blasts of the high gauge  marathe was
mentally memorizing every detail of all things  for both his reports  the addicted man kneeling before him  he leaned in closer 
trying to remove something he believed was on his lip  close in  the expression that through the veil had appeared as glaring
corrected itself  the expression was more truly that the man s eyes had the vacant intensity of those who have violently died 
the man whispered   you real   marathe looked through the veil at his facial square   are you real   again the man whispered 
all the time leaning more and more in  slowly 
 you re real i can tell ain t you   the man whispered  quickly he looked behind him at the uproaring room before leaning once
more in   listen then  
marathe kept his hands calmly in his lap  his machine pistol bolstered securely to his right stump beneath the blanket  the
whispering man s searching fingers were leaving small bits of filth on the lip 
 s these poor fuckers    the man gestured slightly with indicating the room    most of them ain t real  so watch your six 
most of these fuckers are   metal people  
 i am swiss   marathe experimentally said  it was the second of his lines of introduction 
 walking around  make you think they re alive   the addicted man had the way with subtleness of looking all around himself
which marathe associated with intelligence professionals  one of his eyes had an exploded vein within it   but that s just the layer  
he said  he leaned in so far marathe could see pores through the veil   there s a micro thin layer of skin  but underneath  it s
metal  heads full of parts  under a organic layer that s micro thin   the eyes of men violently dead were also the eye of a fish in a
vendor s crushed ice  studying nothing  the man s smell suggested livestock on a hot day  a goatish  even through the smoke of the
room  trans   methyl   hexenoic acid was a material  m  broullime had lectured to pass times in long surveillances  a chemical
material in the sweat of grave mental illness  marathe  he had no trouble timing his breath so his exhalation matched the addicted
man s  who leaned more in 
 there s one way to tell   he said   get right up close  like right up flush next to  you can hear a whir  micro faint  this
whirring  it s the processors  gears  it s their flaw  machines always whir  they re good  they can quiet down the whir  
 i have no six  
 but they can t   can not   eliminate it  
t am swiss  seeking residential treatment with desperation  
 not under no micro thin tissue layer they can t   if the gaze were not vacant the gaze would be grim  frightened  marathe
distantly remembered the emotion fear 
 did you hear what she said   the ironic man on the divan laughed   potable means drinkable  it s not even the same root  did
you hear what she said  
the man s breath  it smelled of trans   methyl acid as well   i m clueing y in   he whispered   they re there to fool you  the
real ones of us re getting fooled  nine nine plus per cent of the time   the flesh of the knees through the holes in the blue jeans
was the white of long death   but you  i could tell you were real   he indicated the veil   no micro thin layer  the metal ones  
have faces   the smoke of his cigarette in the ashtray rose in a motion of corkscrewing   which this is why    feeling the lip  
 why the ones on the t or in the street   they won t let you right up close  try it  they ll never let you right up close  it s
programming  they know to look scared and   like   offended and back away and move to another seat  the real advanced
ones  they ll give you change  even  to let  em back off  try it  get right   up   like this   close   marathe sat calmly behind the
veil  feeling the veil move with the man s breath  waiting patiently to inhale  the women with experiences in cults had smelled the
odor of the man s trans   odor and relocated farther away upon the divan  the man s face smiled with one knowing side only of
his mouth  acknowledging their movement away  he was so close that the nose of him touched the veil when marathe finally
inhaled  marathe was prepared for death in all forms  the smells were trans   methyl   and of digested cheese and the under of an
arm  from the facial skin  marathe ignored impulses to impale the eyesockets with one two finger motion  the man had his hand
to his ear in a mime of to listen closely  his smile disclosed what might have once been teeth   nothing   he smiled   i knew  not a
sound  
 the swiss  we are a quiet people  and reserved  in addition  i am deformed  
the man waved his cigarette with impatience   listen up  this is why  you re how come i was here  i only thought it was the
habit  they can fool you   he scrubbed at the lip of his mouth   i m here to tell you  listen  you ain t here  
 i have emigrated from my native swiss  
still whispering   you ain t here  these fuckers are metal  us   us that are real   there s not many   they re fooling us 
we re all in one room  the real ones  one room all the time  everything s pro   jected  they can do it with machines  they pro

room and they   like   
the visible door of the locked office opened and an addicted patient emerged with a person in authority holding a clipboard 
the addicted patient limped and leaned far to a side  though was attractive in the blond stereotype of the u s a  image culture 
   change them  the thin organic layers  all the different people you know  so called  they re the same machines 
 physically challenged foreign person with unpronounceable name   the authority called with the clipboard 
 i am being indicated   marathe said  bending to release the clamps on his fauteuil s wheels 
   why i m in this pro   jection  to clue you  so that now you know  
marathe manipulated the fauteuil to the right with its trusty left wheel   i must be excused to plead for treatment  
 get right up close  
 good night   over his left shoulder  the inutile woman seemed to twitch slightly in her heavy fauteuil as he passed 
 you only think you re goin  someplace   the addicted man called  still one half kneeling 
marathe rolled up to the person in authority as slowly as possible  hunched deep into the sportcoat and pathetically tacking 
with significance  the large and clipboarded woman seemed without faze at the veil of u h i d  marathe extended a large hand in
greeting which he made tremble   good night  
the insane smelling man on the carpet called out after   make sure and pet the dogs  
joelle used to like to get really high and then clean  now she was finding she just liked to clean  she dusted the top of the
fiberboard dresser she and nell gunther shared  she dusted the oval top of the dresser s mirror s frame and cleaned off the mirror
as best she could  she was using kleenex and stale water from a glass by kate gompert s bed  she felt oddly averse to putting on
socks and clogs and going down to the kitchen for real cleaning supplies  she could hear the noise of all the post meeting
nighttime residents and visitors and applicants down there  she could feel their voices in the floor  when the dental nightmare tore
her upright awake her mouth was open to scream out  but the scream was nell g  down in the living room  whose laugh always
sounds like she s being eviscerated  nell preempted joelle s own scream  then joelle cleaned  cleaning is maybe a form of
meditation for addicts too new in recovery to sit still  the   woman s scarred wood floor had so much grit all over she could
sweep a pile of grit together with just an unappliqued bumper sticker she d won at b y p  then she could use damp kleenex to get
up most of the pile  she had only kate g  s little bedside lamp on  and she wasn t listening to any yyy tapes  out of consideration
for charlotte treat  who was unwell and missed her saturday night lively mtng  on pat s ok and was now asleep  wearing a
sleep mask but not her foam earplugs  expandable foam earplugs were issued to every new ennet resident  for reasons the staff
said would clarify for them real quick  but joelle hated to wear them   they shut out exterior noise  but they made your head s
pulse audible  and your breath sounded like someone in a space suit   and charlotte treat  kate gompert  april cortelyu  and
the former amy johnson had all felt the same way  april said the foam plugs made her brain itch 
it had started with orin incandenza  the cleaning  when relations were strained  or she was seized with anxiety at the
seriousness and possible im permanence of the thing in the back bay s co op  the getting high and cleaning became an important
exercise  like creative visualization  a preview of the discipline and order with which she could survive alone if it came to that 
she would get high and visualize herself solo in a dazzlingly clean space  every surface twinkling  every possession in place  she
saw herself being able to pick  say  dropped popcorn up off the rug and ingest it with total confidence  an aura of steely
independence surrounded her when she cleaned the co op  even with the little whimpers and anxious moans that exited her
writhing mouth when she cleaned high  the place had been provided nearly gratis by jim  who said so little to joelle on their first
several meetings that orin kept having to reassure her that it wasn t disapproval   himself was missing the part of the human
brain that allowed for being aware enough of other people to disapprove of them  orin had said   or dislike  it was just how the
mad stork was  orin had referred to jim as  himself or  the mad stork    family nicknames  both of which gave joelle the
creeps even then 
it d been orin who introduced her to his father s films  the work was then so obscure not even local students of serious film
knew the name  the reason jim kept forming his own distribution companies was to ensure distribution  he didn t become
notorious until after joelle d met him  by then she was closer to jim than orin had ever been  part of which caused part of the
strains that kept the brownstone co op so terribly clean 
she d barely thought consciously of any incandenzas for four years before don gately  who for some reason kept bringing
them bubbling up to mind  they were the second saddest family joelle d ever seen  orin felt jim disliked him to the precise extent
that jim was even aware of him  orin had spoken about his family at length  usually at night  on how no amount of punting
success could erase the psychic stain of basic fatherly dislike  failure to be seen or acknowledged  orin d had no idea how banal
and average his same sex parent issues were  he d felt they were some hideous exceptional thing  joelle d known her mother didn t
much like her from the first time her own personal daddy d told her he d rather take pokie to the pictures alone  much of the stuff
orin said about his family was dull  gone stale from years of never daring to say it  he credited joelle with some strange
generosity for not screaming and fleeing the room when he revealed the banal stuff  pokie had been joelle s family nickname 
though her mother d never called her anything but joelle  the orin she knew first felt his mother was the family s pulse and
center  a ray of light incarnate  with enough depth of love and open maternal concern to almost make up for a father who barely
existed  parentally  jim s internal life was to orin a black hole  orin said  his father s face any room s fifth wall  joelle had
struggled to stay awake and attentive  listening  letting orin get the stale stuff out  orin had no idea what his father thought or felt
about anything  he thought jim wore the opaque blank facial expression his mother in french sometimes jokingly called le
masque  the man was so blankly and irretrievably hidden that orin said he d come to see him as like autistic  almost catatonic 
jim opened himself only to the mother  they all did  he said  she was there for them all  psychically  she was the family s light
and pulse and the center that held tight  joelle could yawn in bed without looking like she was yawning  the children s name for
their mother was  the moms   as if there were more than one of her  his younger brother was a hopeless retard  orin had said 
orin recalled the moms used to tell him she loved him about a hundred times a day  it nearly made up for himself s blank stare 
orin s basic childhood memory of jim had been of an expressionless stare from a great height  his mother had been really tall 

 too  for a girl  he d said he d found it secretly odd that none of the brothers were taller  his retarded brother was stunted to about
the size of a fire hydrant  orin reported  joelle cleaned behind the filthy room s radiator as far as she could reach  being careful not
to touch the radiator  orin described his childhood s mother as his emotional sun  joelle remembered her own personal daddy s
uncle t s  talking about how her own personal daddy d thought his own momma  hung the god damn moon   he d said  the
radiators on ennet house s female side stayed on at all times            at first joelle had thought mrs  avril incandenza s highwatt maternal love had maybe damaged orin by bringing into sharper relief jim s remote self absorption  which would have
looked  by comparison  like neglect or dislike  that it had maybe made orin too emotionally dependent on his mother   why else
would he have been so traumatized when a younger brother had suddenly appeared  specially challenged from birth and in need of
even more maternal attention than orin  orin  late one night on the co op s futon  recalled to joelle his skulking in and dragging a
wastebasket over and inverting it next to his infant brother s special crib  holding a heavy box of quaker oats high above his head 
preparing to brain the needy infant  joelle had gotten an a  in developmental psych  the semester before  and also dependent
psychologically  orin  it seemed  or even metaphysically   orin said he d grown up  first in a regular house in weston and then at
the academy in enfield  grown up dividing the human world into those who were open  readable  trustworthy  v  those so closed
and hidden that you had no clue what they thought of you but could pretty damn well imagine it couldn t be anything all that
marvelous or else why hide it  orin had recounted that he d started to see himself getting closed and blank and hidden like that  as
a tennis player  toward the end of his junior career  despite all the moms s frantic attempts to keep him from hiddenness  joelle
had thought of b u  s nickerson field s        voices  openly roared endorsement  the sound rising with the punt to a kind of
amniotic pulse of pure positive noise  versus tennis s staid and reserved applause  it had all been so easy to figure and see  then 
listening  loving orin and feeling for him  poor little rich and prodigious boy   all this was before she came to know jim and the
work 
joelle scrubbed at the discolored square of fingerprints around the light switch until the wet kleenex disintegrated into
greebles 
never trust a man on the subject of his own parents  as tall and basso as a man might be on the outside  he nevertheless sees
his parents from the perspective of a tiny child  still  and will always  and the unhappier his childhood was  the more arrested will
be his perspective on it  she s learned this through sheer experience 
greebles had been her own mother s word for the little bits of sleepy goo you got in your eyes  corners  her own personal
daddy called them  eye boogers  and used to get them out for her with the twisted corner of his hankie 
though it s not as if you could trust parents on the subject of their memory of their children either 
the cheap glass shade over the ceiling s light was black with interior grime and dead bugs  some of the bugs looked like they
might have been from long extinct species  the loose grime alone filled half an empty carefree box  the more stubborn crud
would take a scouring pad and ammonia  joelle put the shade aside for until she d shot down to the kitchen to toss out different
boxes of crud and wet kleenex and grab some serious chore type supplies from under the sink 
orin had said she was the third neatnikest person he knew after his moms and a former player he d played with with
obsessive compulsive disorder  a dual diagnosis with which the u h i d  membership was rife  but at the time the import had
missed her  at that time it had never occurred to her that orin s pull toward her could have had anything either pro or con to do
with his mother  her biggest worry was that orin was pulled only by what she looked like  which her personal daddy d warned
her the sweetest syrup draws the nastiest flies  so to watch out 
orin hadn t been anything like her own personal daddy  when orin was out of the room it had never seemed like a relief 
when she was home  her own daddy never seemed to be out of the room for more than a few seconds  her mother said she hardly
even tried to talk to him when his pokie was home  he kind of trailed her around from room to room  kind of pathetically  talking
batons and low ph chemistry  it was like when she exhaled he inhaled and vice versa  he was all through the house  he was real
present at all times  his presence penetrated a room and outlasted him there  orin s absence  whether for class or practice  emptied
the co op out  the place seemed vacuumed and buffed sterile before the cleaning even started  when he went  she didn t feel
lonely in the place without him  but she did feel alone  what alone was going to feel like  and she  no one s fool        was
erecting fortifications real early into it 
it was orin  of course  who d introduced them  he d had this stubborn idea that himself would want to use her  in the work 
she was too pretty for somebody not to want to arrange  capture  better himself than some weak chinned academic  joelle d
protested the whole idea  she had a brainy girl s discomfort about her own beauty and its effect on folks  a caution intensified by
the repeated warnings of her personal daddy  even more to the immediate point  her filmic interests lay behind the lens  she d do
the capturing thank you very much  she wanted to make things  not appear in them  she had a student filmmaker s vague disdain
for actors  worst  orin s idea s real project was developmentally obvious  he thought he could somehow get to his father through
her  that he pictured himself having weighty  steeple fingered conversations with the man  joelle s appearance and performance
the subjects  a three way bond  it made her real uneasy  she theorized that orin unconsciously wished her to mediate between
himself and  himself   just as it sounded like his mother had  she was uneasy about the excited way orin predicted that his father
wouldn t be able to   resist using  her  she was extra uneasy about how orin referred to his father as  himself   it seemed painfully
blatant  developmental arrest wise  plus she felt   only a little less than she made it sound  on the futon at night  protesting  
she d felt uneasy at the prospect of any sort of connection with the man who had hurt orin so  a man so monstrously tall and cold
and remotely hidden  joelle heard a howl and a crash from the kitchen  followed by mcdade s tubercular laugh  twice charlotte
treat sat up in sleep  glistening with fever  and said in a flat dead voice something that sounded for all the world like  trances in
which she did not breathe   and then fell back  out  joelle was trying to pin down a queer rancid cinnamon smell that came from
the back of a closet stuffed with luggage  it was especially hard to clean when you weren t supposed to be allowed to touch any
other resident s stuff 
she might have known from the work  the man s work was amateurish  she d seen  when orin had had his brother   the
unretarded one   lend them some of the mad stork s read only copies  was amateurish the right word  more like the work of a
brilliant optician and technician who was an amateur at any kind of real communication  technically gorgeous  the work  with
lighting and angles planned out to the frame  but oddly hollow  empty  no sense of dramatic towardness   no narrative

 movement toward a real story  no emotional movement toward an audience  like conversing with a prisoner through that plastic
screen using phones  the upperclassman molly notkin had said of incandenza s early oeuvre  joelle thought them more like a very
smart person conversing with himself  she thought of the significance of the moniker  himself   cold  pre nuptial agreement of
heaven and hell   mordant  sophisticated  campy  hip  cynical  technically mind bending  but cold  amateurish  hidden  no risk
of empathy with the job like protagonist  whom she felt like the audience was induced to regard like somebody sitting atop a
dunk tank  the lampoons of  inverted  genres  archly funny and sometimes insightful but with something provisional about them 
like the finger exercises of someone promising who refused to really sit down and play something to test that promise  even as an
under grad joelle d been convinced that parodists were no better than camp followers in ironic masks  satires usually the work of
people with nothing new themselves to say         the medusa v  the odalisque    cold  allusive  inbent  hostile  the only
feeling for the audience one of contempt  the meta audience in the film s theater presented as objects long before they turn to blind
stone 
but there had been flashes of something else  even in the early oeuvre  before himself made the leap to narratively
anticonfluential but unironic melodrama she helped prolong the arc of  where he dropped the technical fireworks and tried to make
characters move  however inconclusively  and showed courage  abandoned everything he did well and willingly took the risk of
appearing amateurish  which he had   but even in the early work   flashes of something  very hidden and quick  almost furtive 
she noticed them only when alone  watching  without orin and his rheostat s dimmer  the living room s lights up high like she
liked them  liked to see herself and everything else in the room with the viewer   orin liked to sit in the dark and enter what he
watched  his jaw slackening  a child raised on multichannel cable tv  but joelle began   on repeated viewing whose original
purpose was to study how the man had blocked out scenes  for an advanced storyboard course she went the extra click in   she
began to see little flashes of something  the m v  o  s three quick cuts to the sides of the gorgeous combatants  faces  twisted past
recognition with some kind of torment  each cut to a flash of pained face had followed the crash of a petrified spectator toppling
over in her chair  three split seconds  no more  of glimpses of facial pain  and not pain at wounds   they never touched each
other  whirling with mirrors and blades  the defenses of both were impenetrable  more like as if what their beauty was doing to
those drawn to watch it ate them alive  up there on stage  the flashes seemed to suggest  but just three flashes  each almost
subliminally quick  accidents  but not one shot or cut in the whole queer cold film was accidental   the thing was clearly sboarded frame by frame  must have taken hundreds of hours  astounding technical anality  joelle kept trying to pause the
cartridge on the flashes of facial torment  but these were the early days of interlace cartridges  and the pause still distorted the
screen just enough to keep her from seeing what she wanted to study  plus she got the creepy feeling the man had upped the filmspeed in these few frame human flashes  to thwart just such study  it was like he couldn t help putting human flashes in  but he
wanted to get them in as quickly and unstudyably as possible  as if they compromised him somehow 
orin incandenza had been only the second boy ever to approach her in a male female way        the first had been shinychinned and half blind on everclear punch  an all kentucky lineman for the shiny prize biting shoats team back in shiny prize
ky  at a cookout to which the boosters had invited the pep and baton girls  and the lineman had looked like a little shy boy as he
confessed  by way of apologizing for almost splashing her when he threw up  that she was just too goddamn all petrifyingly
pretty to approach any other way but liquored up past all horror  the lineman d confessed the whole team s paralyzing horror of
the prettiness of varsity pep s top twirler  joelle  orin confessed to his private name for her  the memory of that h s  afternoon
remained real strong  she could smell the mesquite smoke and the blue pines and the yardguard spray  hear the squeals of the
stock they butchered and cleaned in symbolic prep for the opener against the n  paducah technical h s  rivermen  she could still
see the swooning lineman  wet lipped and confessing  keeping himself upright against an immature blue pine until the blue pine s
trunk finally gave with a snap and crash 
until that cookout and confession she d somehow thought it was her own personal daddy  somehow  discouraging dates and
male female approaches  the whole thing had been queer  and lonely  until she d been approached by orin  who made no secret of
the fact that he had balls of unrejectable steel where horrifyingly pretty girls were concerned 
but it wasn t even the subjective identification she felt  watching  she felt  somehow  for the flashes and seeming non seqs
that betrayed something more than cold hip technical abstraction  like e g  the     second motionless low angle shot of
gianlorenzo bernini s  ecstasy of st  teresa   which   yes   ground pre nuptial       dramatic movement to an annoying halt and
added nothing that a     or    second still shot wouldn t have added just as well  but on the fifth or sixth reviewing joelle started
to see the four minute motionless shot as important for what was absent  the whole film was from the alcoholic sandwich bag
salesman s pov        and the alcoholic sandwich bag salesman   or rather his head   was on screen every moment  even
when split screened against the titanic celestial marathon seven card stud with tarot cards game   his rolling eyes and temples 
dents and rosary of upper lip sweat was imposed nonstop on the screen and viewer       except for the four narrative minutes the
alcoholic sandwich bag salesman stood in the vittorio s bernini room  and the climactic statue filled the screen and pressed
against all four edges  the statue  the sensuous presence of the thing  let the alcoholic sandwich bag salesman escape himself  his
tiresome ubiquitous involuted head  she saw  was the thing  the four minute still shot maybe wasn t just a heavy art gesture or
audience hostile herring  freedom from one s own head  one s inescapable p o v   joelle started to see here  oblique to the point
of being hidden  an emotional thrust  since the mediated transcendence of self was just what the apparently decadent statue of the
orgasmic nun claimed for itself as subject  here then  after studious  and admittedly kind of boring  review  was an un ironic 
almost moral thesis to the campy abstract mordant cartridge  the film s climactic statue s stasis presented the theoretical subject as
the emotional effect   self forgetting as the grail   and   in a covert gesture almost moralistic  joelle thought as she glanced at
the room lit screen  very high  mouth writhing as she cleaned   presented the self forgetting of alcohol as inferior to that of
religion art  since the consumption of bourbon made the salesman s head progressively swell  horrendously  until by the film s end
its dimensions exceeded the frame  and he had a nasty and humiliating time squeezing it through the front door of the vittorio  
it didn t much matter once she d met the whole family anyhow  though  the work and reviewings were just an inkling  
usually felt on the small manageable bits of coke that helped her see deeper  harder  and so maybe not even objectively accessible
in the work itself  a lower belly intuition that the punter s hurt take on his father was limited and arrested and maybe unreal 
with joelle makeupless and stone sober and hair up in a sloppy knot  the introductory supper with orin and himself at legal

 seafood up in brookline       betrayed nothing much at all  save that the director seemed more than able to resist  using  joelle
in any capacity   she saw the tall man slump and cringe when orin told him the p g o a t  majored in f c       jim d told
her later she d seemed too conventionally  commercially pretty to consider using in any of that period s work  part of whose
theoretical project was to militate against received u s  commercial prettiness conventions   and that orin was so tense in
 himself  s presence that there wasn t room for any other real emotion at the table  orin gradually beginning to fill up silences with
more and faster nonstop blather until both joelle and jim were embarrassed at the fact that the punter hadn t touched his steamed
grouper or given anyone else space for a word of reply 
jim later told joelle that he simply didn t know how to speak with either of his undamaged sons without their mother s
presence and mediation  orin could not be made to shut up  and hal was so completely shut down in jim s presence that the
silences were excruciating  jim said he suspected he and mario were so easy with each other only because the boy had been too
damaged and arrested even to speak to until he was six  so that both he and jim had got a chance to become comfortable in mutual
silence  though mario did have an interest in lenses and film that had nothing to do with fathers or needs to please  so that the
interest was something truly to share  the two of them  and even when mario was allowed to work crew on some of jim s later
work it was without any of the sort of pressures to interact or bond via film that there d been with orin and hal and tennis  at
which jim  orin informed her  had been a late blooming junior but a top collegian 
jim referred to the work s various films as  entertainments   he did this ironically about half the time 
in the cab  that jim had hailed for them   on the way back home from legal seafood  orin had beaten his fine forehead
against the plastic partition and wept that he couldn t seem to communicate with himself without his mother s presence and
mediation  it wasn t clear how the moms mediated or facilitated communication between different family members  he said  but
she did  he didn t have one fucking clue how himself felt about his abandoning a decade s tennis for punting  orin wept  or about
orin s being truly great at it  at something  finally  was he proud  or jealously threatened  or judgmental that orin had quit tennis 
or what 
the   woman s room s mattresses were too skinny for their frames  and the rims of the frames between the slats were
appallingly clotted with dust  with female hair entwined and involved in the dust  so that it took one kleenex just to wet the stuff
down  several dry ones to wipe the muck out  charlotte treat had been too sick to shower for days  and her frame and slats were
hard to be near 
at joelle s first interface with the whole sad family unit   thanksgiving  headmaster s house  e t a   straight up comm 
ave  in enfield   orin s moms mrs  incandenza   please do call me avril  joelle   had been gracious and warm and attentive
without obtruding  and worked unobtrusively hard to put everyone at ease and to facilitate communication  and to make joelle feel
like a welcomed and esteemed part of the family gathering   and something about the woman made every follicle on joelle s
body pucker and distend  it wasn t that avril incandenza was one of the tallest women joelle had ever seen  and definitely the
tallest pretty older woman with immaculate posture  dr  incandenza slumped something awful  she d ever met  it wasn t that her
syntax was so artless and fluid and imposing  nor the near sterile cleanliness of the home s downstairs  the bathroom s toilet
seemed not only scrubbed but waxed to a high shine   and it wasn t that avril s graciousness was in any conventional way fake  it
took a long time for joelle even to start to put a finger on what gave her the howling fantods about orin s mother  the dinner
itself  no turkey  some politico familial in joke about no turkey on thanksgiving   was delicious without being grandiose 
they didn t even sit down to eat until     h  avril drank champagne out of a little fluted glass whose level somehow never went
down  dr  incandenza  no invitation to call him jim  she noticed  drank at a tri faceted tumbler of something that made the air
above it shimmer slightly  avril put everyone at ease  orin did credible impressions of famous figures  he and little hal made dry
fun of avril s canadian pronunciation of certain diphthongs  avril and dr  incandenza took turns cutting up mario s salmon 
joelle had a weird half vision of avril hiking her knife up hilt first and plunging it into joelle s breast  hal incandenza and two
other lopsidedly muscular boys from the tennis school ate like refugees and were regarded with gentle amusement  avril dabbed
her mouth in a patrician way after every bite  joelle wore girl clothes  her dress s neckline very high  hal and orin looked vaguely
alike  avril directed every fourth comment to joelle  to include her  orin s brother mario was stunted and complexly deformed 
there was a spotless doggie dish under the table  but no dog  and no mention was ever made of a dog  joelle noticed avril also
directed every fourth comment to orin  hal  and mario  like a cycle of even inclusion  there was new york white and albertan
champagne  dr  incandenza drank his drink instead of wine  and got up several times to freshen his drink in the kitchen  a
massive hanging garden behind avril s and hal s captains  chairs cut complex shadows into the uv light that made the table s
candles  glow a weird bright blue  the director was so tall he seemed to rise forever  when he rose with his tumbler  joelle had the
queerest indefensible feeling that avril wished her ill  she kept feeling different areas of hair stand up  everybody please andthank you d in a way that was sheer yankee wasp  after his second trip to the kitchen  dr  incandenza molded his twice baked
potatoes into an intricate futuristic cityscape and suddenly started to discourse animatedly on the      breakup of hollywood s
monolithic studio system and the subsequent rise of the method actors brando  dean  clift et al   arguing for a causal connection 
his voice was mid range and mild and devoid of accent  orin s moms had to be over two meters tall  way taller than joelle s own
personal daddy  joelle could somehow tell avril was the sort of female who d been ungainly as a girl and then blossomed and but
who d only become really beautiful later in life  like thirty five  she d decided dr  incandenza looked like an ecologically
poisoned crane  she told him later  mrs  incandenza put everyone at ease  joelle imagined her with a conductor s baton  she never
did tell jim that orin called him the mad or sad stork  the whole thanksgiving table inclined very subtly toward avril  very
slightly and subtly  like heliotropes  joelle found herself doing it too  the inclining  dr  incandenza kept shading his eyes from the
uv plant light in a gesture that resembled a salute  avril referred to her plants as her green babies  at some point out of nowhere 
little hal incandenza  maybe ten  announced that the basic unit of luminous intensity is the candela  which he defined for no one
in particular as the luminous intensity of           of a square meter of a cavity at the freezing temperature of platinum  all the
table s males wore coats and ties  the larger of hal s two tennis partners passed out dental stimulators  and no one made fun of
him  mario s grin seemed both obscene and sincere  hal  whom joelle wasn t crazy about  kept asking wasn t anybody going to ask
him the freezing temperature of platinum  joelle and dr  incandenza found themselves in a small conversation about bazin  a
film theorist himself detested  making a tormented face at the name  joelle intrigued the optical scientist and director by

 explaining ba zin s disparagement of self conscious directorial expression as historically connected to the neo thomist realism of
the  personalistes   an aesthetic school of great influence over french catholic intellectuals circa             many of bazin s
teachers had been eminent personalistes  avril encouraged joelle to describe rural kentucky  orin did a long impression of late
pop astronomer carl sagan expressing televisual awe at the cosmos  scale   billions and billions   he said  one of the tennis friends
burped just awfully  and no one reacted to the sound in any way  orin said  billions and billions and billions  in the voice of
sagan  avril and hal had a brief good natured argument about whether the term circa could modify an interval or only a specific
year  then hal asked for several examples of something called haplology  joelle kept fighting urges to slap the sleek little showoffy kid upside the head so hard his bow tie would spin   the universe     orin continued long after the wit had worn thin  
 cold  immense  incredibly universal   the subjects of tennis  baton twirling  and punting never came up  organized sports were
never once mentioned  joelle noticed that nobody seemed to look directly at dr  incandenza except her  a curious flabby white
mammarial dome covered part of the academy s grounds outside the dining room s window  mario plunged his special fork into
dr  incandenza s potato cityscape  to general applause and certain grating puns on the term deconstruction from the insufferable
hal kid  everyone s teeth were dazzling in the candlelight and uv  hal wiped mario s snout  which seemed to run continuously 
avril invited joelle by all means to make a thanksgiving call home to her family in rural kentucky if she wished  orin said the
moms was herself originally from rural quebec  joelle was on her seventh glass of wine  orin s fingering his half windsor kept
looking more and more like a signal to somebody  avril urged dr  incandenza to find a way to include joelle in a production 
since she was both a film student and a now a heartily welcome honorary addition to the family  mario  reaching for the salad  fell
out of his chair  and was helped up by one of the tennis players amid much hilarity  mario s deformities seemed wide ranging and
hard to name  joelle decided he looked like a cross between a puppet and one of the big headed carnivores from spielberg s old
special effects orgies about reptiles  hal and avril hashed out whether misspoke was a bona fide word  dr  incandenza s tall
narrow head kept inclining toward his plate and then slowly rising back up in a way that was either meditative or tipsy  deformed
mario s broad smile was so constant you could have hung things from the corners of it  in a fake southern belle accent that was
clearly no jab at joelle  more like a scarlett o hara accent  avril said she did declare that albertan champagne always gave her
 the vapors   joelle noticed that pretty much everybody at the table was smiling  broadly and constantly  eyes shiny in the plants 
odd light  she was doing it herself  too  she noticed  her cheek muscles were starting to ache  hal s larger friend kept pausing to
use his dental stimulator  nobody else was using their dental stimulator  but everyone held one politely  as if getting ready to use
it  hal and the two friends made odd spasmic one handed squeezing motions  periodically  no one seemed to notice  not once in
orin s presence did anyone mention the word tennis  he had been up half the previous night vomiting with anxiety  now he
challenged hal to name the freezing point of platinum  joelle couldn t for the life of her remember either of the names of poor old
spielberg s old computer enhanced celluloid dinosaur things  though her own daddy d personally taken her to each one  at some
point orin s father got up to go freshen his drink and never returned 
just before dessert   which was on fire   orin s moms had asked whether they could perhaps all join hands secularly for a
moment and simply be grateful for all being together  she made a special point of asking joelle to include her hands in the handholding  joelle held orin s hand and hal s smaller friend s hand  which was so callused up it felt like some sort of rind  dessert
was cherries jubilee with gourmet new brunswick ice cream  dr  incandenza s absence from the table went unmentioned  almost
unnoticed  it seemed  both hal and his nonstimulating friend pleaded for kahlua  and mario flapped pathetically at the tabletop in
imitation  avril made a show of gazing at orin in mock horror as he produced a cigar and clipper  there was also a blancmange 
the coffee was decaf with chickory  when joelle looked over again  orin had put his cigar away without lighting it 
the dinner ended in a kind of explosion of goodwill 
joelle d felt half crazed  she could detect nothing fake about the lady s grace and cheer toward her  the goodwill  and at the
same time felt sure in her guts  pit that the woman could have sat there and cut out joelle s pancreas and thymus and minced them
and prepared sweetbreads and eaten them chilled and patted her mouth without batting an eye  and unremarked by all who leaned
her way 
on the way back home  in a cab whose company s phone number hal had summoned from memory  orin hung his leg over
joelle s crossed legs and said that if anybody could have been counted on to see that the stork needed to use joelle somehow  it
was the moms  he asked joelle twice how she d liked her  joelle s cheek muscles ached something awful  when they got back to
the brownstone co op on that last pre subsidized thanksgiving was the first historical time joelle intentionally did lines of
cocaine to keep from sleeping  orin couldn t ingest anything during the season even if he wanted to  b u  s major sport teams
tested randomly  so joelle was awake at       cleaning back behind the refrigerator for the second time  when orin cried out in
the nightmare she d somehow felt should have been hers 
shaking to the confidence of his judgment of these persons  the one marathe had believed a desperate addict was revealed as
the woman in authority for the demi maison of ennet  the clip boarded woman was a mere subaltern  marathe very seldom
misjudged persons or their roles 
the woman in authority was negative on the telephone   no  no  no   she said into the telephone   no  
t am sorry   she spoke to marathe over the telephone s speaker without placing the hand of privacy over the speaker   this
won t take a second  no she can t  mars  promises don t matter  she s promised before  how many times  no  mars  because it ll
end up hurting us again and just enabling her   the other side s man s voice came loudly  and the authority stopped a sobbing with
the back of her wrist  then stiffened  marathe watched expres sionlessly  he had the great fatigue  a time at which english was
straining  there were dogs upon the floor   i know  but no  for today  no  next time she calls  ask her to call me here  yes  
she deactivated this transmission and stared at her top of the desk for a moment  two dogs lay on the floor between her chair
and marathe s fau teuil  one dog of which was licking its private organs  marathe stifled a shudder and pulled up his blanket
slightly  hunching to minimalize the musculature of health of his upper torso  also 
 good night        marathe began 
 well  don t go   the woman of authority ejaculated from coming out of her reverie of sadness  giving her seat the rotation to
face him  she tried to smile in the professional manner of u s a   after you waited all that time out there  i saw you sharing with
selwyn  selwyn tends to show up whenever we re doing group intakes  

  me  i think he suffers with mental illness   marathe noticed one leg of the woman was thinner by far of her other leg  he was
being driven distracted also by this habit to pretend to sniff  the false sniffs came from nowhere 
she crossed these legs  two autos  horns mightily blew upon the avenue far beyond the concave window of her desk 
 this selwyn  he advised me to stroke your animals  which i have regret but i will not  
this woman quietly laughed and leaned forward above the crossed legs  in addition  one of the dogs had flatulence   you
listed your citizenship as swiss  
 i am a residing alien addicted to smack  to scag  and to h  seeking desperately the residential treatment  
 but legally residing  with a green card  an o i n s        residency code  
marathe from his sportcoat produced the documents m  duplessis had arranged with foresight in the long past 
 disabled  also  also deformed   marathe said  shrugging stoically  inclining his veil at the dark carpet 
the woman was examining his o i n s  documents with the pursed mouth and face for poker of o n a n  authorities in all
places  one of her hands was twisted in the manner of a claw   we all come in with issues  henry   she said 
 henri  pardon  henn  
some woman just outside the door near the demi maison s front door  she laughed in the manner of an automatic weapon 
wet sounds were audible from beneath the rear leg of the dog with private organs  of which the head hid beneath the raised leg 
the woman of authority had to support the body by placing the hands on the desk to rise and unlock and lift the door of a black
metal cabinet over her tp and console of her desk  the door of old black metal lifted outward  marathe committed to memory the
model numbers of this teleputer  which was indonesian and of cheap cost 
 well henri  ennet house  in the years i ve been on staff here  we ve had aliens  resident aliens  e s l  s whose english was
worse than yours by a long shot   she stood on the thicker leg to reach into this cabinet deeply for some item  marathe took the
opportunity of her inattention to commit to his memory the office s facts  the office s door had a decoration of a triangle within a
circle  and no bolt of death for locking  but merely a sadly cheap recess lock in the knob  nowhere the small nozzle of standard
       ghz microwave alarming  the large windows had no small ends of wires about their frames  this left the possibility only
of a magnet contact alarm  which if so was difficult to jumper but also possible  marathe felt himself missing his wife intensely 
which always signalled his deep fatigue  twice he sniffed 
the woman was speaking into the cabinet to him         get you to sign some releases for me so we can make copies of your
o i n s  proofs and get an outtake faxed from your detox  which was in       
 the chit chat farms rehabilitation of pennsylvania state  last month   the a f r  s data liaison in montreal had promised
to arrange all records without some delay 
 in  what  wernersdale  something  
marathe cocked his veiled head ever so slightly   wernersberg of pennsylvania  
 well we know chit chat  we ve had some chit chat graduates come through the house  highest     respect   her head was
inside the cabinet  with an arm  it appeared difficult for her to rummage inside the cabinet and keep at the same time her balance 
deciding the bay windows were the optimal office s entry if required  marathe looked at the woman s attempt to balance and the
old cabinet  then he blinked slowly  in this cabinet visibly  in twin stacks near the front of the open cabinet  were many cartridges
of tp entertainment 
the woman said  and we ve been disabled accessible since the beginning  one of only a handful of houses in the metro area
that are fully equipped to take disabled clients  i assume they told you down at chit chat   the wall banged with the impact of
boisterousness in the outside room  and somebody either laughed or was in pain  marathe sniffed  the woman was continuing to
speak         why i got to come here in the first place  which i came in in a chair  too  originally  by the way   she teetered back out
from the cabinet with a folder of manila   at the time i declared up and down i was too disabled to kneel and pray  to give you an
idea of where i was at   she laughed gaily  she was attractive 
 me   marathe responded   i will attempt to pray at a moment s order   aiding the ruse of application  he and fortier
discovered  was that u s a  recovery from the addictions was somewhat paramilitary in nature  there were orders and the obeying
of orders  the a f r  had reviewed cartridges of antique u s a  programming  which they had found through luck in the
inventory of antitoi  and had watched to learn many things  but casting his veiled face desperately upward while saying allowed
that marathe could scan along the plastic cases of cartridges  spines  among the small of font titles such as focal length
parameters x xl and drop volley ex  ii were two cases of plain brown plastic  blank  except for   this was why his veil  it
remained tilted upward for so much longer that he was concerned that this woman of authority   except for   but it was difficult
of sureness  for the office s light was the deadening fluorescence of u s a   and the cabinet s mouth in the shadow of the lid and
the cheesecloth veil made less his focus   except maybe for tiny round faces of embossed smiles upon the brown cases  marathe
felt suddenly the excitement of himself   m  hugh steeply s wording for this had been from somewhere blue 
the authority spoke also   not to mention u h i d  members  you might want to know   gesturing then at the veil of marathe
neither was mentioning  the woman attempted to affix a sheet of faint toner to a board with a clip   in fact we have a u h i d 
member in early residency right now  
marathe blinked twice more  he said  i am deformed  me  
 she might be able to help you adjust  identify  be good for her  too  
marathe had begun locking down in ram every detail of every moment since his entering the ennet house demi maison  he
in another part of his brain considered whether he would report truly first to m  fortier or to the steeply of u s b s s   whose
contact number had always the prefix of       he had jested  in another part was whether to seem eager for meeting the
entertainment s performer here now  a fellow veil  to think of what a desperate addict would have eagerness in  marathe was
throughout this thinking smiling largely at the woman  forgetting she could not witness it   this is happy   finally he said 
 your facial issues    the person stated  leaning in over the crossed legs in her chair   are they connected to your use and
abuse  did they work with you on progression and y e t s       and owning consequences at chit chat  
marathe was in little hurry now to leave for returning to chez antitoi  he utilized his abilities to recite complex lines of
covering story on addiction while also at the time reviewed locking down the face and locations of every person at the ennet

 house he had regarded  for they would come here again  the a f r   and maybe services without specificity of steeply and tine 
as well  he had the ability of splitting his mind s thinking along several parallel tracks 
 the legs   i do an overdose in berne  which is in my home of switzerland  while alone  and i fall down face down while
my legs  they remain how you say tangle  tangled in the chair on which occurred this injection  fix  a stupid  i lie down without
conscious or to move for many days  and my legs  they   comment on diti   they are sleepy  lose the circulating  suffer
gangrene  become infectious   marathe sniffed while stoically shrugging   as well the nose and mouth  from facial squishing of
lying face down in a position without conscious for days  i die almost  all is amputated  for my life  i withdraw from the scag 
smack  and h  in i infirmiere  a result of abuse of the drugs  
 this is your story  this is your first step  
marathe shrugged   my legs  my nose and oral  all as a consequence of the progression  at the chit chat  i admit all the
things  i realize i am addicted desperately   marathe was trying to decide if to find ways to make the authority woman briefly leave
the office  so that marathe might rapidly arm climb up to the cabinet to regard the smiling cases of cartridge closely before the
cabinet s locking  or instead also to return on pretext to remain and hang roundly in the living room for waiting persons  to find a
glimpse of who is this mentioned resident with her female u h i d  veil  for this is the purpose of coming to demi maisons m 
fortier gave  marathe could give the fact of the cartridges to fortier and the veiled girl to steeply  or oppositely  the fatigue
returned  but steeply  before committing to overt action  will wish for confirmation that those in the cabinet were items of the true
entertainment  not the blank and joking f l q  displays  there was truly a faint whirring noise coming from the head  he
imagined  marathe s sidearm sat in its holster under the seat of him  hidden by the plaid colored blanket of his lap  to easily kill
the person in authority was inutile at this time of not glimpsing the girl  he had decided  plus impractical of surrounding witness 
marathe s fauteuil could travel    kph on a level surface over short distance  the authority figure liked to comb at the bright hair
with her claw of the deformed hand  she was telling marathe the false addict that she found his honesty encouraging and saying to
sign these forms  for releasing  as marathe signed slowly the name of a deceased health benefits administrator at the caisse de
depot et placement        the woman began to ask about what lengths he believed he was willing to go to 
the whole family was lousy with secrets  she d decided  was part of the nonturkey dinner s sadness  from each other 
themselves  itself  a big one being this pretense that overt eccentricity was the same as openness  i e  that they were all  exactly as
crazy as they seem    the punter s phrase 
we re all a lot more intuitive about our lovers  families than we are about our own families  she knew  charlotte treat s face
glistened  her cheek s deep scars were a more violent red than the rest  her ribs under the wet michelob dry t shirt were starting
to stand out  her neck to get that skinny stemmy look of katexia  she looked like a ravaged fowl  kate gompert s bed sat unmade 
a copy of some yellow paperback called feeling good open facedown on the mattress and starting to curl  joelle had this weird
fear that gompert  who made joelle extremely nervous at the best of times  would come home and walk in and find joelle
cleaning with her hair in a kerchief and veil damply clinging  she used the last of the room s kleenex dusting all five bedside
tables  wiping in careful rings around objects she wasn t to touch 
there was then some trickiness in the situation when the demi maison s woman offered the extension of a place for marathe 
desperately addicted henri the swiss could sleep upon the convertisofa in the rear office this very p m   she said  if he was
willing to endure the mess and sometimes insects of the rear office  the woman had a ripe spot of sympathique for the disableds 
marathe could see  for trickiness in the situation  no lines had been prepared by fortier to defer this offer of the extension of the
spot of treatment in the demi maison  the woman in authority smiled that she could see in his playing with the fauteuil s wheels
the addicted struggle between desperation and denial  she said  marathe was rapidly calculating should he falsely accept and
remain here for one night to observe for himself the description of the veiled patient from u h i d   against should he exit and roll
like no person s business to the nearest place of private telephoning to alert the a f r  at the shop that here at this demi maison
were of possibility real cartridges of the entertainment  perhaps including a duplicatable master or the anti samizdat remedy
cartridge of f l q  s allegation  to return to chez antitoi and return later in squeaking force to the demi maison and acquire both
the cartridges and the veiled performer  if the u h i d  patient of treatment is revealed as the disguised performer  the engineer of
radio had spoken volubly of this person s veil and screen  or calculating also whether to telephone not antitoi entertainent but the
   hour costless prefix of m  mlle  steeply and convey the very same information instead  finally  first  to bureau des services
sans specificite  placing bets on o n a n  and against fortier  casting his lots finally with one side only  conveying his restenotic
wife and entertainment hungry children down from st  remi d amherst s convexity ravaged wastes to live with him the rest of
their lives down here among u s a  s confusion of choices  demanding hidden protection from steeply and high income medical
care for the heart  and head difficulties of beloved gertraude 
or to tell this figure of medical authority to look out behind for a large spider and thereupon snap her slim neck with one hand
and use the telephone console in this office to summon fortier and an a f r  elite detail directly to this demi maison  or else to
summon directly steeply and the white suiting forces of o n a n   the authority made a spire of her fingers beneath her chin and
gazed at marathe s cocked head with a face of respect and sympathy but not solicitude  also which made snapping her neck with
one hand seem a sad choice for marathe  he pretended that it was necessary to sniff  mssrs  fortier and broullime  the a f r 
others he had known well since the days of when they stood together tensed at the crossings of many trains  beneath the sky s
moon   none of them sensed truly that marathe has lost the belly for this type of work  that marathe  he must fight the nausea of
the stomach as he pushed the sharpened handle of the manche a balai broomstick through the antitoi s insides during the technical
interview of the antitoi  and later had vomited out into the alley under secrecy  one of the office s dogs chewed at its haunch with
great ferocity  in misery  in the u s a  of o n a n   m  mlle  hugh helen steeply of the clandestine u s o u s  u s b s s 
would hide the family of marathe in obscure suburban locales  with papers of identity fashioned by specialists in above reproach
and no suspicion  and marathe  his familiarity with the knowledge of quebecois insurgency would be comfortably rewarded once
notre rai pays seceded to alone draw down the wrath of chanteur fou gentle s anger  the a f r  s triumph of dissemination of
the lethal entertainment would ensure marathe s valuable welcome by gentle and his wife s beloved treatments for the ventricle
and lack of skull  marathe pictured gertraude with a helmet and hook of gold  breathing easily through expensive tubes  the
variable of calculus was how long to remain and work for dissemination against when to jump to the safety of american welcome 

 fortier s wrath would be implacable at marathe s  perdant son coeur         and it may be far wiser of waiting until quebec had
been evicted and the a f r  were fully engaged to reveal his quadrupling for o n a n   marathe 
knocking at the office s door at the same time as entering came a young girl with missing teeth  radiating coldness from the
exterior outside the demi maison  leaning only her upper half of the body into the office through the doorway she had opened 
 clocking in  boss   the young girl stated in the flat nasality of boston u s a 
the woman in authority smiled in return   two more to interview  john ette  then i m off  
 pisser  
 can you let the people in from the shed when they come for mrs  lopate  
the young and inclined girl nodded her slim head  in a nostril a generic diaper pin was transperce  which glittered in the
fluorescence of the light as she nodded   and janice says she s screwing out of here now and any message for her before she goes  
the authority negated with her head at this  the young girl in the door looked down upon marathe and said  hey  or  eh  in a
greeting of neutral emotions  marathe smiled with desperation and pretended to sniff  visible smoke s odor came through the open
door from the noisy salon beyond it  marathe decided firmly against the snapping of any necks upon this visit  because of bodies
leaning with suddenness into the office unexpectedly  the torso of the person began to withdraw as suddenly the authority looked
up and stated  oh and johnette  
the door swung more open once more as the returned upper half replied  yo  
 do me a favor  clenette h  brought some donie cartridges down from e t a  this afternoon  
 let me guess  
 the natives are restless   the authority laughed aloud   something new  
the torso laughed as well   did you see mcdade s watching that korean thing again out here  
 so can you just run them through after lights out  as many as you can  check and make sure they re appropriate  
 no skin  no substances  light drinking only   the young girl said in the manner of reviewing the rehearsal of something
learned 
 as many as you can get through  and leave them on janice s desk  and i ll have her put them out at the start of the day shift
tomorrow  
the young girl of substitute authority made a curious circle with two of her fingers in the air of the doorway  some kind of
signal of the hand to the chief authority  every finger of the hand of the girl wore a ring of different type   the natives ll be
grateful  for once  
 they re in the cabinet with the intakes   the authority told her 
 i ll watch them during dream duty  as many as there s time  
 and johnette  
once more the torso reextended inward 
the woman with authority said  and keep emil and wade from tormenting david k   will you please  
marathe smiled largely as the door closed entirely and the authority made a small motion of apologies for being interrupted   i
do not have these meanings donie and natives  if i may boldly ask   he said   nor etier  
a laugh of friendliness  it occurred to marathe that this was a happy person   donies are donated goods  which we depend on
more than we d like  the residents and alums are always on the lookout  sometimes we call the current residents the natives  we
mean it as affectionate  that was johnette  she s living       staff  we ve got two living staff  alums of the house  one s under
the weather  but johnette s   you ll like johnette  johnette s a keeper  e t a  is letters  e t a  
marathe pretended to laugh aloud   i beg a pardon  for i thought some etier in the pronunciation of my native swiss  
the authority smiled with understanding   e t a  s a private school  we usually get some residents on up there  part time  it s
just up the hill   seeing the deep intake of veil which his inhaling caused for one moment only  the authority expressed surprise of
the face and said  but you did know ennet s a working house  residents have a month to find work  normally   exhaling with care 
marathe gestured faintly as in but of course 

   november year of the depend adult undergarment
part of mario s footage for the documentary they re letting him do on this fall s e t a  consists of mario just walking around
different parts of the academy with the bolex h   camera strapped to his head and joined by coax cable to the foot treadle  which
he holds against his sweatered chest with one hand and operates with the other  at      at night it s cold out  the center courts
are brightly lit  but only one court is being used  gretchen holt and jolene criess still winding up some sort of marathon challenge
from the p m  session  the hands around their grips bluish and sweaty hair frozen into electrified spikes  pausing between points to
blow noses on sleeves  wearing so many layers of sweats they look barrel bodied out there  and mario doesn t bother with the
change in film speed he d need to record them through the steamed window of schtitt s room  where he is  the room s noise is
deafening 
coach schtitt s room is      next to his office on the first floor of comm  ad   past dr  rusk s office and down a two corner
hall from the lobby 
it s a big empty room  built for its stereo  hardwood floor in need of sanding  a wooden chair and a cane chair  an army cot  a
little low table just big enough for schtitt s pipe rack  a folding card table folded up and leaning against the wall  acoustic
damping tile on all the walls and nothing decorative hanging or mounted on the walls  acoustic tiling on the ceiling also  with a
bare overhead light with a long chain mounted in a dirty ceiling fan with a short chain  the fan never rotates but sometimes emits
a sound of faulty wiring  there s a faint odor of magic marker in the room  there is nothing upholstered  no pillow on the cot 
nothing soft to absorb or deflect the sound of the equipment stacked on the floor  the black germanness of a top shelf sound
system  a mario sized speaker in each corner of the room with the cloth cover removed so each woofer s cone is exposed and
mightily throbbing  schtitt s room is soundproofed  the window faces the center courts  the transom and observatory directly
overhead and mangling the shadows of the courts  lights  the window is right over the radiator  which when the stereo is off

 makes odd hollow ringing clanky clunks as if someone deep underground were having at the pipes with a hammer  the cold
window over the radiator is steamed and trembles slightly with wagnerian bass 
gerhardt schtitt is asleep in the cane chair in the middle of the empty room  his head thrown back and arms hanging  hands
treed with arteries you can see his slow pulse in  his feet are stolidly on the floor  his knees spread way out wide  the way schtitt
always has to sit  on account of his varicoceles  his mouth is partly open and a dead pipe hangs at an alarming angle from its
corner  mario records him sleeping for a little while  looking very old and white and frail  yet also obscenely fit  what s on and
making the window shiver and condensed droplets gather and run in little bullet headed lines down the glass is a duet that keeps
climbing in pitch and emotion  a german second tenor and a german soprano are either very happy or very unhappy or both 
mario s ears are extremely sensitive  schtitt sleeps only amid excruciatingly loud european opera  he s shared with mario several
different tales of grim childhood experiences at a bmw sponsored  quality control orientated  austrian akademie to account for
his rem peculiarities  the soprano leaves the baritone and goes up to a high d and just hangs there  either shattered or ecstatic 
schtitt doesn t stir  not even when mario falls twice  loudly  trying to get to the door with his hands over his ears 
the community administration stairwells are narrow and no nonsense  red railings of cold iron whose red is one coat of
primer  steps and walls of raw colored rough cement  the sort of sandy echo in there that makes you take stairs as fast as
possible  the salve makes a sucking sound  the upper halls are empty  low voices and lights from under the doors on the second
floor       is still mandatory study period  there won t be serious movement till       when the girls will drift from room to
room  congregating  doing whatever packs of girls in robes and furry slippers do late at night  until delint kills all the dormitory
lights at the dorms  main breaker around       isolated movement  a door down the hall opens and shuts  the vaught twins are
heading down the hall to the bathroom at the far end  wearing only an enormous towel  one of their heads in curlers  one of the
falls in mr  schtitt s room had been on the burnt hip  and squunched salve from the bandage is starting to darken the corduroys at
that side of the pelvis  though there is zero pain  three tense voices behind carol spodek and shoshana abram s door  lists of
degrees and focal lengths  a study group for mr  ogilvie s  reflections on refraction  exam tomorrow  a girl s voice from he can t
tell which room says  steep hot beach sea  twice very distinctly and then is still  mario is leaning back against a wall in the
hallway  panning idly  felicity zweig emerges from her door by the stairwell carrying a soap dish and wearing a towel tied at that
breast level  as if there were breasts  moving toward mario on her way to the head  she puts her hand out straight at his head s
camera  a kind of distant stiff arm as she passes 
 i m wearing a towel  
 i understand   mario says  using his arms to turn himself around and pointing the lens at the bare wall 
 i m wearing a towel  
brisk controlled sounds of retching from behind diane prins s door  mario gets a couple seconds of zweig hurrying away in
the towel  tiny little bird steps  looking terribly fragile 
the stairwells smell like the cement they re made of 
behind      ingersoll and penn s door  is the faint rubbery squeak of somebody moving around on crutches  someone in    
is yelling  boner check  boner check   a lot of the third floor is for boys under fourteen  the hall carpet up here is ectoplasmically
stained  the expanses of wall between doors hung with posters of professional players endorsing gear  someone has drawn a
goatee and fangs on an old donnay poster of mats wilander  and the poster of gilbert treffert is defaced with anti canadian slurs 
otis lord s door has infirmary next to his name on the door s name card  penn s room s door s card s name also had infirmary 
sounds of someone talking low to someone who s sobbing from beak  whale  and virgilio s room  and mario resists an impulse to
knock  lamont chu s door next door is completely covered with magazines  action shots of matches  mario is leaning back to get
footage of the door when lamont chu exits the bathroom at this end in a terry robe and thongs and wet hair  literally whistling
 dixie  
 mario  
mario gets him bearing down  his calves hairless and muscular  hair water dripping onto his robe s shoulders with each step 
 lamont chu  
 what s happening  
 nothing s happening  
chu stands there just within conversation range  he s only slightly taller than mario  a door down the hall opens and a head
sticks out and scans and then withdraws 
 well   chu squares his shoulders and looks into the camera atop mario s head   you want me to say something for posterity  
 sure  
 what should i say  
 you can say anything you want  
chu draws himself way up and looks penetrating  mario checks the meter on his belt and uses the treadle to shorten the focal
length and adjust the angle of the camera s lens slightly downward  right at chu  and there are tiny grinding adjustment sounds
from the bolex 
chu s still just standing there   i can t think what to say  
 that happens to me all the time  
 the minute your invitation became official my mind went blank  
 that can happen  
 there s just this staticky blank field in there now  
 i know just what you mean  
they stand there silent  the camera s mechanism emitting a tiny whir 
mario says  you just got out of the shower  i can tell  
 i was talking with good old lyle downstairs  
 lyle s terrific  
 i was going to just whip right over into the showers  but the locker room s got this  like  odor  

  it s always great to talk with good old lyle  
 so i came up here  
 everything you re saying is very good  
lamont chu stands there a moment looking at mario  who s smiling and chu can tell wants to nod furiously  but can t 
because he needs to keep the bolex steady   what i was doing  i was filling lyle in on the eschaton debacle  telling him about the
lack of hard info  the conflicted rumors that are going around  about how kittenplan and some of the big buds are going to get
blamed  about disciplinary action for the buds  
 lyle s just an outstanding person to go to with concerns   mario says  fighting not to nod furiously 
 lord s head and penn s leg  the postman s broken nose  what s going to happen to the incster  
 you re acting perfectly natural  this is very good  
 i m asking if you ve heard from hal what they re going to do  if he s in on the blame from tavis  pemulis and kittenplan i can
see  but i m having trouble with the idea of struck or your brother taking discipline for what happened out there  they were
strictly from spectation for the whole thing  kittenplan s bud is spodek  and she wasn t even out there  
 i m getting all this  you ll be glad to know  
chu is now looking at mario  which for mario is weird because he s looking through the viewfinder  a lens eye view  which
means when chu looks down from the lens to look at mario it looks to mario like he s looking down south somewhere along
mario s thorax 
 mario  i m asking if hal s told you what they re going to do to anybody  
 is this what you re saying  or are you asking me  
 asking  
chu s face looks slightly oval and convex through the lens s fish eye  a jutting aspect   so what if i want to use this that you re
saying for the documentary i ve been asked to make  
 jesus  mario  use whatever you want  i m just saying i have conscience trouble with the idea of hal and troeltsch  and
struck didn t even seem like he was conscious for the debacle itself  
 i should tell you i feel like we re getting the totally real lamont chu here  
 mario  camera to one side  i m standing here dripping asking you for hal s impressions of when tavis called them in  as in
did he give you impressions  van vleck at lunch said he yesterday saw pemulis and hal coming out of tavis s office with the
association urine guy holding them both by the ear  van vleck said hal s face was the color of kaopectate  
mario directs the lens at chu s shower thongs so he can look over the viewfmder at chu   are you saying this  or is this what
happened  
 that s what i m asking you  mario  if hal told you what happened  
 i follow what you re saying  
 so you asked whether i was asking  and i m asking you about it  
mario zooms in very tight  chu s complexion is a kind of creamy green  with not one follicle in view   lamont  i m going to
find you and tell you whatever hal tells me  this is so good  
 so then you haven t talked to hal  
 when  
 jesus  mario  it s like trying to talk to a rock with you sometimes  
 this is going very well

checking its load  her desk has what looks like a skyline of stacks of file folders and books in neat cross hatched stacks  nothing
teeters  the open book on top facing mario is dowty  wall and peters s seminal introduction to montague semantics       
which has very fascinating illustrations that mario doesn t look at this time  trying to film the cock of the moms s head and the
phone s extended antenna against the cumulus of her hair from behind  capturing her back unawares 
but the sound of mario entering even a shag carpeted room is unmistakable  plus she can see his reflection in the window 
 mario   her arms go up in a v  stapler open in one hand  facing the window 
 the moms   it s a good ten meters past the seminar table and viewer and portable blackboard to the far part of the office
where the desk is  and each step on the deep shag is precarious  mario resembling a very old brittle boned man or someone
carrying a load of breakables down a slick hill 

  hel o   she s addressing his reflection in the quartered window  watching him put the treadle down carefully on the desk and
struggle with the pack on his back   not you   she tells the phone  she points the stapler at the image of the bolex on the image of
his head   are we on air  
mario laughs   would you like to be  
she tells the phone she s still here  that mario s come in 
 i don t want to intercept your call  
 don t be absurd   she talks past the phone at the window  she rotates her swivel chair to face mario  the receiver s antenna
describing a half moon and now pointing up at the window behind her  there are two blue chairs like the reception area chairs in
front of her desk  she doesn t indicate to mario to sit  mario s most comfortable standing and leaning into the support of the police
lock he s trying to detach from his canvas plastron and lower  shucking the pack off his back at the same time  avril looks at him
like the sort of stellar mother where just looking at her kid gives her joy  she doesn t offer to help him get the lock s lead brace out
of the pack because she knows he d feel completely comfortable asking for her help if he needed it  it s like she feels these two
sons are the people in her life with whom so little important needs to be said that she loves it  the bolex and support yoke and
viewfinder over his forehead and eyes give mario an underwater look  his movements  setting and bracing his police lock  are at
once graceless and deft  the lit center courts  now empty  are visible out the left side of avril s window  if you lean far forward
and look  someone has forgotten a gear bag and pile of sticks out by the net post of court    
silences between them are totally comfortable  mario can t tell if the person on the phone is still talking or if avril just hasn t
put the dead phone down  she still holds the black stapler  its jaws are open and it looks alli gatorish in her hand 
 is this you passing through the neighborhood poking a head in to say hello  or am i a subject  tonight  
 you can be a subject  moms   he moves the big head around in a weary circle   i get tired from wearing this  
 it gets heavy  i ve held it  
 it s good  
 i remember his making that  he took such care making that  it s the last time i believe he enjoyed himself on something 
thoroughly  
 it s terrific  
 he took weeks putting everything together  
he likes to look at her  too  leaning in and letting her know he likes looking  they are the two least embarrassable people
either of them knows  she s rarely here this late  she has a big study at the hmh  the only thing that ever shows she s tired is that
her hair gets a sort of huge white cowlick  like a rolling ocean comber of hair  and just on one side  the side with the phone 
sticking up and touching the antenna  her hair has been pure white since mario can first remember seeing her looking down at
him through the incubator s glass  pictures of her own father s hair were like that  it goes down the middle of her back against the
chair and down both arms  hanging off the arms near the elbow  its part shows her pink scalp  she keeps the hair very clean and
well combed  she has one of mr  delint s big whistles around her neck  the big cowlick casts a bent shadow on the sill of the
window  there s a maple leaf flag and a    star u s a  flag hanging limp off brass poles on either side of the window  in an
extreme corner are fleur de lis pennons on tall sharp polished sticks  c t  s office has an o n a n  flag and a    star u s a 
flag       
 i had quality interface dialogue with lamont chu upstairs  but i made the girl felicity  the really thin one   she got upset 
she said only a towel  
 felicity will be just fine  so you re just strolling  peripatetic footage   she refuses to adjust syntax  to speak in any way down
to him  it d be beneath him  though he seems not to mind when most people do it  speak down 
nor will she ask about the burn on his pelvis unless he brings it up  she s careful to keep her oar out of mario s health stuff
unless he brings things up  out of concern that it might be taken as intrusive or smothering 
 i saw your lights  why is the moms here  still  i thought to myself  
she made as if to clutch her head   don t ask  i ll starting whingeing  tomorrow s going to be hellishly busy   mario didn t hear
her say goodbye to the man as she put down the phone so the antenna now points at mario s chest  she s putting out the nub of the
benson   hedge against the rooster comb holder he d squeezed and karate chopped and put down the bowl s center  when he
made it  after she d said she wanted it to be an ashtray   you give me such pleasure standing there  all outfitted for work   she said 
 aprowl   she ground individual sparks out in the bowl  she had the idea that her smoking around mario made him worry  though
he d never said anything about it one way or the other   i have a breakfast engagement at     which means i have to do final
swotting and whacking for morning classes now  so i just lurched back over here to do it instead of carrying everything back and
forth  
 are you tired  
she just smiled at him 
 this is off   pointing at his head   i turned it off  
to look at them  you d never guess these two persons were related  one sitting and one standing canted forward 
 will you eat with us  i hadn t even thought of dinner until i saw you  i don t even know what there might be for dinner  many
wonders        turkey cartilage  your bag is by the radio  will you stay again  charles is still in conference  i believe  he said  
 about the debracle with the eschaton and the postman s nose  
 a person from a magazine has come to do a piece of reportage on your brother  charles is speaking to her in lieu of any of
the students  you may speak to her about orin if you like  
 she s been aprowl for hal  ortho said  
avril has a certain way of cocking her fine head at him 
 your poor uncle charles has been with thierry and this magazine person since this afternoon  
 have you talked to him  
 i ve been trying to buttonhole your brother  he s not in your room  the pemulis person was seen by mary esther taking their
truck before study period  is hal with him  mario  

  i haven t seen hal since lunchtime  he said he d had a tooth thing  
 i didn t even find out he d been to see zeggarelli until today  
 he asked about how the burn on my pelvis is  
 which i won t ask about unless you d care to discuss how it s coming along  
 it s fine  plus hal said he wishes i d come back and sleep there  
 i left two messages asking him to let me know how the tooth was  love o  i feel bad i wasn t there for him  hal and his
teeth  
 did c t  tell what happened  was he upset  was that c t  on the phone you were with   mario can t see why the moms
would call c t  on the phone when he was in there right across the hall behind his doors  when she didn t smoke a lot of the time
she held a pen in her mouth  mario didn t know why  her college mug has about a hundred blue pens in it  on the desk  she likes
to square herself in her chair  sitting up extra straight and grasping the chair s arms in a commanding posture  she looks like
something mario can t place when she does this  he keeps thinking the word typhoon  he knows she s not trying to consciously be
commanding with him 
 how was your own day  i want to hear  
 hey moms  
 i determined years ago that my position needs to be that i trust my children  and i d never traffic in third party hearsay when
the lines of communication with my children are as open and judgment free as i m fortunate they are  
 that seems like a really good position  hey moms  
 so i have no problem waiting to hear about eschaton  teeth  and urine from your brother  who ll come to me the moment it s
appropriate for him to come to me  
 hey moms  
 i m right here  love o  
tycoon is the term her commanding way of sitting suggests  grasping her chair  a pen clamped in her teeth like a
businessman s cigar  there were other carpet prints in the heavy shag 
 moms  
 yes  
 can i ask you a thing  
 please do  
 this is off   again indicating the silent apparatus on his head 
 is this a confidential thing  then  
 there isn t any secret  my day was i was wondering about something  in my mind  
 i m right here for you anytime day or night  mario  as you are for me  as i am for hal and we all are for each other   she
gestures in a hard to describe way   right here  
 moms  
 i am right here with my attention completely focused on you  
 how can you tell if somebody s sad  
a quick smile   you mean whether someone s sad  
a smile back  but still earnest   that improves it a lot  whether someone s sad  how can you tell so you re sure  
her teeth are not discolored  she gets them cleaned at the dentist all the time for the smoking  a habit she despises  hal
inherited the dental problems from himself  himself had horrible dental problems  half his teeth were bridges 
 you re not exactly insensitive when it comes to people  love o   she says 
 what if you  like  only suspect somebody s sad  how do you reinforce the suspicion  
 confirm the suspicion  
 in your mind   some of the prints in the deep shag he can see are shoes  and some are different  almost like knuckles  his
lordotic posture makes him acute and observant about things like carpet prints 
 how would i  for my part  confirm a suspicion of sadness in someone  you mean  
 yes  good  all right  
 well  the person in question may cry  sob  weep  or  in certain cultures  wail  keen  or rend his or her garments  
mario nods encouragingly  so the headgear clanks a little   but say in a case where they don t weep or rend  but you still have
a suspicion which they re sad  
she uses a hand to rotate the pen in her mouth like a fine cigar   he or she might alternatively sigh  mope  frown  smile
halfheartedly  appear downcast  slump  look at the floor more than is appropriate  
 but what if they don t  
 well  he or she may act out by seeming distracted  losing enthusiasm for previous interests  the person may present with
what appears to be laziness  lethargy  fatigue  sluggishness  a certain passive reluctance to engage you  torpor  
 what else  
 they may seem unusually subdued  quiet  literally  low  
mario leans all his weight into his police lock  which makes his head jut  his expression the sort of mangled one that
expresses puzzlement  an attempt to reason out something hard  pemulis called it mario s data search face  which mario liked 
 what if sometime they might act even less low than normal  but still these suspicions are in your mind  
she s about the same height sitting as mario upright and leaning forward  now neither of them is quite looking at the other 
both just a couple degrees off  avril taps the pen against her front teeth  her phone light is blinking  but there s no ringing  the
thing s handset s antenna still points at mario  her hands are not her age  she hoists the executive chair back slightly to cross her
legs 
 would you feel comfortable telling me whether we re discussing a particular person  
 hey moms  

  is there someone specific in whom you re intuiting sadness  
 moms  
 is this about hal  is hal sad and for some reason not yet able to speak about it  
 i  m just saying how to be generally sure  
 and you have no idea where he is or whether he left the grounds this evening sad  
lunch today was the exact same as lunch yesterday  pasta with tuna and garlic  and thick wheaty bread  and required salad 
and milk or juice  and pears in juice in a dish  mrs  clark had taken a sick morning off because when she came in this morning
pemulis at lunch said one of the breakfast girls had said there d been brooms on the wall in an x of brooms  out of nowhere  on the
wall  when she d come in very early to fire up the wheatina cauldron  and nobody knowing how the brooms were there or why or
who glued them on had upset mrs  clarke s nerves  who d been with the incandenzas since long before e t a   and had nerves 
 i didn t see hal since lunchtime  he had an apple he cut into chunks and put peanut butter on  instead of pears in juice  
avril nods with vigor 
 lamont didn t know either  mr  schtitt is asleep in his chair in his room  hey moms  
avril incandenza can switch a bic from one side of her mouth to the other without using her hand  she never knows she s
doing it when she s doing it   whether or not we re discussing anyone in particular  then  
mario smiles at her 
 hypothetically  then  you may be picking up in someone a certain very strange type of sadness that appears as a kind of
disassociation from itself  maybe  love o  
 i don t know disassociation  
 well  love  but you know the idiom  not yourself     he s not himself today   for example   crooking and uncrooking
fingers to form quotes on either side of what she says  which mario adores   there are  apparently  persons who are deeply afraid
of their own emotions  particularly the painful ones  grief  regret  sadness  sadness especially  perhaps  dolores describes these
persons as afraid of obliteration  emotional engulfment  as if something truly and thoroughly felt would have no end or bottom 
would become infinite and engulf them  
 engulf means obliterate  
 i am saying that such persons usually have a very fragile sense of themselves as persons  as existing at all  this
interpretation is  existential   mario  which means vague and slightly flaky  but i think it may hold true in certain cases  my own
father told stories of his own father  whose potato farm had been in st  pamphile and very much larger than my father s  my
grandfather had had a marvelous harvest one season  and he wanted to invest money  this was in the early     s  when there was
a great deal of money to be made on upstart companies and new american products  he apparently narrowed the field to two
choices   delaware brand punch  or an obscure sweet fizzy coffee substitute that sold out of pharmacy soda fountains and was
rumored to contain smidgeons of cocaine  which was the subject of much controversy in those days  my father s father chose
delaware punch  which apparently tasted like rancid cranberry juice  and the manufacturer of which folded  and then his next two
potato harvests were decimated by blight  resulting in the forced sale of his farm  coca cola is now coca cola  my father said his
father showed very little emotion or anger or sadness about this  though  that he somehow couldn t  my father said his father was
frozen  and could feel emotion only when he was drunk  he would apparently get drunk four times a year  weep about his life 
throw my father through the living room window  and disappear for several days  roaming the countryside of l islet province 
drunk and enraged  
she s not been looking at mario this whole time  though mario s been looking at her 
she smiled   my father  of course  could himself tell this story only when be was drunk  he never threw anyone through any
windows  he simply sat in his chair  drinking ale and reading the newspaper  for hours  until he fell out of the chair  and then one
day he fell out of the chair and didn t get up again  and that was how your maternal grandfather passed away  i d never have gotten
to go to university had he not died when i was a girl  he believed education was a waste for girls  it was a function of his era  it
wasn t his fault  his inheritance to charles and me paid for university  
she s been smiling pleasantly this whole time  emptying the butt from the ashtray into the wastebasket  wiping the bowl s
inside with a kleenex  straightening straight piles of folders on her desk  a couple odd long crinkly paper strips of bright red hung
over the side of the wastebasket  which was normally totally empty and clean 
avril incandenza is the sort of tall beautiful woman who wasn t ever quite world class  shiny magazine class beautiful  but
who early on hit a certain pretty high point on the beauty scale and has stayed right at that point as she ages and lots of other
beautiful women age too and get less beautiful  she s    years old  and mario gets pleasure out of just getting to look at her face 
still  she doesn t think she s pretty  he knows  orin and hal both have parts of her prettiness in different ways  mario likes to look
at hal and at their mother and try to see just what slendering and spacing of different features makes a woman s face different
from a man s  in attractive people  a male face versus a face you can just tell is female  avril thinks she s much too tall to be
pretty  she d seemed much less tall when compared to himself  who was seriously tall  mario wears small special shoes  almost
perfectly square  with weights at the heel and velcro straps instead of laces  and a pair of the corduroys orin incandenza had worn
in elementary school  which mario still favors and wears instead of brand new pants he s given  and a warm crewneck sweater
that s striped like a flea 
 my point here is that certain types of persons are terrified even to poke a big toe into genuinely felt regret or sadness  or to
get angry  this means they are afraid to live  they are imprisoned in something  i think  frozen inside  emotionally  why is this 
no one knows  love o  it s sometimes called  suppression     with the fingers out to the sides again   dolores believes it derives
from childhood trauma  but i suspect not always  there may be some persons who are born imprisoned  the irony  of course 
being that the very imprisonment that prohibits sadness s expression must itself feel intensely sad and painful  for the hypothetical
person in question  there may be sad people right here at the academy who are like this  mario  and perhaps you re sensitive to it 
you are not exactly insensitive when it comes to people  
mario scratches his lip again 
she says  what i ll do    leaning forward to write something on a post it note with a different pen than the one she has in her

 mouth    is to write down for you the terms disassociation  engulfment  and suppression  which i ll put next to another word 
repression  with an underlined unequal sign between them  because they denote entirely different things and should not be
regarded as synonyms  
mario shifts slightly forward   sometimes i get afraid when you forget you have to talk more simply to me  
 well then i m both sorry for that and grateful that you can tell me about it  i do forget things  particularly when i m tired  i
forget and just get going   lining the edges up and folding the little sticky note in half and then half again and dropping it into the
waste basket without having to look for where the wastebasket is  her chair is a fine executive leather swivelling chair but it
shrieks a little when she leans back or forward  mario can tell she s making herself not look at her watch  which is all right 
 hey moms  
 people  then  who are sad  but who can t let themselves feel sad  or express it  the sadness  i m trying rather clunkily to say 
these persons may strike someone who s sensitive as somehow just not quite right  not quite there  blank  distant  muted  distant 
spacey was an american term we grew up with  wooden  deadened  disconnected  distant  or they may drink alcohol or take
other drugs  the drugs both blunt the real sadness and allow some skewed version of the sadness some sort of expression  like
throwing someone through a living room window out into the flowerbeds she d so very carefully repaired after the last incident  
 moms  i think i get it  
 is that better  then  instead of my maundering on and on  
she s risen to pour herself coffee from the last black bit in the glass pot  so her back is almost to him as she stands there at the
little sideboard  an old folded pair of u s a  football pants and a helmet are on top of one of the file cabinets by the flag  her one
memento of orin  who won t talk to them or contact them in any way  she has an old mug with a cartoon of someone in a dress
small and perspectivally distant in a knee high field of wheat or rye  that says to a woman outstanding in her field 
a blue blazer with an o n a n t a  insignia is hung very neatly and straight on a wooden hanger from the metal tree of the
coatrack in the corner  she s always had her coffee out of the outstanding field mug  even in weston  the moms hangs up
stuff like shirts and blazers neater and more wrinkle free than anyone alive  the mug has a hair thin brown crack down one side 
but it s not dirty or stained  and she never gets lipstick on the rim the way other ladies over fifty years old pinken cups  rims 
mario was involuntarily incontinent up to his early teens  his father and later hal had changed him for years  never once
judging or wrinkling their face or acting upset or sad 
 but except hey moms  
 i m still right here  
avril couldn t change diapers  she d come to him in tears  he d been seven  and explained  and apologized  she just couldn t
handle diapers  she just couldn t deal with them  she d sobbed and asked him to forgive her and to assure her that he understood it
didn t mean she didn t love him to death or find him repellent 
 can you be sensitive to something sad even though the person isn t not himself  
she especially likes to hold the coffee s mug in both hands   pardon me  
 you explained it very well  it helped a lot  except what if it s that they re almost like even more themselves than normal 
than they were before  if it s not that he s blank or dead  if he s himself even more than before a sad thing happened  what if that
happens and you still think he s sad  inside  somewhere  
one thing that s happened as she got over fifty is she gets a little red sideways line in the skin between her eyes when she
doesn t follow you  ms  poutrincourt gets the same little line  and she s twenty eight  t don t follow you  how can someone be too
much himself  
 i think i wanted to ask you that  
 are we discussing your uncle charles  
 hey moms  
she pretends to knock her forehead at being obtuse   mario love o  are you sad  are you trying to determine whether i ve
been sensing that you yourself are sad  
mario s gaze keeps going from avril to the window behind her  he can activate the bolex s foot treadle with his hands  if
necessary  the center courts  towering lights cast an odd pall up and out into the night  the sky has a wind in it  and dark thin
high clouds whose movement s pattern has a kind of writhing weave  all this is visible out past the faint reflections of the lit room 
and up  the tennis lights  odd small lumes like criss crossing spots 
 though of course the sun would leave my sky if i couldn t assume you d simply come and tell me you were sad  there would
be no need for intuition about it  
and plus then to the east  past all the courts  you can see some lights in houses in the enfield marine complex below  and
beyond that commonwealth s cars  headers and store lights and the robed lit lady s downcast looking statue atop st  elizabeth s
hospital  out the right to the north over lots of different lights is the red rotating tip of the wyyy transmitter  its spin s ring of red
reflected in the visible charles river  the charles tumid with rain and snowmelt  illumined in patches by headlights on memorial
and the storrow      the river unwinding  swollen and humped  its top a mosaic of oil rainbows and dead branches  gulls asleep or
brooding  bobbing  head under wing 
the dark had a distanceless shape  the room s ceiling might as well have been clouds 
 skkkkk  
 booboo  
 skk kkk  
 mario  
 hal  
 were you asleep there  boo  
 i don t think i was  
 cause i don t want to wake you up if you were  
 is it dark or is it me  

  the sun won t be up for a while  i don t think  
 so it s dark then  
 booboo  i just had a wicked awful dream  
 you were saying  thank you sir may i have another  several times  
 sorry boo  
 numerous times  
 sorry  
 i think i slept right through it  
 jesus  you can hear schacht snoring all the way across  you can feel the snores  vibrations in your midsection  
 i slept right through it  i didn t hear you even come in  
 quite a nice surprise to come in and see the good old many pillowed mario shape in his rack again  
     
 i hope you didn t move the bag back here just because it sounded like i might have been asking you  to  
 i found somebody with tapes of old psychosis  for until the return  i need you to show me how to ask somebody i don t know
to borrow tapes  if we re both devoted  
     
 hey hal  
 booboo  i dreamed i was losing my teeth  i dreamed that my teeth dry rotted somehow into shale and splintered when i ate or
spoke  and i was jettisoning fragments all over the place  and there was a long scene where i was pricing dentures  
 all night last night people were coming up going where is hal  have you seen hal  what happened with ct and the urine
doctor and hal s urine  moms asked me where s hal  and i was surprised at that because of how she makes it a big point never to
check up  
 then  without any sort of dream segue  i m sitting in a cold room  naked as a jaybird  in a flame retardant chair  and i keep
receiving bills in the mail for teeth  a mail carrier keeps knocking on the door and coming in without being invited and presenting
me with various bills for teeth  
 she wants you to know she trusts you at all times and you re too trustworthy to worry about or check up on  
 only not for any teeth of mine  boo  the bills are for somebody else s teeth  not my teeth  and i can t seem to get the mail
carrier to acknowledge this  that they re not for my teeth  
 i promised lamont chu i d tell him whatever information you told me  he was so concerned  
 the bills are in little envelopes with plasticized windows that show the addressee part of the bills  i put them in my lap until
the stack gets so big they start to slip off the top and fall to the floor  
 lamont and me had a whole dialogue about his concerns  i like lamont a lot  
 booboo  do you happen to remember s  johnson  
 s  johnson used to be the moms s dog  that passed away  
 and you remember how he died  then  
 hey hal  you remember a period in time back in weston when we were little that the moms wouldn t go anywhere without s 
johnson  she took him with her to work  and had that unique car seat for him when she had the volvo  before himself had the
accident in the volvo  the seat was from the fisher price company  we went to himself s opening of kinds of light at the
hayden       that wouldn t let in cigarettes or dogs and the moms brought s  johnson in a blind dog s harness collar that went
all the way around his chest with the square bar on the leash thing and the moms wore those sunglasses and looked up and to the
right the whole time so it looked like she was legally blind so they d let s j  into the hayden with us  because he had to be there 
and how himself just thought it was a good one on the hayden  he said  
 i keep thinking about orin and how he stood there and lied to her about s  johnson s map getting eliminated  
 she was sad  
 i ve been thinking compulsively about orin ever since c t  called us all in  when you think about orin what do you think 
boo  
 the best was remember when she had to fly and wouldn t put him in a cagey box and they wouldn t even let a blind dog on
the plane  so she d leave s  johnson and leave him out tied to the volvo and she d make orin put a phone out there with its
antenna up during the day out by where s  johnson was tied to the volvo and she d call on the phone and let it ring next to s 
johnson because she said how s  johnson knew her unique personal ring on the phone and would hear the ring and know that he
was thought about and cared about from afar  she said  
 she was unbent where that dog was concerned  i remember  she bought some kind of esoteric food for it  remember how
often she bathed it 
     
 what was it with her and that dog  boo  
 and the day we were out rolling balls in the driveway and orin and marlon were there and s  johnson was there lying there
on the driveway tied to the bumper with the phone right there and it rang and rang and orin picked it up and barked into it like a
dog and hung it up and turned it off  
     
 so she d think it was s  johnson  the joke that orin thought was such a good one  
 jesus  boo  i don t remember any of that  
 and he said we d get indian rub burns down both arms if we didn t pretend how we didn t know what she was talking about
if and when she asked us about the bark on the phone when she got home 
 the indian rub burns i remember far too well  
 we were supposed to shrug and look at her like she was minus cards from her deck  or else  
 orin lied with a really pathological intensity  growing up  is what i ve been remembering  

  he made us laugh really hard a lot of times  though  i miss him  
 i don t know whether i miss him or not  
 i miss family trivia  do you remember four times he let us sit in on when they played family trivia  
 you ve got a phenomenal memory for this stuff  boo  
     
 you probably think i m wondering why you don t ask me about the thing with c t  and pemulis and the impromptu urine 
after the eschaton debacle  where the urologist took us right down to the administrative loo and was going to watch personally
while we filled his cups  like watch it go in  the urine  to make sure it came from us personally  
 i think i especially have a phenomenal memory for things i remember that i liked  
 you can ask  if you like  
 hey hal  
 the key datum is that the o n a n t a  guy didn t actually extract urine samples from us  we got to hold on to our urine  as
the moms no doubt knows quite well  don t kid yourself  from c t  
 i have a phenomenal memory for things that make me laugh is what i think it is  
 that pemulis  without self abasement or concession of anything compromising  got the guy to give us thirty days   the
fundraiser  the what aburger  thanksgiving break  then pemulis  axford and i pee like racehorses into whatever sized
receptacles he wants  is the arrangement we made  
 i can hear schacht  you re right  also the fans  
 boo  
t like the fans  sound at night  do you  it s like somebody big far away goes like  it sokit sokit sokit sok  over and over 
from very far away  
 pemulis   the alleged weak stomached clutch artist   pemulis showed some serious brass under pressure  standing there
over that urinal  he played the o n a n t a  man like a fine instrument  i found myself feeling almost proud for him  
     
 you might think i m wondering why you aren t asking me why thirty days  why it was so important to extract thirty days
from the blue blazered guy before a g c  m s  scan  as in what is there to be afraid of  you might ask  
 hal  pretty much all i do is love you and be glad i have an excellent brother in every way  hal  
 jesus  it s just like talking to the moms with you sometimes  boo  
 hey hal  
 except with you i can feel you mean it  
 you re up on your elbow  you re on your side  facing my way  i can see your shadow  
 how does somebody with your kind of panglossian constitution determine whether you re ever being lied to  i sometimes
wonder  booboo  like what criteria brought to bear  intuition  induction  reductio  what  
 you always get hard to understand when you re up on your side on your elbow like this  
 maybe it just doesn t occur to you  even the possibility  maybe it s never once struck you that something s being fabricated 
misrepresented  skewed  hidden  
 hey hal  
 and maybe that s the key  maybe then whatever s said to you is so completely believed by you that  what  it becomes sort of
true in transit  flies through the air toward you and reverses its spin and hits you true  however mendaciously it comes off the
other person s stick  
     
 you know  for me  boo  people seem to lie in different but definite ways  i ve found  maybe i can t change the spin the way
you can  and this is all i ve been able to do  is assemble a kind of field guide to the different kinds of ways  
     
 some people  from what i ve seen  boo  when they lie  they become very still and centered and their gaze very concentrated
and intense  they try to dominate the person they lie to  the person to whom they re lying  another type becomes fluttery and
insubstantial and punctuates his lie with little self deprecating motions and sounds  as if credulity were the same as pity  some
bury the lie in so many digressions and asides that they like try to slip the lie in there through all the extraneous data like a tiny
bug through a win dowscreen  
 except orin used to end up telling the truth even when he didn t think he was  
 would that that were a trait family wide  boo  
 maybe if we call him he ll come to the whataburger  you can see him if you want to if you ask  maybe  
 then there are what i might call your kamikaze style liars  these ll tell you a surreal and fundamentally incredible lie  and
then pretend a crisis of conscience and retract the original lie  and then offer you the lie they really want you to buy instead  so the
real lie ll appear as some kind of concession  a settlement with truth  that type s mercifully easy to see through  
 the merciful type of lie  
 or then the type who sort of overelaborates on the lie  buttresses it with rococo formations of detail and amendment  and
that s how you can always tell  pemulis was like that  i always thought  til his performance over the urinal  
 rococo s a pretty word  
 so now i ve established a subtype of the over elaborator type  this is the liar who used to be an over elaborator and but has
somehow snapped to the fact that rococo elaborations give him away every time  so he changes and now lies tersely  sparely 
seeming somehow bored  like what he s saying is too obviously true to waste time on  
     
 i ve established that as a sort of subtype    you sound like you can always tell  
 pemulis could have sold that urologist land in there  boo  it was an incredibly high pressure moment  i never thought he had
it in him  he was nerveless and stomachless  he projected a kind of weary pragmatism the urologist found impossible to discount 

 his face was a brass mask  it was almost frightening  i told him i never would have believed he had that kind of performance in
him  
 psychosis live on the radio used to read an eve arden beauty brochure all the time where eve arden says   the importance
of a mask is to increase your circulation   quote  
 the truth is nobody can always tell  boo  some types are just too good  too complex and idiosyncratic  their lies are too close
to the truth s heart for you to tell  
 i can t ever tell  you wanted to know  you re right  it never crosses my mind  
     
 i m the type that d buy land  i think  
 you remember my hideous phobic thing about monsters  as a kid  
 boy do i ever  
 boo  i think i no longer believe in monsters as faces in the floor or feral infants or vampires or whatever  i think at seventeen
now i believe the only real monsters might be the type of liar where there s simply no way to tell  the ones who give nothing
away  
 but then how do you know they re monsters  then  
 that s the monstrosity right there  boo  i m starting to think  
 golly ned  
 that they walk among us  teach our children  inscrutable  brass faced  
 can i ask you how it is being in that thing  
thing  
 you know  don t play dumb and embarrass me  
 a wheelchair is a thing which  you prefer it or do not prefer  it is no distance  difference  you are in the chair even if you do
not prefer it  so it is better to prefer  no  
 i can t believe i m drinking  there s all these people in the house they re always worried they re going to drink  i m in there
for drugs  i ve never had more than a beer ever in my life  i only came in here to throw up from getting mugged  some street guy
was offering to be a witness and he would not leave me alone  i didn t even have any money  i came in here to vomit  
 i know what it is you are meaning  
 what s your name one more time  
 i call myself remy  
 this is a beautiful thing as hester would say  i don t feel horrid anymore  ramy i feel better than i feel  felt in ever so i don t
know how long  this is like novocaine of the soul  i m like  why was i spending all that time doing one hitters when this is really
what   call feeling better  
 us  i do not take any drugs  i drink infrequently  
 well you re making up for lost time i have to say  
 when i drink i have many drinks  this is how it is for my people  
 my mom won t even have it in the house  she said it s what made her father drive into concrete and wipe out his entire
family  which like i m so tired of hearing it  i came in here   what is this place  
 this  it is ryle s inman square club of jazz  my wife is dying at home in my native province  
 there s this thing in the big book they make us every sunday we have to drag ourselves out of bed at the absolute crack of
dawn and sit in a circle and read out of it and half the people can barely even read and it s excruciating to listen to  
 you should make your voice lower  for in the hours of no jazz they enjoy low voices  coming in for quiet  
 and there s a thing about a car salesman trying to quit drinking  it s about the they call it the insanity of the first one  drink  
he comes in a bar for a sandwich and a glass of milk   are you hungry  
 non  
 what am i saying i don t have any money  i don t even have my purse  this stuff makes you stupid but it makes you feel
quite a bit improved  he wasn t thinking of a drink and then all of a sudden he thinks of a drink  this guy  
 out of a blue place  in one flashing instant  
 exactly  but the insanity is after all this time in hospitals and losing his business and his wife because of drinking he
suddenly gets it into his head that one drink won t hurt him if he puts it in a glass of milk   
 crazy in his head  
 so when this absolutely reptilian character you saved me from by sitting down  rolling over  whatever  sor ry  when he says
can he buy me a drink the book flashes in my mind and for sort of as it felt like a joke i ordered kahlua and milk  
 me  i come in for nights i am tired  after the music has packed away  for the quiet  i use the telephone here as well 
sometimes  
 i mean even before the mugging i was walking along soberly deciding how to kill myself  so it seems a little silly to worry
about drinking  
 you have a certain expression of resemblance of my wife  
 your wife is dying  jesus i m sitting here laughing and your wife is dying  i think it s that i haven t felt decent in so freaking
long  do you know what i m saying  i m not talking like good  i m not talking like pleasure  i wouldn t want to go overboard with
this thing  but at least at like zero  even  what do they call it feeling no pain  
 i know of this meaning  i am spending a day to find someone i think my friends will kill  all the time i am awaiting the
chance to betray my friends  and i come here and telephone to betray them and i see this bruised person who strongly resembles
my wife  i think  remy  it is time for many drinks  
 well   think you re nice  i think you just about saved my life  i ve spent like nine weeks feeling so bad i wanted to just about
kill myself  both getting high and not  dr  garton never mentioned this  he talked plenty about shock but he never even freaking
mentioned kahlua and milk  

  katherine  i will tell you a story about feeling so bad and saving a life  i do not know you but we are drunk together now  and
will you hear this story  
 it s not about hitting bottom ingesting any sort of substance and trying to surrender  is it  
 my people  we do not hit the bottoms of women  i am  shall we say  swiss  my legs  they were lost in the teenage years being
struck by a train  
 that must have smarted  
 i would have temptation to say you have no idea  but i am sensing you have an idea of hurting  
 you have no idea  
 i am in early twenty years  without the legs  many of my friends also  without legs  
 must have been an awful train crash  
 also my own father  dead when his kenbeck pacemaker came within range of a misdialed number of a cellular phone far
away in trois rivieres  in a freakish occurrence of tragedy  
 my dad emotionally abandoned us and moved to portland  which is in oregon  with his therapist  
 also in this time  my swiss nation  we are a strong people but not strong as a nation  surrounded by strong nations  there is
much hatred of our neighbors  and unfairness  
 it all started when my mom found a picture of his therapist in his wallet and goes  what s that doing in here    
 it is  for me  who i am weak  so painful to be without legs in the early twenty years  one feels grotesque to people  one s
freedom is restricted  i have no chances now for jobs in the mines of switzerland  
 the swiss have gold mines  
 as you say  and much beautiful territory  which the stronger nations at the time of losing my legs committed paper atrocities
to my nation s land  
trucking bastards  
 it is a long story to the side of this story  but my part of the swiss nation is in my time of no legs invaded and despoiled by
stronger and evil hated and neighboring nations  who claim as in the anschluss of hitler that they are friends and are not invading
the swiss but conferring on us gifts of alliance  
 total dicks  
 it is to the side  but for my swiss friends and myself without legs it is a dark period of injustice and dishonor  and of terrible
pain  some of my friends roll themselves off to fight against the invasion of paper  but me  i am too painful to care enough to
fight  to me  the fight seems without point  our own swiss leaders have been subverted to pretend the invasion is alliance  we
very few legless young cannot repel an invasion  we cannot even make our government admit that there is an invasion  i am weak
and  in pain  see all is pointless  i do not see the meaning of choosing to fight  
 you re depressed is what you are  
 i see no point and do no work and belong to nothing  i am alone  i think of death  i do nothing but frequently drink  roll
around the despoiled countryside  sometimes dodging falling projectiles of invasion  thinking of death  bemoaning the depredation
of the swiss land  in great pain  but it is myself i bemoan  i have pain  i have no legs  
 i m identifying every step of the way with you  ramy  oh god  what did i say  
 and us  our swiss countryside is very hilly  the fauteuil  it is hard to push up many hills  then one is braking with all the
might to keep from flying out of control on the downhill  
 sometimes it s like that walking  too  
 katherine  i am  in english  moribund  i have no legs  no swiss honor  no leaders who will fight the truth  i am not alive 
katherine  i roll from skiing lodge to tavern  frequently drinking  alone  wishing for my death  locked inside my pain in the heart 
i wish for my death but have not the courage to make actions to cause death  i twice try to roll over the side of a tall swiss hill but
cannot bring myself  i curse myself for cowardice and inutile  i roll about  hoping to be hit by a vehicle of someone else  but at the
last minute rolling out of the path of vehicles on autoroutes  for i am unable to will my death  the more pain in my self  the more
i am inside the self and cannot will my death  i think  i feel i am chained in a cage of the self  from the pain  unable to care or
choose anything outside it  unable to see anything or feel anything outside my pain  
 the billowing shaped black sailing wing  i am so totally identifying it s not even funny  
 my story it was one day at the top of a hill i had drunkenly labored for many minutes to roll to the crest  and looking out over
the downhill slope i see a small hunched woman in what i am thinking is a metal hat far below at the bottom  attempting the
crossing of the swiss provincial autoroute at the bottom  in the middle of the provincial autoroute  this woman  standing and
staring in the terror at one of the hated long and shiny many wheeled trucks of our paper invaders  bearing down upon her at high
speeds in the hurry to come despoil part of the swiss land  
 like one of those swiss metal helmets  is she scrambling crazily to get out of the way  
 she is standing transfixed with horror of the truck   identically as i had been motionless and transfixed by horror inside me 
unable to move  like one of the many moose of switzerland transfixed by the headlights of one of the many logging trucks of
switzerland  the sunlight is reflecting madly on her metal hat as she is shaking her head in terror and she is clutching her  
pardon me  but her female bosom  as if the heart of her would explode from the terror  
 and you think  oh fuck me  just great  another horrible thing i m going to have stand here and witness and then go feel pain
over  
 but the great gift of this time today at the hilltop above the provincial autoroute is i do not think of me  i do not know this
woman or love her  but without thinking i release my brake and i am careening down the downhill  almost wipe outing numerous
places on the bumps and rocks of the hill s slope  and as we say in switzerland i schussch at enough speed to reach my wife and
sweep her up into the chair and roll across the provincial auto route into the embanking ahead just ahead of the nose of the truck 
which had not slowed  
 hang me upside down and fuck me in both ears  you pulled yourself out of a clinical depression by being a freaking hero  
 we rolled and tumbled down the embanking on the autoroute s distant side  causing my chair to tip and injuring a stump of

 me  and knocking away her thick metal hat  
 you saved somebody s freaking life  ramy  i d give my left nut for a chance to pull myself out of the shadow of the wing that
way  ramy  
 you are not seeing this  it was this frozen with the terror woman  she saved my life  for this saved my life  this moment
broke my moribund chains  katherine  in one instant and without thought i was allowed to choose something as more important
than my thinking of my life  her  she allowed this will without thinking  she with one blow broke the chains of the cage of pain at
my half a body and nation  when i had crawled back to my fauteuil and placed my tipped fauteuil aright and i was again seated i
realized the pain of inside no longer pained me  i became  then  adult  i was permitted leaving the pain of my own loss and pain at
the top of switzerland s mont papineau  
 because suddenly you gazed at the girl without her metal hat and felt a rush of passion and fell madly in love enough to get
married and roll together off into the s  
 she had no skull  this woman  later i am learning she had been among the first swiss children of southwestern switzerland
to become born without a skull  from the toxicities in association of our enemy s invasion on paper  without the confinement of
the metal hat the head hung from the shoulders like the half filled balloon or empty bag  the eyes and oral cavity greatly distended
from this hanging  and sounds exiting this cavity which were difficult to listen  
 but still  something about her moved you to fall madly in love  her gratitude and humility and acceptance and that kind of
quiet dignity really horribly handic  birth defected people usually have  
 it was not mad  i had already chosen  the unclamping of the brakes of the fauteuil and schussching to the autoroute   this
was the love  i had chosen loving her above my lost legs and this half a self  
 and she looked at your missing limbs and didn t even see them and chose you right back   result  passionate love  
 there was for this woman in the embanking no possible choosing  without the containing helmet all energies in her were
committed to the shaping of the oral cavity in a shape that allowed breathing  which was a task of great enormity  for her head it
had also neither muscles nor nerves  the special hat had found itself dented in upon one side  and i had not the ability to shape my
wife s head into a shape that i could stuff the sac of her head into the hat  and i chose to carry her over my shoulders in a highspeed rolling to the nearest swiss hopital specializing in deformities of grave nature  it was there i learned of the other troubles  
 i think i d like a couple more kahlua and milks  
 there was the trouble of the digestive tracking  there were seizures also  there were progressive decays of circulation and
vessel  which calls itself restenosis  there were the more than standard accepted amounts of eyes and cavities in many different
stages of development upon different parts of the body  there were the fugue states and rages and frequency of coma  she had
wandered away from a public institution of swiss charitable care  worst for choosing to love was the cerebro and spinal fluids
which dribbled at all times from her distending oral cavity  
 and but your passionate love for each other dried up her cerebro spinal drool and ended the seizures and there were certain
hats she looked so good in it just about drove you mad with love  is that it  
 gar on  
 is the madly in love part coming up  
 katherine  i had too believed there was no love without passion  pleasure  this was part of the pain of the no legs  this fear
that for me there would be no passion  the fear of the pain is many times worse than the pain of the pain  n est ce    
 ramy i don t think i m like thinking this is a feel better story at all  
 i tried to leave the soft head and cerebro spinally incontinent woman  m epouse au future  behind at the hopital of grave
nature and to wheel off into my new life of uncaged acceptance and choice  i would roll into the fraying of battle for my despoiled
nation  for now i saw the point not of winning but of choosing merely to fight  but i had travelled no more than several
revolutions of the fauteuil when the old despair of before choosing this no skull creature rose up once again inside me  within
several revolutions there was no point again and no legs  and only fear of the pain that made me not choose  pain rolled me
backwards to this woman  my wife  
 you re saying this is love  this isn t love  i ll know when it s love because of the way it ll feel  it won t be about spinal fluid
and despair believe you me  bucko  it ll be about your eyes meet across someplace and both your knees give out and from that
second forward you know you re not going to be alone and in hell  you re not half the guy i started to think you might have been 
ray  
 i had to face  i had chosen  my choice  this was love  i had chosen i think the way out of the chains of the cage  i needed this
woman  without her to choose over myself  there was only pain and not choosing  rolling drunkenly and making fantasies of
death  
 this is love  it s like you were chained to her  it s like if you tried to get on with your own life the pain of the clinical
depression came back  it s like the clinical depression was a shotgun nudging you down the wedding aisle  was there a wedding
aisle  could she even get down a wedding aisle  
 my wife s wedding helmet was of the finest nickel mined and molded by friends in the nickel mines of southwest
switzerland  each of us  we were rolled down the aisle in special conveyings  hers with special pans and drains  for the fluids  it
was the happiest day ever for me  since the train  the cleric asked did i choose this woman  there was a long time of silence  my
whole very being came to a knifelike point in that instant  katharine  my hand holding tenderly the hook of my wife  
 hook  as in hand hook  
 i have been knowing since the wedding night her death was coming  her restenosis of the heart  it is irreversible  now my
gertraude  she has been in a comatose and vegetating state for almost one year  this coma has no exit  it is said  the advanced
jaarvik ix exterior artificial heart is said by the public aid cardiologists of switzerland to be her chance for life  with it they say
my wife can live for many more years in a comatose and vegetated state  
 so you re down here like pressing your case to the jaarvik ix people at harvard or wherever  
 it is for her i betray my friends and cell  the cause of my nation  which now that victory and independence of the neighbors is
possible i am betraying it  

  you re spying and betraying switzerland to try and keep alive somebody with a hook and spinal fluid and no skull in an
irreversible coma  and i thought   was disturbed  you re making me totally reorient my idea of disturbed  mister  
 i am not telling for disturbing you  poor katherine  i am telling of pain and saving a life  and love  
 well  ray  far be it from far for me  but that s not love  that s low self esteem and self abuse and settling for less  choosing
a coma over your comrades  assuming you re even not totally lying to get me into the hay or some fucked up disturbed sicko shit
like that  
this   
 which i ve got to tell you  saying i remind you of her isn t exactly the way to sweep my feet off  you know what i m saying
here  
 this is what is hard to tell  to ask any person to see  it is no choice  it is not choosing gertraude over the a f r   my
companions  over the causes  choosing gertraude to love as my wife was necessary for the others  these other choices  without
the choice of her life there are no other choices  i tried leaving at the commencement  i got only very few revolutions of the
fauteuil  
 sounds more like a gun to your head than a choice  if you can t choose the other way  there s no choice  
 no  but this choice  katherine  i made it  it chains me  but the chains are of my choice  the other chains  no  the others were
the chains of not choosing  
 do you have a twin that just came in and sat down just to the left of you but is also like about one third overlapping on you  
 you are merely drunk  this will happened quickly if unused to alcohol  nausea often accompanies this  do not be alarmed if
there is visual doubling  losing balance  and nausea of the stomach  
 the price of a like complete normal human digestive tract  i used to throw up every morning without drinking  rain and
shine both  
 you think there is no love without the pleasure  the no choice compelling of passion  
 i appreciate the drinks and all  but i don t think i m going to like memorize a lecture on love from somebody who marries
somebody with cerebro fluid spewing out of their mouth  no offense intended  
 as you say  my opinions are only that the love you of this country speak of yields none of the pleasure you seek in love  this
whole idea of the pleasure and good feelings being what to choose  to give yourself away to  that all choice for you leads there
  this pleasure of not choosing  
 don t grudge me a little feeling good  of all people  ray  asshole  shit puddle  swisshead  
     
 is it better to throw up right away or try to wait before you throw up  mr  drinking expert  
 i am thinking  what if i were to claim we might leave and i could lead you only three streets from here and show you
something with this promise  you would feel more good feeling and pleasure than ever before for you  you would never again feel
sorrow or pity or the pain of the chains and cage of never choosing  i am thinking of this offer  you would reply to me what  
 i voot make ze hreply zat i ve heard that one before  asshole  and from      from guys with a little more to them south of the
waist  if you follow  
 i do not understand  
 what i d reply is i m a shitty lay  as in sex partner  i ve only ever been sexual twice  and both times it was awful  and brad
anderson when i called and said why didn t you call again brad anderson you know what he said  he said i was a lousy lay and
my snatch was sure awful big for somebody with such a little flat ass  brad anderson said  
 no  no  you are not understanding  
 that s just what i said  
 you would say no thank you  you are saying  but this is because you would not believe my claim  
     
 if my claim  it was true  you would say yes  katherine  no  
     
 yes  
 now you re not on your side anymore  hal  i can see  when you re on your back you don t have a shadow  
     
 hey hal  
 yes  mario  
 i m sorry if you re sad  hal  you seem sad  
 i smoke high resin bob hope in secret by myself down in the pump room off the secondary maintenance tunnel  i use
visine and mint toothpaste and shower with irish spring to hide it from almost everyone  only pemulis knows the true extent  
     
 i m not the one c t  and the moms want gone  i m not the one they suspect  pemulis publicly dosed his opponent at port
washington  it was impossible to miss  the kid was a devout mormon  the dose was impossible to miss  sales of visine bottles
of pre adolescent urine during quarterly tests have been noted  it turns out  and classed as a pemulis production  
 selling visine bottles  
 i d be immune to expulsion anyway  obviously  as the moms s relative  but i m suspected of nothing other than ill considered
moral paralysis out there on i  day  my urine and axhandle s urine are just to establish a context of objectivity for pemulis s urine 
it s pemulis they want  i m almost positive they re going to give pemulis the shoe by the end of the term  i don t know whether
pemulis knows this or not  
 hey hal  
 normally they re after steroids  endocrine synthetics  mild  drines  when they test  the o n a n t a  guy gave indications
this one ll be a full spectrum scan  gas chromatography followed by electron bombardment  with spectrometer readings on the
resultant mass fragments  the real mccoy  the kind the show uses  

  hey hal  
 mike stands there and says what if hypothetically somebody was downwind from substances and got exposed and so on 
claimed vague memories of a poppy seed bagel  not at all pemulis s normal rococo type of lie  this one had a kind of weary
earnestness  the guy in the blazer said he d go ahead and give us thirty days before a full spectrum scan  mike had pointed out
that there was an enormous lady from moment due to arrive and snuffle around  making it a really unfortunate time for any
outside chance inadvertent scandals for anybody  it was like the guy needed hardly any prodding to give us time to clean out the
system  o n a n t a  doesn t want to catch anybody  really  good clean fun and so on and so forth  
     
 the ingenious layer to the lie was that the guy thought the thirty days  grace was for pemulis  that it was what pemulis
needed  pemulis could pass a urine test hanging upside down in a high wind  guy watching or not  he has a whole unpleasant
catheterization technique you don t want to hear about  he s checked it  and tenuates are apparently the indy type car of  drines 
he says  his own urine can be all innocent and pale with two days 
warning  as long as he stays off the bob  
     
 booboo  the thirty days was actually for me  and mike let me stand there with my unit out and not say anything while he
sold the urologist land and magazine subscriptions and ginsu knives  he did it for me  and i m not even the one they want  
 you can tell me whatever you said  
 what i do in secret  boo  mike says no more than thirty days to get it all out for sure  cranberry juice  calli tea  vinegar in
water  plus or minus a couple days  the bob hope i smoke and hide  boo  it s fat soluble  it stays in there  in the body s fat  
 mrs  clarke told bridget the human brain is high in fat  bridget said  
 mario  if i get caught  if i come up dirty urined in front of o n a n t a   what could c t  do  it s not just that i d lose my
even year in    s  he d have to give me the shoe if he d brought o n a n t a  into it  and what about himself s memory  i m
directly related to himself  not to mention orin  and meanwhile here s this moment lady lumbering around looking for family
linen  
 troeltsch says she all she wants to do is soften orin s profile  
 the hideous thing is how brightly it d come out  if i flunk a urine 
e t a  ll be publicly hurt  hence himself s memory  hence himself  
     
 and it d kill the moms  mario  it d be a terrible kertwang on the moms  not so much the hope  the secrecy of it  that i hid it
from her  that she ll feel i had to hide it from her  
 hey hal  
 something terrible will happen if she finds out i hid it from her  
 thirty days is one calendar month of calli tea and juice  you re saying  
 of tea and vinegar and total abstinence  of no substances whatsoever  of abrupt and total withdrawal while i try to justify my
seed at the whataburger and maybe get offered up to wayne at the fundraiser  and then your birthday in two weeks  
 hey hal  
 jesus and then the sat s in december  i ll have to finish prepping for the boards and then take the boards while still in
abrupt withdrawal  
 you ll get a perfect score  everybody s betting you get a perfect score  i ve heard them  
 marvelous  that s just exactly what i need to hear  
 hey hal  
 and of course you re hurt  boo  that i ve tried to hide all of it from you  
 i m zero percent hurt  hal  
 and of course you re wondering why i didn t just tell you when of course you knew anyway  knew something  the times
hanging upside down in the weight room with a forehead lyle didn t even want to get near  you sitting there letting me say i was
just really really tired and nightmare ridden  
 i feel like you always tell me the truth  you tell me when it s right to  
 marvelous  
 i feel like you re the only one who knows when it s right to tell  i can t know for you  so why should i be hurt  
 be a fucking human being for once  boo  i room with you and i hid it from you and let you worry and be hurt that i was
trying to hide it  
 i wasn t hurt  i don t want you to be sad  
 you can get hurt and mad at people  boo  news flash at almost fucking nineteen  kid  it s called being a person  you can get
mad at somebody and it doesn t mean they ll go away  you don t have to put on a moms act of total trust and forgiveness  one
liar s enough  
 you re scared your pee might still flunk after one calendar month  
 jesus it s like talking to a big poster of some smily faced guy  are you in there  
 and you can t use a visine bottle of pee because the man will be right there looking at your penis  and trevor and pemulis s
penises  
 the sun s thinking about coming up in the window  you can see it

   november year of the depend adult undergarment
in don gately s medical absence  johnette f  had worked five straight night shifts on dream duty and was in the front office
just after      writing up the previous night in the log  trying to think of synonyms for boredom and periodically dipping a finger
in her scalding coffee to stay awake  plus listening to distant toilets flush and showers hiss and residents clunking sleepily around
in the kitchen and dining room and everything like that  when somebody all of a sudden starts knocking at the house s front door 
which meant that the person was like a newcomer or stranger  since people in the ennet house recovery community know that the
front door s unlocked at      and always completely open to all but the law as of      
the residents these days all know not to answer any knocks at the door themselves 
so johnette f  at first thought it might be some more of those kind of police       that wore suits and ties  come to depose
more residents as witnesses on the lenz and gately and canadian fuck up and everything like that  and johnette got out the
clipboard with the names of all the residents with unresolved legal issues who needed to be put upstairs out of sight before any
police were let on the premises  a couple of the residents on the list were in the dining room in full view  eating cereal and
smoking  johnette carried the clipboard as a kind of emblem of authority as she went to the window by the front door to check out
the knocking party and everything like that 
and but the kid at the door there was no way he was police or court personnel  and johnette opened the unlocked door and let
him in  not bothering to explain that nobody had to knock  it was an upscale kid about johnette s own age or slightly less 
coughing against the foyer s pall of a m  smoke  saying he wanted to speak in comparative private to someone in whatever passed
here for authority  he said  this kid he had the sort of cool aluminum sheen of an upscale kid  a kid with either a weird tan or a
weird windburn on top of a tan  and just the whitest nike hightops johnette had ever seen  and ironed jeans  as in with like a
crease down the front  and a weird woolly white jacket with a t e  in red up one sleeve and in gray up the other  and slicked back
dark hair that was wet  as in showered and not oil  and had half frozen  the hair  in the early outside cold and was standing up
straight and frozen in front  making his dark face look small  his ears looked inflamed from the cold  johnette appraised him
coolly  digging at her ear with a pinkie  she watched the boy s face as david krone came scuttling over like a crab and blinked at
the boy upside down a few times and scuttled around and up the stairs  his forehead clunking against each stair  it was pretty
obvious the boy wasn t any resident s like homey or boyfriend come to give somebody a ride to work or like that  the way the boy
looked and stood and talked and everything like that radiated high maintenance upkeep and privilege and schools where nobody
carried weapons  pretty much a whole planet of privilege away from the planet of johnette marie foltz of south chelsea and then
the right honorable edmund f  heany facility for demonstrably incorrigible girls down in brockton  and in pat s office  with
the door only half shut  johnette gave her face the blandly hostile expression she wore around upscale boys with no tatts and all
their teeth that outside of na wouldn t have interest in her or might view her lack of front teeth and nose pin as evidence of they
were like better than her and like that  somehow  it emerged this kid didn t seem like he had enough emotional juice to be
interested in judging anybody or even noticing them  however  his talking had a burbly  oversalivated quality johnette knew all
too wicked well  the quality of somebody who d just lately put down the pipe and or bong  the kid s hair was starting to melt in
the heat of pat s office and drip and settle on his head like a slashed tire  causing that his face got bigger  he looked a little like
what the fourth mrs  foltz had called green around the gills  the boy stood there very straight with his hands behind his back and
said he lived nearby and had for some time been interested in sort of an idle  largely speculative way in considering maybe
dropping in on some sort of substance anonymous meeting and everything like that  basically as just something to do  the exact
same roundabout denial shit as persons without teeth  and said but he didn t know where any were  any meetings  or when  and
but knew the ennet house       was nearby  that dealt directly with anonymous organizations of this sort  and was wondering
whether he maybe could have   or borrow and xerox and promptly return by either e or fax or first class mail  whichever they
might prefer   some sort of relevant meeting schedule  he apologized for intruding and said but he didn t know whom else to
call  the sort of guy like ewell and day and snotty look right through you if you weren t a fucking covergirl ken e  that knew
how to long divide and say whom but didn t even know how to look up shit in the yellow pages    
much later  in subsequent events  light  johnette f  would clearly recall the sight of the boy s frozen hair slowly settling  and
how the boy had said whom  and the sight of clear upscale odor free saliva almost running out over his lower lip as he fought to
pronounce the word without swallowing 

 technical interviewers under chief of unspecified services r    the g    tine        really do do this  bring a portable highwatt lamp and plug it in and adjust its neck so the light shines down directly on the face of the interview s subject  whose homburg
and shade affording eyebrows had been removed by polite but emphatic request  and it was this  the harsh light on her fully
exposed post marxist face  more than any kind of tough noir informed grilling from r  tine jr  and the other technical
interviewer  that prompted m i t  a b d  ph d  molly notkin  fresh off the n n y c  high speed rail  seated in the sidney
peterson shaped directorial chair amid dropped luggage in her co op s darkened and lock dickied living room  to spill her guts 
roll over  eat cheese  sing like a canary  tell everything she believed she knew       
  molly notkin tells the u s o u s  operatives that her understanding of the apres garde auteur j  o  incandenza s lethally
entertaining infinite jest  v or vi  is that it features madame psychosis as some kind of maternal instantiation of the archetypal
figure death  sitting naked  corporeally gorgeous  ravishing  hugely pregnant  her hideously deformed face either veiled or
blanked out by undulating computer generated squares of color or ana morphosized into unrecognizability as any kind of face by
the camera s apparently very strange and novel lens  sitting there nude  explaining in very simple childlike language to whomever
the film s camera represents that death is always female  and that the female is always maternal  i e  that the woman who kills you
is always your next life s mother  this  which molly notkin said didn t make too much sense to her either  when she heard it  was
the alleged substance of the death cosmology madame psychosis was supposed to deliver in a lalating monologue to the viewer 
mediated by the very special lens  she may or may not have been holding a knife during this monologue  and the film s big
technical hook  the auteur s films always involved some sort of technical hook  involved some very unusual kind of single lens on
the bolex h   s turret        and it was unquestionably an f x that madame psychosis looked pregnant  because the real madame
psychosis had never been visibly pregnant  molly notkin had seen her naked        and you can always tell if a woman s ever
carried anything past the first trimester if you look at her naked       
  molly notkin tells them that madame psychosis s own mother had killed herself in a truly ghastly way with an ordinary
kitchen garbage disposal on the evening of thanksgiving day in the year of the tucks medicated pad  four odd months before
the film s auteur himself had killed himself  also with a kitchen appliance  also ghastlyly  which she says though any lincolnkennedy type connections between the two suicides will have to be ferreted out by the interviewers on their own  since as far as
molly notkin knew the two different parents didn t even know of each other s existence 
  that the lethal cartridge s digital bolex h   camera   already a rube goldbergesque amalgam of various improvements
and digital adaptations to the already modification heavy classic bolex hi  rex     a canadian line  by the way  favored
throughout his whole career by the auteur because its turret could accept three different c mount lenses and adapters  
that infinite jest  v  or  v   s had been fitted with an extremely strange and extrusive kind of lens  and lay during filming on either
the floor or like a cot or bed  the camera  with madame psychosis as the death  mother figure inclined over it  parturient and
nude  talking down to it   in both senses of the word  which from a critical perspective would introduce into the film a kind of
synesthetic double entendre involving both the aural and visual perspectives of the subjective camera   explaining to the camera
as audience synecdoche that this was why mothers were so obsessively  con sumingly  drivenly  and yet somehow narcissistically
loving of you  their kid  the mothers are trying frantically to make amends for a murder neither of you quite remember 
  molly notkin tells them she could be far more helpful and forth comingly detailed if only they d switch that beastly lamp
off or train it someplace else  which is a brass faced falsehood and dismissed as such by r  tine jr   and so the light stays right on
molly notkin s glabrous unhappy face 
  that madame psychosis and the film s auteur had not been sexually enmeshed  and for reasons beyond the fact that the
auteur s belief in a finite world total of available erections rendered him always either impotent or guilt ridden  that in fact
madame psychosis had loved and been sexually enmeshed only with the auteur s son  who  though molly notkin never
encountered him personally and madame psychosis had taken care never to speak ill of him  was clearly as thoroughgoing a little
rotter as one would find down through the whole white male canon of venery  moral cowardice  emotional chicanery  and rot 
  that madame psychosis had been present neither at the auteur s suicide nor at his funeral  that she d missed the funeral
because her passport had expired  that nor had madame psychosis been present at the reading of the late auteur s will  despite the
fact that she was one of the beneficiaries  that madame psychosis had never mentioned the fate or present disposition of the
unreleased cartridge entitled either infinite jest  v  or infinite jest  vi   and had described it only from the perspective of the
experience of performing in it  nude  and had never seen it  but had a hard time believing it was even entertaining  let alone
lethally entertaining  and tended to believe it had represented little more than the thinly veiled cries of a man at the very terminus
of his existential tether   the auteur having apparently been extremely close to his own mother  in childhood   and had no
doubt been recognized as such by the auteur   who though not exactly the psychic sea s steadiest keel had been in many respects
an acute reader and critic of film  and would have been able to distinguish the real filmic mccoy from pathetic cries veiled as film
no matter how wildly his nautical compass was spinning around  on its tether  and would in all probability have destroyed the
master print of the failed piece of art  the same way he d reportedly destroyed the first four or five failed attempts at the same
piece  which pieces had admittedly featured actresses of lesser mystique and allure 
  that the auteur s funeral had purportedly taken place in the l islet province of nouveau quebec  the birth province of the
auteur s widow  featuring an interrment and not a cremation 
  that far be it from her to tell the u s  office of unspecified services its business  but why not simply go to j o i  s widow
and verify directly the existence and location of the purported cartridge 
  that it seemed pretty unlikely to her  molly notkin  that the auteur s widow had any connections to any anti american
groups  cells  or movements  no matter what the files on her indiscreet youth might suggest  since from everything molly notkin s
heard the woman didn t have much interest in any agendas larger than her own individually neurotic agendas  even though she
came on to madame psychosis all sweet and solicitous  that madame psychosis had confessed to molly notkin that the widow
struck her as very possibly death incarnate   her constant smile the rictal smile of some kind of thanatoptic figure   and that it
had struck madame psychosis as bizarre that it was she  madame psychosis  whom the auteur kept casting as various feminine
instantiations of death when he had the real thing right under his nose  and eminently photogenic to boot  the widow to be  apparently a real restaurant silencer type beauty even in her late forties 

   that the auteur had stopped ingesting distilled spirits as madame psy chosis s personal condition for consenting to appear
in what she knew to be her but did not know to be the j o i  s final film cartridge  and that the auteur had  apparently 
incredibly        kept his side of the bargain   possibly because he d been so deeply moved at m p  s consent to appear before
the camera again even after her terrible accident and deformation and the little rotter of a son s despicable abandonment of the
relationship under the excuse of accusing madame psychosis of being sexually enmeshed with their   here molly notkin said
that she of course had meant to say his   father  the auteur  and that the auteur had apparently remained alcohol free for the
whole next three and a half months  from xmas of the year of the tucks medicated pad to   april of the year of the trial size
dove bar  the date of his suicide 
  that the completely secret and hidden substance abuse problem  the one that had now landed madame psychosis in an
elite private dependency treatment facility so elite that not even m p  s closest friends knew where it was beyond knowing only
that it was someplace far  very far away  that the abuse problem could have been nothing but a consequence of the terrible guilt
madame psychosis felt over the auteur s suicide  and constituted a clear unconscious compulsion to punish herself with the same
sort of substance abuse activity she had coerced the auteur into stopping  merely substituting narcotics for wild turkey  which
molly notkin could attest was some very gnarly tasting liquor indeed 
  no  that madame psychosis s guilt over the auteur s felo de self had nothing to do with the purportedly lethal infinite jest
 v  or  vi   which as far as madame psychosis had determined from the filming itself was little more than an olla podrida of
depressive conceits strung together with flashy lensmanship and perspectival novelty  that  no  rather the consuming guilt had
been over the condition that the auteur suspend the ingestion of spirits  which it turned out  m p  had claimed in deluded
hindsight  had been all that was keeping the man s tether ravelled  the ingestion  such that without it he was unable to withstand
the psychic pressures that pushed him over the edge into what madame psychosis said she and the auteur had sometimes referred
to as quote  self erasure  
  that it did not strike her  molly notkin  as improbable that the special limited edition turkey shaped gift bottle of wild
turkey blended whiskey brand distilled spirits with the cerise velveteen gift ribbon around its neck with the bow tucked under its
wattles on the kitchen counter next to the microwave oven before which the auteur s body had been found so ghastlyly inclined
had been placed there by the spouse s widow to be   who may well have been enraged by the fact that the auteur had never been
willing to give up spirits quote  for her  but had apparently been willing to give them up quote  for  madame psychosis and her
nude appearance in his final opus 
  that the by all reports exceptionally attractive madame psychosis had suffered an irreparable facial trauma on the same
thanksgiving day that her mother had killed herself with a kitchen appliance  leaving her  madame psychosis  hideously and
improbably deformed  and that her membership in the union of the hideously and improbably deformed s    step self help
organization was no kind of metaphor or ruse 
  that the intolerable stresses leading to the auteur s self erasure had probably way less to do with film or digital art   this
auteur s anti confluential approach to the medium having always struck molly notkin as being rather aloof and cerebrally
technical  to say nothing of naively post marxist in its self congratulatory combination of anamorphic fragmentation and antipicaresque       narrative stasis   or with having allegedly spawned some angelic monster of audience gratification   anyone
with a nervous system who watched much of his oeuvre could see that fun or entertainment was pretty low on the late filmmaker s
list of priorities   but rather much more likely to do with the fact that his widow to be was engaging in sexual enmeshments with
just about everything with a y chromo some  and had been for what sounded like many years  including possibly with the
auteur s son and madame s craven lover  as a child  seeing as it sounded like the little rotter had enough malcathected issues with
his mother to keep all of vienna humming briskly for quite some time 
  that thus   with the promethean guilt angle on the auteur s suicide cast into serious doubt   there was little question in
a b d  dr  notkin s mind that the entire perfect entertainment as lzez esioii myth surrounding the purportedly lethal final
cartridge was nothing more than a classic illustration of the antinomically schizoid function of the post industrial capitalist
mechanism  whose logic presented commodity as the escape from anxieties of mortality which escape is itself psychologicallyfatal  as detailed in perspicuous detail in m  gilles deleuze s posthumous incest and the life of death in capitalist entertainment 
which she d be happy to lend the figures standing up somewhere above the lamp s white fire  one of them tapping something
irritatingly against the lamp s conic metal shade  if they d promise to return it and not mark it up 
  that   in response to respectful but pointed requests to keep the responses on some sort of factual track and spare them
all the eggheaded abstractions   madame psychosis s deforming trauma  in its combination of coincidence and malefic intention 
had been like something right out of the auteur s most ghastly and unresolvable proto incestuous disaster films  e g  the night
wears a sombrero  dial c for concupiscence  and the unfortunate case of me  that madame psychosis  an only child  had been
extremely and heart warmingly close to her father  a low ph chemist for a kentucky reagent outfit  who d apparently had an
extremely close only child and watching movies together based relationship with his own mother and seemed to reenact the
closeness with madame psychosis  taking her to movies on a near daily basis  in kentucky  and driving her all over the mid south
for various junior baton twirling competitions while his wife  madame psychosis s mother  a devoutly religious but wounded and
neurasthenic woman with a fear of public spaces  stayed home on the family farm  canning preserves and seeing to the
administration of the farm  etc  but that things had gotten first strange and then creepy as madame psychosis entered puberty 
apparently  specifically the low ph father had gotten creepy  seeming to behave as if madame psychosis were getting younger
instead of older  taking her to increasingly child rated films at the local cineplex  refusing to acknowledge issues of menses or
breasts  strongly discouraging dating  etc  apparently issues were complicated by the fact that madame psychosis emerged from
puberty as an almost freakishly beautiful young woman  especially in a part of the united states where poor nutrition and
indifference to dentition and hygiene made physical beauty an extremely rare and sort of discomfiting condition  one in no way
shared by madame psychosis s toothless and fireplug shaped mother  who said not a word as madame psychosis s father
interdicted everything from brassieres to pap smears  addressing the nubile madame psychosis in progressively puerile baby talk
and continuing to use her childhood diminutive like pookie or putti as he attempted to dissuade her from accepting a scholarship
to a boston university whose film and film cartridge studies program was  he apparently maintained  full of quote nasty

 pootem wooky barn bams  unquote  whatever family code pejorative this signified 
  that   to cut to a chase which the interviewers  hands on hip attitudes and replacement of the lamp s bulb with a much
higher wattage signified they d very much like to see cut to   as is often the case  it wasn t until madame psychosis got to college
and gradually acquired some psychic distance and matter for emotional comparison that she even began to see how creepy her
reagent daddy s regression had been  and not until a certain major sport star son s autograph on a punctured football inspired
more e mailed suspicion and sarcasm than gratitude from home in ky that she began even to suspect that her lack of social life
throughout puberty might have had as much to do with her daddy s intrusive discouragement as with her actaeonizing pubescent
charms  that   pausing briefly to spell actaeonizing   the shit had hit the intergenerational psychic fan when madame psychosis
brought the auteur s little rotter of a son home to the ky spread for the third time  for thanksgiving in the year of the tucks
medicated pad  and witnessing her daddy s infantilizing conduct of her and her mother s wordless compulsive canning and
cooking  not to mention the terrific tension that resulted when madame psychosis attempted to move some of the stuffed animals
out of her room to make room for the auteur s son  in short experiencing her home and daddy through the comparative filter of
enmeshment with the auteur s son brought madame psychosis to the crisis that precipitates speaking the unspeakable  and that it
had been at thanksgiving dinner  at midday on    november y t m p   when the low ph daddy began not only cutting up
madame psychosis s plate s turkey for her but mashing it into puree between the tines of his fork  all under the raised comparative
eyebrows of the auteur s son  that madame psychosis finally aired the unspoken question of why  with her now of legal age and
living with a male and retired from childhood s twirling and carving out an adult career on one and potentially two sides of the
film camera  did her own personal daddy seem to feel she needed help to chew  molly notkin s secondhand take on the
emotional eruptions that ensued is not detailed  but she feels she can state w  confidence that it s plausibly a case of any kind of
system that s been under enormous silent pressure for some time  that when the system finally blows the accreted pressure s such
that it s almost always a full scale eruption  the low ph daddy s enormous stress had apparently erupted  right there at the table 
with his grown daughter s white meat between his tines  in the confession that he d been secretly  silently in love with madame
psychosis from way  way back  that the love had been the real thing  pure  unspoken  genuflectory  timeless  impossible  that he
never touched her  wouldn t  nor ogle  less out of a horror of being the sort of mid south father who touched and ogled than out of
the purity of his doomed love for the little girl he d escorted to the movies as proudly as any beau  daily  that the repression and
disguisability of his pure love hadn t been all that hard when madame psychosis had been juvenile and sexless  but that at the
onset of puberty and nubility the pressure d become so great that he could compensate only by regressing the child mentally to an
age of incontinence and pre mashed meat  and that his awareness of how creepy his denial of her maturation must have seemed  
even though neither the daughter nor mother  even now wordlessly chewing a candied yam  had remarked on it  the denial and
creepiness  although the man s beloved pointers were given to whimper and scratch at the door when the denial had gotten
especially creepy  animals being way more sensitive than humans to emotional anomalies  in molly notkin s experience    had
raised his internal limbic system s pressure to near intolerable foot kilo levels  and that he d been hanging on for dear life for the
past nigh on now a decade  but that now that he d had to actually stand witness to the removal of pooky and urgle bear et al  from
her ballerina wallpapered room to make space for a nonrelated mature male whose physical vigor through the peephole the
daddy d exerted every gram of trembling will he d possessed trying not to drill the hole in the bathroom wall just above the mirror
over the sink whose pipes made the wall behind the headboard of madame psychosis s room s bed sing and clunk  and through
which  late at night   claiming to mother a case of skitters from all the holiday nibbles   hunched atop the sink  every night
since madame psychosis and the auteur s son had first arrived to sleep together in the unstuffed animaled bed of a childhood
through which he d been all but tortured by the purity of his impossible love for the  
  that it had been at this point that madame psychosis s mother s fork and then whole plate had clattered to the floor  and
that amid the sounds of the pointers under the table fighting over that plate the mother s own denial system s pressure blew  and
she freaked  announcing publicly at the table that she and the daddy had not once known each other as man and wife since
madame psychosis had first menstruated  that she d known something incredibly creepy was going on but had denied it  evacuated
her suspicions and placed them under great pressure in the bell jar of her own denial  because  she admits   admits is probably
less accurate than something like keens or shrieks or jabbers   that her own father   an itinerant camp meeting preacher   had
molested her and her sister all through childhood  ogled and touched and worse  and that this had been why she d married at just
sixteen  to escape  and that now it was clear to her that she d married the exact same kind of monster  the kind who spurns his
ordained mate and wants his daughter 
  that she d said maybe it was her  she  the mother  who was the monster  which if so she was tired of hiding it and
appearing falsely before god and man 
  that whereupon she d reeled from her place and hurdled three pointers and run down to the daddy s acid lab in the cellar 
to disfigure herself with acid 
  that the daddy d kept a world class collection of various acids in pyrex brand flasks on wooden shelves down in the
cellar 
  that the daddy  the rotter of a son  and finally a shock slowed madame psychosis had all run down the stairs after the
mother and hit the cellar just as the mother had removed the stopper of a pyrex flask with an enormous half eaten away skull on
the side  which along with the flaming scarlet piece of litmus paper afloat inside signified an incredibly low ph and corrosive type
of acid 
  that madame psychosis s name was in reality lucille duquette  and the daddy s name either earl or al duquette of
extreme southeast ky  way down near tn and va 
  that  despite the little rotter s professions of self recrimination for allowing the deformity to take place and claim that the
swirling systems of guilt and horror and denial informed forgiveness made a committed relationship with madame psychosis
increasingly untenable  it didn t take an expert in character disorders and weaknesses to figure out why the fellow d given madame
psychosis the boot within months of the traumatic deformity  now did it 
  that  right on the hysterical cusp where internalized rage can so easily shift to externalized rage  the mother had hurled the
low ph flask at the daddy  who d reflexively ducked  and that the rotter  one orin  right behind  a former tennis champion with

 superb upper body reflexes  had instinctively ducked also  leaving madame psychosis   dazed and bradykinetic from the
sudden venting of so many high pressure repressive family systems   open for a direct facial hit  resulting in the traumatic deformity  and that it had been everyone s failure to press any charges that had liberated the mother from southeast ky custody and
allowed her access once again to her home s kitchen  where  apparently despondent  she committed suicide by putting her
extremities down the garbage disposal   first one arm and then  kind of miraculously if you think about it  the other arm

by    minutes east of natick it becomes obvious that the little booklet s terse q r s  designates a facility called quabbin
recovery systems  which is easy to find  roadside ad signs starting to announce the place several clicks away  each sign a little
different and designed to form a little like narrative of which actual arrival at q r s  would be the climax  even hal s late father
was too young really to remember burma shave signs 
quabbin recovery systems is set far back from rte     on a winding groomed gravel road flanked all the way up by classy
old time standing lanterns whose glass shades are pebbled and faceted like candy dishes and seem more for mood than
illumination  then the actual building s driveway s an even more winding little road that s barely more than a tunnel through
meditative pines and poor postured lombardy poplars  once off the highway the whole nighttime scene out here in exurbia  
boston s true boonies   seems ghostly and circumspect  hal s tires crunch cones in the road  some sort of bird shits on his
windshield  the driveway broadens gradually into a like delta and then a parking lot of mint white gravel  and the physical q r s 
is right there  cubular and brooding  the building s one of these late model undeformed cubes of rough panel brick and granite
quoins  illuminated moodily from below by more classy lanterns  it looks like a building block from some child titan s toy chest 
its windows are the smoky brown kind that in daylight become dark mirrors  hal s late father had publicly repudiated this kind of
window glass in an interview in lens   pane when the stuff first came out  right now  lit from inside  the windows have a sort of
bloody  polluted aspect 
a good two thirds of the lot s parking places say reserved for staff  which strikes hal as odd  the tow truck tends to
diesel and chuff after deignition  finally subsiding with a shuddering fart  it s dead quiet except for the hiss of light traffic down on
   past all the trees  only tp link workers and marathon type commuters live in exurban natick  it s either way colder out here or
else a front s been coming in while hal drove  the lot s piney air has the ethyl sting of winter 
q r s  s big doors and lintel are more of that reflector shade glass  there s no obvious bell  but the doors are unlocked  they
open in that sort of pressurized way of institutional doors  the savanna colored lobby is broad and still and has a vague
medical dental smell  its carpet s a dense low tan dacronyl weave that evacuates sound  there s a circular high countered nurse s

 station or reception desk  but nobody s there 
the whole place is so quiet hal can hear the squeak of blood in his head 
the   a that follows q r s  in the girl s little white booklet is presumably a room number  hal has on a non e t a  jacket
and carries the nasa glass he spits in  he d have to spit even if he didn t have chew in  the ko diak s almost like a cover or
excuse 
there is no map or you are here type directory on view in the lobby  the lobby s heat is intense and close but kind of
porous  it s in a sort of uneasy struggle with the radiant chill of all the smoked glass of the entrance  the lamps out in the lot and
off along the driveway are blobs of sepia light through the glass  inside  cove lighting at the seams of walls and ceiling produce an
indirect light that s shadowless and seems to rise from the room s objects themselves  it s the same lighting and lion colored
carpeting in the first long hall hal tries  the room numbers go up to    and then after hal turns a sharp corner start at   a  the
room doors are false blond wood but look thick and private  flush in their frames  there s also the smell of stale coffee  the walls 
color scheme is somewhere between puce and mature eggplant skin  kind of nauseous against the sandy tan of the carpet  all
buildings with any kind of health theme to them have this thin sick sweet dental sub odor to them  q r s  also seems to have
some sort of balsamy air freshener going in the ventilation system  too  but it doesn t quite cover the sweet medical stink or the
bland sour smell of institutional food 
hal hasn t heard one human sound since he came in  the place s silence has that glittery sound of total silence  his footfalls
make no sound on the dacronyl  he feels furtive and burglarish and holds the nasa glass down at his side and the na booklet
higher up and cover out as a sort of explanatory i d  there are computer enhanced landscapes on the walls  little low tables with
glossy pamphlets  a framed print of picasso s  seated harlequin   and nothing else that wasn t just institutional bullshit  visual
muzak  without any sound to his footfalls it s like the gauntlets of doors just glide by  the quiet has a kind of menace  the whole
cubular building seems to hal to hold the tensed menace of a living thing that s chosen to hold itself still  if you asked hal to
describe his feelings as he looked for room   a the best he could do would be to say he wished he were somewhere else and
feeling some way besides how he felt  his mouth pours spit  the glass s one third full and heavy in his hand and not much fun to
look at  he s missed the glass a couple of times and marred the tan carpet with dark spit  after two     turns it s clear the hallway s
run is a perfect square around the cube s ground level  he s seen no stairs or entrances to stairways  he empties the nasa glass
rather gooily into a potted rubber tree s dirt  q r s  s building may be one of those infamous rubikular cubes that looks
topologically undeformed but is actually impossible to negotiate on the inside  but the numbers after the third corner start at    
and now hal can hear either very distant or very muffled voices  he carries the na booklet in front of him like a crucifix  he has
about     u s  and another      in eagle   leaf   and broom emblemized o n a n  scrip  having had no idea what sort of introductory costs might be involved  q r s  didn t purchase prime natick acreage and the cutting edge services of a sao paulo school
geometric minimalist architect with just altruistic goodwill  that was for sure 
room   a s wood grain door was just as emphatically shut as all the others  but the muffled voices were behind this one  the
meeting was listed in the book as starting at       and it was only around       and hal thought the voices might signify some
sort of pre meeting orientation for people who ve come for the first time  sort of tentatively  just to scout the whole enterprise out 
so he doesn t knock 
he still has this intractable habit of making a move like he s straightening a bow tie before he enters a strange room 
and except for the thin rubber sheaths  the doorknobs on the quabbin recovery systems doors are the same as at e t a   
flat bars of brass toggle bolted to the latch mechanism  so you have to push the bar down instead of turning anything to open the
door 
but the meeting is under way  apparently  it isn t near big enough to create a mood of anonymity or casual spectation  nine or
ten adult middle class males are in the warm room on orange plastic chairs with legs of molded steel tubing  every one of the men
has a beard  and each wears chinos and a sweater  and they all sit the same way  that indian cross legged style with their hands on
their knees and their feet under their knees  and they all wear socks  with no footwear or winter jackets anywhere in sight  hal
eases the door shut and sort of slinks along the wall to an empty chair  all the time conspicuously brandishing the meeting booklet 
the chairs are placed in no discernible order  and their orange clashes nastily with the room s own colors  walls and ceiling the
color of thousand island dressing   a color scheme with unplaceable but uneasy associations for hal   and more of the lionskin
dacronyl carpet  and the warm air in   a is stuffy with co  and unpleasantly scented with the aroma of soft male middle aged
bodies not wearing footwear  a stale meaty cheesy smell  more nauseous even than the e t a  locker room after a mrs  clarke
tex mex fiesta 
the only guy in the meeting to acknowledge hal s entrance is at the front of the room  a man hal would have to call almost
morbidly round  his body nearly leith sized and globularly round and the smaller but still large globe of a head atop it  his socks
plaid and his legs not all the way crossable so it looks like he might pitch disastrously backward in his chair any minute  smiling
warmly at hal s winter coat and nasa glass as hal slinks and sits and slumps down low  the round man s chair is positioned
under a small white magic marker blackboard  and all the other chairs approximately face it  and the man holds a magic marker
in one hand and holds what looks quite a bit like a teddy bear to his chest with the other  and wears chinos and a cable knit
norwegian sweater the color of toast  his hair is that waxy sort of blond  and he s got the blond eyebrows and creepy blond
eyelashes and violently flushed face of a true norwegian blond  and his little beard is an imperial so sharply waxed it looks like a
truncated star  the morbidly round blond man s pretty clearly the leader of the meeting  possibly a high ranking official of
narcotics anonymous  whom hal could casually approach about tracts and texts to buy and study  afterward 
another middle aged guy up near the front is crying  and he too holds what looks like a bear 
the blond brows hike up and down as the leader says  i d like to suggest we men all hold our bears tight and let our inner
infant nonjudgmentally listen to kevin s inner infant expressing his grief and loss  
they re all at subtly different angles to hal  who s slumped low over by the wall in the second to last row  but it turns out
after some subtle casual neck craning that  sure enough  all these middle class guys in at least their thirties are sitting there
clutching teddy bears to their sweatered chests   and identical teddy bears  plump and brown and splay limbed and with a little
red corduroy tongue protruding from the mouths  so the bears all look oddly throttled  the room is menacingly quiet now except

 for the sibilance of the heating vents and the sobbing guy kevin  and the plip of hal s saliva hitting the bottom of the empty glass
rather more loudly than he might have wished 
the back of the crying guy s neck is turning redder and redder as he clutches his bear and rocks on his hams 
hal sits with his leg crossed good ankle on knee and joggles his white hightop and looks at his callused thumb and listens to
the kevin guy sob and snuffle  the guy wipes his nose with the heel of his hand just like the littler buddies at e t a  hal figures
the tears and bears have something to do with giving up drugs  and that the meeting is probably on the verge of coming around to
talking explicitly about drugs and how to give up drugs for a certain period without feeling indescribably wretched and bereft  or
maybe at least some data on how long one might expect the wretchedness of giving up drugs to continue before the old nervous
system and salivary glands returned to normal  even though inner infant sounds uncomfortably close to dr  doloros rusk s
dreaded inner child  hal d be willing to bet that here it s some sort of shorthand narcotics anonymous sobriquet for like  limbic
component of the cns  or  the part of our cortex that s not utterly wretched and bereft without the drugs that up to now have been
pulling us through the day  secretly  or some affirming  encouraging thing like that  hal wills himself to stay objective and not
form any judgments before he has serious data  hoping desperately for some sort of hopeful feeling to emerge 
the diglobular leader has made a cage of his hands and rested his hands on his teddy bear s head and is breathing slowly and
evenly  watching kevin kindly from under the blond eyebrows  looking more than anything like some sort of buddha ascalifornia surfer dude  the leader inhales gently and says  the energies i m feeling in the group are energies of unconditional love
and acceptance for kevin s inner infant   nobody else says anything  and the leader doesn t seem to need anybody to say anything 
he looks down at the cage his hands have made on the bear and keeps subtly changing the shape of the cage  the guy kevin 
whose neck is now not only beet red but shiny with embarrassed sweat between his shirt collar and hair s hem  sobs even harder at
the affirmation of love and support  the round leader s high hoarse voice had the same blandly kind didactic quality as rusk s  as
if always speaking to a not too bright child 
after some more cage play and deep breathing the leader looks up and around and nods at nothing and says  maybe we could
all name our feelings right now for kevin and share how much we re caring for him and his inner infant right now  in his pain  
various bearded cross legged guys speak up 
 i love you  kevin  
 i m not judging you  kevin  
 know just how you and the i i  feel  
 i m feeling really close to you  
 i m feeling a lot of love for you right now  kevin  
 you re crying for two  guy  
 kevin kevin kevin kevin kevin  
 i m not feeling like your crying is one bit unmanly or pathetic  fella  
it s at this point that hal begins truly to lose his willed objectivity and open mindedness and to get a bad personal feeling
about this narcotics anonymous   na   meeting  which seems already deeply under way and isn t one bit like he s imagined an
even remotely hopeful antidrug meeting would be like  it seems more like some kind of cosmetic psychology encounter thing 
not one substance or symptom of substance deprivation has been mentioned so far  and none of these guys looks like they ve
ever been engaged with anything more substantial than an occasional wine cooler  if he had to guess 
hal s grim mood deepens as the round man up front now leans precariously over and down and opens a sort of toy box under
the blackboard by his chair and produces a cheap plastic portable cd laser scanner and sets it on top of the toy box  where it
begins to issue a kind of low treacly ambient shopping mall music  mostly cello  with sporadic harps and chimes  the stuff
spreads through the hot little room like melted butter  and hal sinks lower in his orange chair and looks hard at the space andspacecraft emblem on his nasa glass 
 kevin   the leader says over the music   kevin   the sobbing man s hand lies over his face like a spider  and he doesn t even
start to look up until the leader has said several times very blandly and kindly  kevin  do you feel okay about looking at the rest of
the group  
kevin s red neck wrinkles as he looks up at the blond leader through his fingers 
the leader s made the cage again on his poor bear s squashed head   can you share what you re feeling  kevin   he says   can
you name it  
kevin s voice is muffled by the hand he hides behind   i m feeling my inner infant s abandonment and deep deprivation issues 
harv   he says  drawing shuddering breaths  his mauve sweater s shoulders tremble   i m feeling my inner infant standing holding
the bars of his crib and looking out of the bars       bars of his crib and crying for his mommy and daddy to come hold him and
nurture him   kevin sobs twice in an apneated way  one arm holds his lap s bear so tight hal thinks he can see a little stuffing start
to come out of its mouth around its tongue  and a stalactite of that clear thin weepy type mucus hangs from kevin s nose just mm 
over the throttled bear s head   and nobody s coming   he sobs   nobody s coming  i feel alone with my bear and plastic airplanemobile and teething ring  
everybody s nodding in an affirming and pained way  no two beards are exactly the same fullness and design  a couple other
sobs break out across the room  everyone s bear stares blankly ahead 
the leader s nod is slow and meditative   and can you share your needs with the group right now  kevin  
 please share  kevin   says a slim guy over by a black filing cabinet who sits like he s a veteran at sitting indian style in hard
plastic chairs 
the music s still going  going absolutely nowhere  like philip glass on quaaludes 
 the work we re here to do   the leader says over the music  one hand now pressed pensively to the side of his big face   is to
work on our dysfunctional passivity and tendency to wait silently for our inner infant s needs to be magically met  the energy i
feel in the group now is that the group is supportively asking kevin to nurture his inner infant by naming and sharing his needs
out loud with the group  and i m feeling how aware we all are how risky and vulnerable need naming out loud must feel for
kevin right now  

 everybody looks deadly serious  a couple guys are rubbing their bears  bellies pregnantly  the only really infantile thing hal
can feel inside him is the inguinal gurgle of two heavy bran muffins swallowed at high speeds w o liquid  the string of mucus
from kevin s nose trembles and swings  the slender guy who d asked kevin please to share is now waggling the arms of his teddy
bear in an infantile way  hal feels a wave of nausea flood his mouth with fresh saliva 
 we re asking you to name what your inner infant wants right now more than anything in the world   the leader s saying to
kevin 
 to be loved and held   kevin keens  sobbing harder  his lachrymucus is now a thin silver string joining his nose and the
fuzzy top of his bear s head  the bear s expression is seeming creepier to hal by the second  hal wonders what the etiquette is in
na about getting up and leaving right in the middle of somebody s infantile revelation of need  meanwhile kevin is saying that
his inner infant inside him had always hoped that some day his mom and dad would be there for him  to hold him and love him 
he says but right from the start they d never been there for him  leaving him and his brother with hispanic nannies while they
devoted themselves to their jobs and various types of psychotherapy and support groups  this takes a while to say  given all the
snuffles and wracked spasms  then kevin says but then by the time he was eight they were gone altogether  dead  smooshed by a
dysfunc tionally falling radio traffic helicopter on the jamaica way on the way to couples counselling 
at this hal s slumped head jerks up  his mouth oval with horror  he s all of a sudden realized that this guy who s seated at
such an angle that hal s been able to see only the obliquest portion of his profile is in fact kevin bain  his brother orin s old
e t a  doubles and chemical mischief partner marlon bain s older brother  kevin bain  of dedham ma  who the last hal had
heard had gotten his m b a  at wharton and cleaned up with a string of simulated reality arcades all up and down the south
shore  back during the pre subsidized time simulated reality craze  before interlace viewers and digital cartridges let you do
your own customized simulating right at home and the novelty wore off        the kevin bain whose childhood hobby was
memorizing irs capital depreciation schedules and whose adult idea of a wild time       had been putting extra marshmallows
in his nightly cocoa  and who wouldn t have known a recreational drug if it walked up and poked him in the eye  hal begins to
scan for possible exits  the only door was the one he d come in  which is in full view of most of the room  there are no windows
at all 
hal s chilled by multiple realizations  this is no na or anti substance meeting  this is one of those men s issues men smovement type meetings k  d  coyle s stepdad went to and coyle liked to mimic and parody during drills  making his stick s grip
poke out between his legs and yelling  nurture this  honor getting in touch with this  
kevin bain is wiping his nose with his poor teddy bear s head and saying it didn t look like his inner infant would ever get its
wish  the gooey music s cello sounds like some sort of cow mooing in distress  maybe at what it s in the middle of 
sure enough  the round man  whose hand s left a print on his soft cheek  asks poor old kevin bain to honor and name his i i  s
wounded wish anyway  to say  please  mommy and daddy  come love and hold me   out loud  several times  which kevin bain
goes ahead and does  rocking a little in his chair  his voice now with an edge of good old adult mortified embarrassment to it 
along with the racking sobs  a couple of the other men in the room are wiping at their bright white drug free eyes with the arms
of their teddy bears  hal is painfully reminded of the rare ziplocs of humboldt county hydroponic marijuana that pemulis
occasionally scored via fedex from his mercantile counterpart at the rolling hills academy  the curved tawny buds so big and
plump with high delta   resin the ziplocs had looked like bags of little teddy bear arms  the moist sounds right behind him turn
out to be a mild faced older man eating yogurt out of a plastic cup  hal keeps rechecking the meeting data in the little m b r o 
booklet the girl had given him  he notes that the booklet has broad chocolate thumb prints on several of the pages  and that two
pages are stuck firmly together with what hal fears is an ancient dried booger  and now that the booklet s cover is dated january in
the year of dairy products from the american heartland  i e  nearly two years past  and that it s not impossible that the blandly
hostile toothless girl at the ennet facility had kertwanged him by giving him a dated and useless m b r o  guide 
kevin bain keeps repeating  please  mommy and daddy  come love me and hold me  in a kind of monotone of pathos  the
gradually intensifying lisp in please is apparently a performative invocation of the old inner infant  tears and other fluids flow
and roll  the warm round leader harv s own eyes are a moist glassy blue  the cd scanner s cello is now into some sort of semijazzy pizzicato stuff that seems oxymoronic against the room s mood  hal keeps catching whiffs of a hot sick sweet civety smell
that signifies somebody nearby has some athlete s foot issues to confront  under his socks  plus it s mystifying that   a has no
windows  given all the smoky brown fenestra tion hal d seen from outside the q r s  cube  the man eating yogurt s beard is one
of those small rectangular ones that s easy to keep clear of the cup s rim  the back and side of kevin bain s hair has separated into
spiky sweat soaked strands  from the room s heat and the infant s emotions 
all through his own infancy and toddlerhood  hal had continually been held and dandled and told at high volume that he was
loved  and he feels like he could have told k  bain s inner infant that getting held and told you were loved didn t automatically
seem like it rendered you emotionally whole or substance free  hal finds he rather envies a man who feels he has something to
explain his being fucked up  parents to blame it on  not even pemulis blamed his late father mr  pemulis  who hadn t exactly
sounded like the fred macmurray of u s  fathers  but then pemulis didn t consider himself fucked up or unfree w r t substances 
the blond and buddhic cable knit harv  dandling his bear on his knee now  calmly asks kevin bain if it feels to his inner
infant like mommy and daddy were ever going to appear cribside to meet his needs 
 no   kevin says very quietly   no  it doesn t  harv  
the leader is idly arranging his bear s splayed arms in different positions  so it looks like the bear s either waving or
surrendering   do you suppose you would be able to ask someone in the group here tonight to love and hold you instead  kevin  
the back of kevin bain s head doesn t move  hal s whole digestive tract spasms at the prospect of watching two bearded
adult males in sweaters and socks engage in surrogate infant hugging  he begins asking himself why he doesn t just fake a
hideous coughing fit and flee q r s    a with his fist over his face 
harv s now waggling the bear s arms back and forth and making his voice high and cartoon characterish and pretending to
have his bear ask kevin bain s bear if it would maybe point to the man in the group kevin bain would most like to have hold and
nurture and love him in loco parentis  hal s spitting quietly down the side of his glass and brooding wretchedly at the fact that he s
driven fifty supperless clicks to listen to a globular man in plaid socks pretend his teddy bear s speaking latin when he looks up

 from the glass and is chilled to see that kevin bain has wiggled his indian style way around in his chair and is holding his bear
way up by its underarms  just the way a father holds a toddler up for a public spect op or parade  turning the throttled looking bear
this way and that  scanning the room   as hal covers part of his face with a hand  pretending to scratch an eyebrow  praying not
to be recognized   and finally manipulating the bear s arm so the plump brown fuzzy fingerless hand of the bear s pointing right
in hal s direction  hal doubles over in a coughing spasm only half faked  running decision trees on various ruses for flight 
just like his younger brother marlon bain  kevin bain is a short thick person with a dark swart face  he looks sort of like an
overdeveloped troll  and he has the same capacity for constant incredible sweating that always made marlon bain look to hal 
both on court and off   like a toad hunched moist and unblinking in humid shade  except kevin bain s little glittery bain eyes are
also red and swollen with public weeping  and he s balding back from the temples in a way that gives him a widow s peak like
nobody s business  and doesn t seem to recognize a post pubescent hal  and is pointing his bear s blunt hand hal realizes finally
after almost swallowing his plug of kodiak not at hal but at the mild faced square bearded older guy behind him  who s holding a
spoon of vividly pink yogurt in front of his bear s open mouth  just touching its protruding tongue s red corduroy  pretending to be
feeding the bear  hal very casually puts the nasa glass between his legs and gets both hands under his chair seat and hops the
chair bit by bit over and out of the lines of sight and transit between kevin bain and the yogurt man  harv  up front  is making a
complex hand signal to the yogurt man not to speak or move from his back row orange chair no matter what  and then  as kevin
bain wriggles cross legged back around to face front again  harv smoothly turns the hand signal into a motion like he s smoothing
his hair  the motion then becomes sincere and ruminative as the leader breathes deeply a couple of times  the music s settled back
into its original nodding narcosis 
 kevin   harv says   since this is a group exercise in passivity and inner infant needs  and since you ve selected jim as the
member of the group you need something from  we need you to ask jim out loud to meet your needs  ask him to come up and
hold you and love you  since your parents aren t ever coming  not ever  kevin  
kevin bain makes a mortified sound and reclamps a hand over his big swart face 
 go for it  kev   somebody over near the bly poster calls out 
 we affirm and support you   says the guy by the filing cabinet 
hal now starts scrolling through an alphabetical list of the faraway places he d rather be right now  he s not even up to addis
ababa when kevin bain acquiesces and begins very softly and hesitantly asking the mild faced jim  who s put aside his yogurt
but not the bear  to please come up and love him and hold him  by the time hal s envisioned himself tumbling over american
falls at the concavity s southwest rim in a rusty old noxious waste displacement drum  kevin bain has asked jim eleven progressively louder times to come nurture and hold him  to no avail  the older guy just sits there  clutching his yogurt tongued bear 
his expression somewhere between mild and blank 
hal has never actually seen projectile weeping before  bain s tears are actually exiting his eyes and projecting outward
several cm  before starting to fall  his facial expression is the scrunched spread one of a small child s total woe  his neck cords
standing out and face darkening so that it looks like some sort of huge catcher s mitt  a bright cape of mucus hangs from his upper
lip  and his lower lip seems to be having some kind of epileptic fit  hal finds the tantrum s expression on an adult face sort of
compelling  at a certain point hysterical grief becomes facially indistinguishable from hysterical mirth  it appears  hal imagines
watching bain weep on a white beach through binoculars from the balcony of a cool dim aruban hotel room 
 he s not coming   kevin bain finally keens to the leader 
harv the leader nods  scratching an eyebrow  and confirms that that seems to be the case  he pretends to stroke his imperial in
puzzlement and asks rhetorically what might be the problem  why mild faced jim isn t automatically coming when called 
kevin bain s just about vivisecting his poor bear out of mortified frustration  he seems deeply into his infant persona now 
and hal rather hopes these guys have procedures for getting bain at least back to sixteen before he has to try to drive home  at
some point a timpani has gotten involved in the cd s music  and a rather saucy cornet  and the music s finally started moving a
little  toward what s either a climax or the end of the disk 
by now various men in the group have started crying out to kevin bain that his inner infant wasn t getting its needs met  that
sitting there passively asking for nurture to get up and come to him wasn t getting the needs met  that kevin owed it to his inner
infant to come up with some sort of active way to meet the infant s needs  somebody shouted out  honor that infant   somebody
else called  meet those needs   hal is mentally strolling down the appian way in bright eurosunlight  eating a cannoli  twirling his
dunlop racquets by the throats like six shooters  enjoying the sunshine and cranial silence and a normal salivary flow 
pretty soon the men s supportive exhortations have distilled into everybody in the room except harv  jim and hal chanting
 meet those needs  meet those needs   in the same male crowd exhortative meter as  hold that line   or  block that kick  
kevin bain wipes his nose on his sleeve and asks humongous harv the leader what he s supposed to do to get his infant s
needs met if the person he s chosen to meet those needs won t come 
the leader has folded his hands over his belly and sat back  by this time  smiling  cross legged  holding his tongue  his bear
sits atop the protrusion of belly with its little blunt legs straight out  the way you ll see a bear sitting on a shelf  it seems to hal that
the o  in   a is now getting used up at a ferocious clip  not at all like the cool  sheep scented breezes of ascension island in the
south atlantic  the men in the room are still chanting  meet those needs  
 what you re saying is i need to actively go over to jim myself and ask him to hold me   kevin bain says  grinding at his eyes
with his knuckles 
the leader smiles blandly 
 instead of you re saying passively trying to get jim to come to me   says kevin bain  whose tears have largely stopped  and
whose sweat has taken on the clammy shine of true fear sweat 
harv emerges as one of these people who can heft one eyebrow and not the other   it would take real courage and love and
commitment to your inner infant to take the risk and go actively over to somebody that might give you what your infant needs   he
says quietly  the cd player has at some point shifted into an all cello instrumental of  i don t know  how to love him   from an
old opera lyle sometimes borrowed people s players and listened to at night in the weight room  lyle and marlon bain had been
particularly tight  hal recalls 

 the trimeter of the men s chant has reduced to a one foot low volume  needs  needs  needs  needs  needs  as kevin bain
slowly and hesitantly uncrosses his legs and rises from his orange chair  turning to face hal and the motionless guy behind him 
this jim  bain begins to move slowly toward them with the tortured steps of a mime miming walking against a tornadic gale  hal s
picturing himself doing a lazy backstroke in the azores  spouting glassy water up out of his mouth in a cytological plume  he s
leaning almost out of his chair  as far as possible out of kevin bain s line of transit  studying the brown suspension in the bottom
of his glass  his prayer not to be recognized by a regressive kevin bain is the first really desperate and sincere prayer hal can
remember offering since he d stopped wearing pajamas with feet in them 
 kevin   harv calls softly from the front of the room   is it you moving actively toward jim  or should it be the infant inside
you  the one with the needs  
 needs  needs  needs   the bearded men are chanting  some rhythmically raising their manicured fists in the air 
bain s looking back and forth between harv and jim  chewing his finger indecisively 
 is this how an infant moves towards its needs  kevin   harv says 
 go for it  kevin   a full bearded man calls out 
 let the infant out  
 let your infant do the walking  kev  
so hal s most vivid full color memory of the non anti substance meeting he drove fifty oversalivated clicks to by mistake
will become that of his older brother s doubles partner s older brother down on all fours on a dacronyl rug  crawling  hampered
because one arm was holding his bear to his chest  so he sort of dipped and rose as he crawled on three limbs toward hal and the
needs meeter behind him  bain s knees leaving twin pale tracks in the carpet and his head up on a wobbly neck and looking up and
past hal  his face unspeakable 

the ceiling was breathing  it bulged and receded  it swelled and settled  the room was in st  elizabeth s hospital s trauma
wing  whenever he looked at it  the ceiling bulged and then deflated  shiny as a lung  when don was a massive toddler his
mother had put them in a little beach house just back of the dunes off a public beach in beverly  the place was affordable because
it had a big ragged hole in the roof  origin of hole unknown  gately s outsized crib had been in the beach house s little living
room  right under the hole  the guy that owned the little cottages off the dunes had stapled thick clear polyurethane sheeting
across the room s ceiling  it was an attempt to deal with the hole  the polyurethane bulged and settled in the north shore wind and
seemed like some monstrous vacuole inhaling and exhaling directly over little gately  lying there  wide eyed  the breathing
polyurethane vacuole had seemed like it developed a character and personality as winter deepened and the winds grew worse 
gately  age like four  had regarded the vacuole as a living thing  and had named it herman  and had been afraid of it  he couldn t
feel the right side of his upper body  he couldn t move in any real sense of the word  the hospital room had that misty quality
rooms in fevers have  gately lay on his back  ghostish figures materialized at the peripheries of his vision and hung around and
then de materialized  the ceiling bulged and receded  gately s own breath hurt his throat  his throat felt somehow raped  the
blurred figure in the next bed sat up very still in bed in a sitting position and seemed to have a box on its head  gately kept having
a terrible repetitious ethnocentric dream that he was robbing the house of an oriental and had the guy tied to a chair and was
trying to blindfold him with quality mailing twine from the drawer under the oriental s kitchen phone  the oriental kept being
able to see around the twine and kept looking steadily at gately and blinking inscrutably  plus the oriental had no nose or mouth 
just a smooth expanse of lower facial skin  and wore a silk robe and scary sandals  and had no hair on its legs 
what gately perceived as light cycles and events all out of normal sequence was really gately going in and out of
consciousness  gately did not perceive this  it seemed to him more like he kept coming up for air and then being pushed below the
surface of something  once when gately came up for air he found that resident tiny ewell was seated in a chair right up next to
the bed  tiny s little slim hand was on the bed s crib type railing  and his chin rested on the hand  so his face was right up close 
the ceiling bulged and receded  the room s only light was what spilled in from the nighttime hall  nurses glided down the hall
and past the door in subsonic footwear  a tall and slumped ghostish figure appeared to gately s left  off past the blurred seated
square head boy s bed  slumped and fluttering  appearing to rest its tailbone on the sill of the dark window  the ceiling rounded on
down and then settled back flat  gately rolled his eyes up at ewell  ewell had shaved off his blunt white goatee  his hair was so
completely clean and white it took a faint pink cast from the pink of his scalp below  ewell had been discoursing to him for an
unknown length of time  it was gately s first full night in st  elizabeth s hospital s trauma wing  he didn t know what night of
the week it was  his circadian rhythm was the least of the personal rhythms that had been scrambled  his right side felt encased in
a kind of hot cement  also a sick throb in what he assumed was a toe  he wondered dimly about going to the bathroom  if and
when  ewell was right in the middle of speaking  gately couldn t tell if ewell was whispering  nurses glided across the doorway s
light  their sneakers were so noiseless the nurses seemed to be on wheels  a stolid shadow of somebody in a hat was cast
obliquely across the hall s tile floor just outside the room  as if a stolid figure were seated just outside the door  against the wall  in
a hat 
 my wife s personal term for soul is personality  as in  there s something incorrigibly dark in your personality  eldred ewell 
and dewars brings it out    
the hall floor was pretty definitely white tile  with a cloudy overwaxed shine in the bright fluorescence out there  some kind
of red or pink stripe ran down the center of the hall  gately couldn t tell if tiny ewell thought he was awake or unconscious or
what 
 it was in the fall term of third grade as a child that i found myself fallen in with the bad element  they were a group of tough
blue collar irish lads bussed in from the east watertown projects  runny noses  home cut hair  frayed cuffs  quick with their fists 
sports mad  fond of sneaker hockey on asphalt   ewell said   and yet  strangely  i  unable to do even one pull up in the president s
physical fitness test  quickly became the leader of the pack we all fell into  the blue collar lads all seemed to admire me for
attributes that were not clear  we formed a sort of club  our uniform was a gray skallycap  our clubhouse was the dugout of a
little league diamond that had fallen into disuse  our club was called the money stealers  club  at my suggestion we went with

 a descriptive name as opposed to euphemistic  the name was mine  the irish lads acquiesced  they viewed me as the brains of
the operation  i held them in a kind of thrall  this was due in large part to my capacity for rhetoric  even the toughest and most
brutish irish lad respects a gilded tongue  our club was formed for the express purpose of undertaking a bunko operation  we
went around to people s homes after school  ringing the doorbell and soliciting donations for project hope youth hockey  there
was no such organization  our donation receptacle was a chock full o  nuts can with project hope youth hockey
written on a strip of masking tape wrapped around the can  the lad who made the receptacle had spelled project with a g in
the first draft  i ridiculed him for the error  and the whole club pointed at him and laughed 
brutally   ewell kept staring at the crude blue jailhouse square and canted cross on gately s forearms   our only visible
credentials were kneepads and sticks we d purloined from the p e  stockroom  by my order  all were held carefully to conceal the
ppty w  wttn elem sch emblazoned down the side of every stick  one lad had a goalie mask on under his skallycap  the
rest kneepads and carefully held sticks  the kneepads were turned inside out for the same reason  i couldn t even skate  and my
mother absolutely forbade rough play on asphalt  i wore a necktie and combed my hair carefully after each solicitation  i was the
spokesperson  the mouthpiece  the bad lads called me  they were irish catholics all  watertown from east to west is catholic 
armenian  and mixed  the eastside boys all but genuflected to my gift for bullshit  i was exceptionally smooth with adults  i rang
doorbells and the lads arrayed themselves behind me on the porch  i spoke of disadvantaged youth and team spirit and fresh air
and the meaning of competition and alternatives to the after school streets  bad element  i spoke of mothers in support hose and
war injured older brothers with elaborate prostheses cheering disadvantaged lads on to victory against far better equipped teams  i
discovered that i had a gift for it  the emotional appeal of adult rhetoric  it was the first time i felt personal power  i was
unrehearsed and creative and moving  hard case homeowners who came to the door in sleeveless ts holding tallboys of beer with
stubble and expressions of minimal charity were often weeping openly by the time we left their porch  i was called a fine lad and a
good kid and a credit to me mum and da  my hair was tousled so often i had to carry a mirror and comb  the coffee can became
hard to carry back to the dugout  where we hid it behind a cin derblock bench support  we d netted over a hundred dollars by
halloween  this was a serious amount in those days  
tiny ewell and the ceiling kept receding and then looming in  bulging roundly  figures gately didn t know from adam kept
popping in and out of fluttery view in different corners of the room  the space between his bed and the other bed seemed to
distend and then contract with a slow sort of boinging motion  gately s eyes kept rolling up in his head  his upper lip mustached
with sweat   and i was revelling in the fraud of it  the discovery of the gift   ewell was saying   i was flushed with adrenaline  i
had tasted power  the verbal manipulation of human hearts  the lads called me the gilded blarneyman  soon the first order fraud
wasn t enough  i began secretly filching receipts from the club s chock full o  nuts can  embezzling  i persuaded the lads it was
too risky to keep the can in the open air dugout and took personal charge of the can  i kept the can in my bedroom and persuaded
my mother that it contained christmas connected gifts and must under no circumstances be inspected  to my underlings in the
club i claimed to be rolling the coins and depositing them in a high interest savings account i d opened for us in the name franklin
w  dixon  in fact i was buying myself fez and milky ways and mad magazines and a creeple peeple brand deluxe oven andmold set with six different colors of goo  this was in the early     s  at first i was discreet  grandiose but discreet  at first the
embezzlement was controlled  but the power had roused something dark in my personality  and the adrenaline drove it forward 
self will run riot  soon the club s coffee can was empty by each weekend s end  each week s haul went toward some uncontrolled
saturday binge of puerile consumption  i doctored up flamboyant bank statements to show the club  in the dugout  i got more
loquacious and imperious with them  none of the lads thought to question me  or the purple magic marker the bank statements
were done in  i was not dealing with intellectual titans here  i knew  they were nothing but malice and muscle  the worst of the
school s bad element  and i ruled them  thrall  they trusted me completely  and the rhetorical gift  in retrospect they probably
could not conceive of any sane third grader with glasses and a necktie trying to defraud them  given the inevitably brutal
consequences  any sane third grader  but i was no longer a sane third grader  i lived only to feed the dark thing in my personality 
which told me any consequences could be forestalled by my gift and grand personal aura 
 but then of course eventually christmas hove into view   gately tries to stop ewell and say  hove   and finds to his horror that
he can t make any sounds come out   the meaty catholic eastside bad element lads now wanted to tap their nonexistent franklin
w  dixon account to buy support hose and sleeveless ts for their swarthy blue collar families  i held them off as long as i could
with pedantic blather on interest penalties and fiscal years  irish catholic christmas is no laughing matter  though  and for the first
time their swarthy eyes began to narrow at me  things at school grew increasingly tense  one afternoon  the largest and swarthiest
of them assumed control of the can in an ugly dugout coup  it was a blow from which my authority never recovered  i began to
feel a gnawing fear  my denial broke  i realized i d gradually embezzled far more than i could ever make good  at home  i began
talking up the merits of private school curricula at the dinner table  the can s weekly take fell off sharply as holiday expenses
drained homeowners of change and patience  this bear market in giving was attributed by some of the club s swarthier lads to my
deficiencies  the whole club began muttering in the dugout  i began to learn that one could perspire heavily even in a bitterly cold
open air dugout  then  on the first day of advent  the lad now in charge of the can produced childish looking figures and
announced the whole club wanted their share of the accrued booty in the dixon account  i bought time with vague allusions to cosignatures and a misplaced passbook  i arrived home with chattering teeth and bloodless lips and was forced by my mother to
swallow fish oil  i was consumed with puerile fear  i felt small and weak and evil and consumed by dread of my embezzlement s
exposure  not to mention the brutal consequences  i claimed intestinal distress and stayed home from school  the telephone began
ringing in the middle of the night  i could hear my father saying  hello  hello   i did not sleep  my personality s dark part had
grown leathery wings and a beak and turned on me  there were still several days until christmas vacation  i d lie in bed panicked
during school hours amid piles of ill gotten mad magazines and creeple peeple figures and listen to the lonely handheld bells of
the salvation army santas on the street below and think of synonyms for dread and doom  i began to know shame  and to know it
as grandiosity s aide de camp  my unspecific digestive illness wore on  and teachers sent cards and concerned notes  on some
days the door buzzer would buzz after school hours and my mother would come upstairs and say  how sweet  eldred   that there
were swarthy and cuff frayed but clearly good hearted boys in gray skallycaps on the stoop asking after me and declaring that
they were keenly awaiting my return to school  i began to gnaw on the bathroom s soap in the morning to make a convincing case

 for staying home  my mother was alarmed at the masses of bubbles i vomited and threatened to consult a specialist  i felt myself
moving closer and closer to some cliff edge at which everything would come out  i longed to be able to lean into my mother s
arms and weep and confess all  i could not  for the shame  three or four of the money stealers  club s harder cases took up
afternoon positions by the nativity scene in the churchyard across from our house and stared stonily up at my bedroom window 
pounding their fists in their palms  i began to understand what a belfast protestant must feel  but even more prospectively
dreadful than pummell ings from irish catholics was the prospect of my parents  finding out my personality had a dark thing that
had driven me to grandiose wickedness and left me there  
gately has no idea how ewell feels about him making no responses  whether ewell doesn t like it or even notices it or what 
he can breathe ok  but something in his raped throat won t let whatever s supposed to vibrate to speak vibrate 
 finally  on the day before my gastroenterologist appointment  when my mother was down the street at a speculum party  i
crept downstairs from my sick bed and stole over a hundred dollars from a shoebox marked i b e w  local     petty
slush in the back of my father s den s closet  i d never dreamed of resorting to the shoebox before  stealing from my own
parents  to remit funds i d stolen from dull witted boys with whom i d stolen them from adults i d lied to  my feelings of fear and
despicability only increased  i now felt ill for real  i lived and moved in the shadow of something dark that hovered just overhead 
i vomited without aid of emetic  now  but secretly  so i could return to school  i couldn t face the prospect of a whole christmas
vacation of swarthy sentries pounding their palms outside the house  i converted my father s union s bills to small change and paid
off the money stealers  club and got pummelled anyway  apparently on general bad element principles  i discovered the latent
rage in followers  the fate of the leader who falls from the mob s esteem  i was pummelled and given a savage wedgie and hung
from a hook in my school locker  where i remained for several hours  swollen and mortified  and going home was worse  home
was no refuge  for home was the scene of the third order crime  of theft cubed  i couldn t sleep  i tossed and turned  there were
night terrors  i was unable to eat  no matter how long after supper i had to stay at the table  the more worried about me my parents
became  the greater my shame  i felt a shame and personal despicability no third grader should have to feel  the holidays were not
jolly  i looked back over the autumn and failed to recognize anyone named eldred k  ewell jr  it no longer seemed a question of
insanity or dark parts of me  i had stolen from neighbors  slum children  and family  and bought myself sweets and toys  under
any tenable definition of bad  i was bad  i resolved to toe the virtuous line from then on  the shame and horror was too awful  i
had to remake myself  i resolved to do whatever was required to see myself as good  remade  i never knowingly committed another felony  the whole shameful interval of the money stealers  club was moved to mental storage and buried there  don  i d
forgotten it ever happened  until the other night  don  the other night  after the fracas and your display of reluctant se
offendendo        after your injury and the whole aftermath     don  i dreamed the whole mad repressed third grade interval of
grandiose perfidy all over again  vividly and completely  when i awoke  i was somehow minus my goatee and my hair was
center parted in a fashion i haven t favored for forty years  the bed was soaked  and there was a gnawed looking cake of
mcdade s special anti acne soap in my hand  
gately starts to short term recall that he was offered i v  demerol for the pain of his gunshot wound immediately on
admission to the e r  and has been offered demerol twice by shift drs  who haven t bothered to read the history of
narcotics dependency no schedule c iv  medic  that gately d made pat montesian swear she d make them put in
italics on his file or chart or whatever  first thing  last night s emergency surgery was remedial  not extractive  because the big
pistol s ordnance had apparently fragmented on impacting and passed through the meters of muscle that surrounded gately s
humorous ball and scalpula socket  passing through and missing bone but doing great and various damage to soft tissues  the
e r  s trauma specialist had prescribed toradol im       but had warned that the pain after the surgery s general anesthetic
wore off was going to be unlike anything gately had ever imagined  the next thing gately knew he was upstairs in a trauma
wing room that trembled with sunlight and a different dr  was speculating to either pat m  or calvin t  that the invasive foreign
body had been treated with something unclean  beforehand  possibly  because gately s developed a massive infection  and they re
monitoring him for something he heard as noxzema but is really toxemia  gately also wanted to protest that his body was     
american  but he seemed temporarily unable to vocalize aloud  later it was nighttime and ewell was there  intoning  it was totally
unclear what ewell wanted from gately or why he was choosing this particular time to share  gately s right shoulder was almost
the same size as his head  and he had to roll his eyes up and over like a cow to see ewell s hand on the railing and his face floating
above it 
 and how will i administer the ninth step when it comes time to make amends  how can i start to make reparations  even if
i could remember the homes of the citizens we defrauded  how many could still be there  living  the club lads have doubtless
scattered into various low rent districts and dead end careers  my father lost the i b e w        account under the weld
administration and has been dead since       and the revelations would kill my mother  my mother is very frail  she uses a
walker  and arthritis has twisted her head nearly all the way around on her neck  my wife jealously protects my mother from all
unpleasant facts regarding me  she says someone has to do it  my mother believes right this minute i m at a nine month banquede geneve sponsored tax law symposium in the alsace  she keeps sending me knitted skiwear that doesn t fit  from the rest home 
 don  this buried interval and the impost i ve carried ever since may have informed my whole life  why i was drawn to tax
law  helping wealthy suburbanites two step around their fair share  my marriage to a woman who looks at me as if i were a dark
stain at the back of her child s trousers  my whole descent into somewhat heavier than normal drinking may have been some
instinctive attempt to bury third grade feelings of despicability  submerge them in an amber sea 
 i don t know what to do   ewell said 
gately was on enough toradol im to make his ears ring  plus a saline drip with doryx       
 i don t want to remember despicabilities i can do nothing about  if this is a sample of the  more will be revealed   i hereby
lodge a complaint  some things seem better left submerged  no  
and everything on his right side was on fire  the pain was getting to be emergency type pain  like scream and yank yourcharred hand off the stove type pain  parts of him kept sending up emergency flares to other parts of him  and he could neither
move nor call out 
 i m scared   from what seemed somewhere overhead and rising  was the last thing gately heard ewell whisper as the ceiling

 bulged down toward them  gately wanted to tell tiny ewell that he could totally fucking i d  with ewell s feelings  and that if he 
tiny  could just hang in and tote that bale and put one little well shined shoe in front of the other everything would end up all
right  that the god of ewell s understanding would find some way for ewell to make things right  and then he could let the
despicable feelings go instead of keeping them down with dewars  but gately couldn t connect the impulse to speak with actual
speech  still  he settled for trying to reach his left hand across and pat ewell s hand on the railing  but his own breadth was too far
to reach across  and then the white ceiling came all the way down and made everything white 
he seemed to sort of sleep  he fever dreamed of dark writhing storm clouds writhing darkly and screaming on down the
beach at beverly ma  the winds increasing over his head until herman the polyurethane vacuole burst from the force  leaving a
ragged inhaling maw that tugged at gately s xxl dr  dentons  a blue stuffed brontosaurus was sucked upward out of the crib
and disappeared into the maw  spinning  his mother was getting the shit beaten out of her by a man with a shepherd s crook in the
kitchen and couldn t hear gately s frantic cries for help  he broke through the crib s bars with his head and went to the front door
and ran outside  the black clouds up the beach lowered and roiled  funnelling sand  and as gately watched he saw a tornado s
snout emerge from the clouds and slowly lower  it looked as if the clouds were either giving birth or taking a shit  gately ran
across the beach to the water to escape the tornado  he ran through the crazed breakers to deep warm water and submerged
himself and stayed under until he ran out of breath  it was now no longer clear if he was little bimmy or the grown man don  he
kept coming up briefly for a great sucking breath and then going back under where it was warm and still  the tornado stayed in
one place on the beach  bulging and receding  screaming like a jet  its opening a breathing maw  lightning coming off the funnelcloud like hair  he could hear the tiny tattered sounds of his mother calling his name  the tornado was right by the beach house
and the whole house trembled  his mother came out the front door  wild haired and holding a bloody ginsu knife  calling his
name  gately tried to call for her to come into the deep water with him  but even he couldn t hear his calls against the scream of
the storm  she dropped the knife and held her head as the funnel pointed its pointy maw her way  the beach house exploded and
his mother flew through the air toward the funnel s intake  arms and legs threshing  as if swimming in wind  she vanished into the
maw and was pulled spinning up into the tornado s vortex  shingles and boards followed her  no sign of the shepherd s crook of
the man who d hurt her  gately s right lung burned horribly  he saw his mother for the last time when lightning lit up the funnel s
cone  she was whirling around and around like something in a drain  rising  seeming to swim  bluely backlit  the burst of
lightning was the white of the sunlit room when he came up for air and opened his eyes  his mother s tiny rotating imago faded
against the ceiling  what seemed like heavy breathing was him trying to scream  the skinny bed s sheets were soaked and he
needed a piss something bad  it was daytime and his right side was in no way numb  and he was immediately nostalgic for the
warm cement feeling of when it was numb  tiny ewell was gone  his every pulse was an assault on his right side  he didn t think
he could stand it for even another second  he didn t know what would happen  but he didn t think he could stand it 
later somebody who was either joelle van d  or a st  e s nurse in a u h i d  veil was running a cold washcloth over his face 
his face was so big it took some time to cover it all  it seemed too tender a touch on the cloth for a nurse  but then gately heard
the clink of i v  bottles being changed or r n ishly messed with somewhere overhead behind him  he was unable to ask about
changing the sheets or going to the bathroom  some time after the veiled lady left  he just gave up and let the piss go  and instead
of feeling wet heat he heard the rising metallic sound of something filling up somewhere near the bed  he couldn t move to lift the
covers and see what he was hooked up to  the blinds were up  and the room was so bright white in the sunlight everything looked
bleached and boiled  the guy with either the square head or the box on his head had been taken off someplace  his bed unmade
and one crib railing down  there were no ghostish figures or figures in mist  the hallway was no brighter than the room  and
gately couldn t see any shadows of anybody in a hat  he didn t even know if last night had been real  the pain kept making his
lids flutter  he hadn t cried over pain since he was four  his last thought before letting his lids stay shut against the brutal white of
the room was that he d maybe been castrated  which was how he d always heard the term catheterized  he could smell rubbing
alcohol and a kind of vitamin stink  and himself 
at some point a probably real pat montesian came in and got her hair in his eye when she kissed his cheek and told him if he
could just hang in and concentrate on getting well everything would be fine  that everything at the house was back to normal 
more or less  and essentially fine  that she was so sorry he d had to handle a situation like that alone  without support or counsel 
and that she realized full well lenz and the canadian thugs hadn t given him enough time to call anybody  that he d done the very
best he could with what he d had to work with and had nothing to feel horrid about  to let it go  that the violence hadn t been
relapse type thrill seeking violence but simply doing the best he could at that moment and trying to stand up for himself and for a
resident of the house  pat montesian was dressed as usual entirely in black  but formally  as in for taking somebody to court  and
her formalwear looked like a mexican widow s  she really had said the words thug and horrid  she said not to worry  the house
was a community and it took care of its own  she kept asking if he was sleepy  her hair s red was a different and less radiant red
than the red of joelle van d  s hair  the left side of her face was very kind  gately had very little understanding of what she was
talking about  he was kind of surprised the finest hadn t come calling already  pat didn t know about the remorseless a d a  or
the suffocated nuck  gately d tried hard to share openly about the wreckage of his past  but some issues still seemed suicidal to
share about  pat said that gately was showing tremendous humility and willingness sticking to his resolution about nothing
stronger than non narcotic painkillers  but that she hoped he d remember that he wasn t in charge of anything except putting
himself in his higher power s hands and following the dictates of his heart  that codeine or maybe percoset       or maybe even
demerol wouldn t be a relapse unless his heart of hearts that knew his motives thought it would be  her red hair was down and
looked uncombed and mashed in on the side  she looked frazzled  gately wanted very much to ask pat about the legal fallout of
the other night s thug fracas  he realized she kept asking if he was sleepy because his attempts to speak looked like yawns  his
inability to still speak was like speechlessness in bad dreams  airless and hellish  horrid 
what made the whole interface with pat m  possibly unreal was that right at the end for no reason pat m  burst into tears  and
for no reason gately got so embarrassed he pretended to pass out  and slept again  and probably dreamed 
almost certainly dreamed and unreal was the interval when gately came up with a start and saw mrs  lopate  the objay dart
from the shed that they come and install next to the ennet house viewer some days  sitting there in a gunmetal wheelchair  face
contorted  head cocked  hair stringy  looking not at him but more like seemingly at whatever array of i v  bottles and signifying

 monitors hung above and behind his big crib  so not speaking or even looking at him but still in some sense being there with him 
somehow  even though there was no way she could have really been there  it was the first time gately realized that the catatonic
mrs  l  had been the same lady he d seen touching the tree in    s front lawn late at night  some nights  when he d first come on
staff  that they were the same person  and that this realization was real even though the lady s presence in the room was not  the
complexities of which made his eyes roll up in his head again as he passed back out again 
then at some later point joelle van dyne was sitting in a chair just outside the railing of the bed  veiled  wearing sweatpants
and a sweater that was starting to unravel  in a pink bordered veil  not saying anything  probably looking at him  probably thinking
he was unconscious with his eyes open  or delirious with noxzema  the whole right side of himself hurt so bad each breath was
like a hard decision  he wanted to cry like a small child  the girl s silence and the blankness of her veil frightened him after a
while  and he wished he could ask her to come back later 
nobody d offered him anything to eat  but he wasn t hungry  there were i v  tubes going into the backs of both hands and the
crook of his left elbow  other tubing exited him lower down  he didn t want to know  he kept trying to ask his heart if just
codeine would be a relapse  according to the heart  but his heart was declining to comment 
then at some point ennet house alum and senior counselor calvin thrust came roaring in and pulled up a chair and straddled
it backwards like a slow tease stripper  slumping and draping his arms over the back of the chair  gesturing with an unlit rodney as
he spoke  he told gately that man he looked like shit something heavy had fell on  but he told gately he should get a gander of
the other guys  the nucks in polynesian wear  thrust and the house manager had got there before e m p h h  security could
drag the finest away from issuing midnight street side citations down on comm  ave   he told gately  lenz and green and
alfonso parias carbo had dragged carried the passed out gately inside and laid him on the black vinyl couch in pat s office 
where gately had come to and told them ixnay on the ambulanceay and to please wake him up in five more minutes  and then
passed out for serious real  parias carbo seemed like he d suffered a mild intestinal hernia from dragging carrying gately  but he
was being a man about it and had refused codeine downstairs at the e r  and was expressing gratitude for the growth experience 
and the thoraxic lump was receding nicely  calvin thrust s breath smelled of smoke and old scrambled eggs  gately had once seen
a cheap bootleg cartridge of a young calvin thrust having sex with a lady with only one arm on what looked like a crude
homemade trapeze  the cartridge s lighting and production values had been real low quality  and gately had been in and out of a
demerol nod  but he was     sure it had been the young calvin thrust  calvin thrust said how right there over gately s
unconscious form in the office randy lenz had begun womaning right off how of course he  randy lenz  was going to somehow
get blamed for gately and the nucks getting fucked up and why didn t they just get it over with and give him the administrative
shoe right now without going through the sham motions of deliberating  bruce green had rammed lenz up against pat s cabinets
and shaken him like a marga rita  but refused to rat out lenz or say why irate canadians might think a specimen as dickless as
lenz might have demapped their friend  the matter was under investigation  but thrust confessed to a certain admiration for
green s refusal to eat cheese  brucie g  had suffered a broken nose in the beef and now had a terrific set of twin shiners  calvin
thrust said both he  calvin thrust  and the house manager had immediately on arrival pegged lenz as either coked up or  drined
to the gills on some  drine  and thrust said he summoned every oreida of self control sobriety d blessed him with and had quietly
taken lenz out of the office into the special disabled bedroom next door and over the sound of burt f  smith coughing up little
pieces of lung in his sleep he said he d real controlledly given lenz the choice of voluntarily resigning his ennet residency on the
spot or submitting to a spot urine and a room search and everything like that  plus to questioning by the finest  who were pretty
doubtless even now on route with the fleet of ambulances for the nucks  meanwhile  thrust said   gesturing with the gasper and
occasionally leaning forward to see whether gately was still conscious and to tell him he looked like shit  meanwhile   gately
had been lying there passed out  wedged with two full filing cabinets to keep him from rolling off the couch he was wider than 
and was bleeding in a very big way  and nobody knew how to  like  affix a turnipcut to a shoulder  and the good bodied new girl
with the cloth mask was bending over the arm of the couch applying pressure to towels on gately s bleeding  and her partly open
robe was yielding a view that even brought alfonso p  c  around from his herniated fetal posture on the floor  and thrust and the
house manager were taking turns asking for help to intuitively know what they ought to do with gately  because it was well
known that he was on probie against a real serious bit  and with all due trust and respect to don it wasn t clear at that point from
the scattered damaged canadian forms still in different prone positions out in the street who d done what to who in defense of
whatever or not  and the finest tend to take a keen interest in huge guys who come into e r  s with spectacular gunshot wounds 
and but then when pat m  pulled up in the aventura laying rubber a couple minutes later she d screamed rather unserenely at
thrust for not having already rikky ticked don gately over to st  e  s on his own already  thrust said he d let go of pat s
screaming like water off a duck  revealing that pat m  had been under felony weight domestic stress at home  he knew  he said
and but so gately was too heavy to carry unconscious for more than a few meters  even with the masked girl filling in for pariascarbo  and they d just barely got gately outside still in his wet bowling shirt and laid him briefly on the sidewalk and covered him
with pat s black suede car coat while thrust maneuvered his beloved corvette up as close to gately as possible  the sounds of
sirens on the way up comm  ave  mixed with the sounds of severely fucked up canadians returning to whatever passed with
nucks for consciousness and calling for what they called medecins  and with the crazed squirrel sound of lenz trying to start his
rusted out brown duster  which had a bad solenoid  they d heaved gately s dead weight in the  vette and pat m  drove interference like a madwoman in her turbocharged aventura  pat let the masked girl ride shotgun with her because the masked girl
wouldn t quit asking her to let her come too  the house manager stayed behind to represent ennet house to e m p h h  security
and the somewhat less bullshittable bpd finest  the sirens got steadily closer  which added to the confusion because senile and
mobile vegetable residents of both unit    and the shed had been drawn out on the frozen lawns by the freakas  and the mix of
several kinds of sirens didn t do them a bit of good  and they started flapping and shrieking and running around and adding to the
medical confusion of the whole scene  which by the time him and pat pulled out of there was a fucking millhouse and everything
like that  thrust asks rhetorically how much does don fucking weigh  anyway  because moving the front buckets way up to where
like dwarfs put them and putting gately s carcass across the back seat of the  vette had required all available hands and even burt
f s  s stumps  had been like trying to get something humongous through a door that s way smaller than the humongous thing was
and everything like that  thrust occasionally tapped his gasper like he thought it was lit  the first squad cars had come fishtailing

 around the warren comm  corner just as they all came out of the e m  driveway onto warren  pat in her car up ahead had made
an arm motion that could have been either waving coolly at the passing finest or uncoolly clutching her head  thrust said had he
mentioned gately s blood  gately d bled all over pat m  s vinyl couch and filing cabinets and carpet  the little e m  streetlet  the
sidewalk  pat m  s black suede car coat  pretty much everybody s winter coats  and the beloved upholstery of thrust s beloved
corvette  which upholstery thrust might add had been new  and dear  but he said not to worry about it  thrust said  the fucking
blood was the least of the problems  gately didn t like the sound of that at all  and started trying to blink at him in a kind of crude
code  to get his attention  but thrust either didn t notice it or thought it was like a postoperative tic  thrust s hair was always
combed straight back like a mobster  thrust said at the st  e  s e r  how the e r  crew had been quick and ingenious about getting
gately out of the  vette and onto a double width gur ney  though they did have some trouble lifting the gurney so they could get
the legs with wheels set up under it so the guys in white could roll him in with more guys in white walking briskly alongside of
him and leaning over him and applying pressure and barking little orders in terse code like they always do in e r s and everything
like that  in emergencies  thrust says he couldn t tell if they could tell right away it was a spectacular gunshot wound  nobody
used the g word or anything like that  thrust had babbled something about a chain saw while pat nodded furiously  the chief two
things gately kept blinking rhythmically to try to find out were  did anybody end up getting killed  meaning the nucks  and has
this one certain a d a  type figure that always wore a hat come in from essex county or given any sign of getting wind of
gately s whereabouts or involvement  and   so really three things   and will any of the ennet house residents that were right
there on the scene from start to finish look respectable enough on paper to have creditibility as like legal witnesses  plus he
wouldn t mind knowing what the fuck thrust was thinking of  scaring lenz off and letting him screw off into the urban night
leaving gately maybe holding the statutory bag  most of calvin thrust s legality experience was filmic and petty vice  thrust
eventually describes that one of the house manager s key coups of quick thinking was doing a quick tp scan and finding out
which of the residents out there milling around with the catatonics on the street had up in the air legal issues such that they
needed to be se cloistered in the protected area of the house out of legal sight by the time the bpd s finest hit the scene  he says
in his view it was lucky for gately that he  gately  was such a massive son of a bitch and had so much blood  because even so
gately d lost huge volumes of blood all over people s upholstery and was in shock and everything like that by the time they got
him on the double width gurney  his face cheese colored and his lips blue and muttering all this shock type stuff  but even so here
he  gately  was  not exactly ready for a gq cover but still sucking air  thrust said in the waiting room at the e r   where they
wouldn t let a working man smoke down there either  he said then the arrogant new girl resident in the white veil had up and tried
to take thrust s inventory for letting randy l  resign and decamp before his part in gately s legal embryoglio could be nailed
down  and pat m  had been pretty unconditionally loving about it but it was obvious she wasn t thrilled with thrust s tactics either
and everything like that  gately blinked furiously to signify his agreement with joelle s position  calvin thrust gestured stoically
with his cigarette and said he d told pat m  the truth  he always told the truth  no matter how unpleasant for himself  today  he said
he d said he d encouraged lenz to rikky tick out of there because otherwise he was afraid that he  thrust  was going to eliminate
lenz s map on the spot  out of rage  lenz s solenoid appeared to have been on the permanent dicky  because the rusty duster was
seen by new resident amy j  real early the next a m  getting towed from its wrong side of the street spot in front of    when
amy j  slunk back to the house all jonesy and hung over to get her hefty bag full of evicted personal shit  lenz apparently having
abandoned his wheels and fleen off by foot during all the finest s confusion and static with the ambulance drivers that who could
blame them didn t want to take canadians because of horrible paperwork for health card reimbursement for nucks  the house
manager had gone so far as planting herself out in front of the house s locked front door with her not all that small arms and legs
spread out  blocking the door  assertively stating at whatever finest tried to enter that ennet house was court mandated protected
by the commonwealth of ma and could only be entered with a court order and three working days  mandated time for the house
to file an injunction and wait for a ruling  and the finest and even the booger eating morons from e m p h h  security were
successfully held in bay and kept out  therefore  by her  alone  and pat m  was considering rewarding the house manager s
coolness under fire by promoting her to assistant director next month when the present assistant director left to go get certified
in jet engine maintenance at east coast aerotech on a mass rehab grant  gately s eyes keep rolling up in his head  only partly
from pain 
unless he actually had a lit gasper going  calvin thrust always has this way of being only technically wherever he was  there
was always this air of imminent departure about him  like a man whose beeper was about to sound  it s like a lit gasper was
psychic ballast for him or something  everything he said to gately seemed like it was going to be the last thing he said right
before he looked at his watch and slapped his forehead and left 
thrust said whatever that nuck that the residents allege shot him shot him with was serious ordnance  because there d been
bits of gately s shoulder and bowling shirt all over the complex s little street  thrust pointed at the huge bandage and asked
whether they d talked to gately yet about was he going to get to keep what was left of the mutilated shoulder and arm  gately
found that the only audible sound he could make sounded like a run over kitten  thrust mentioned that danielle s  d been over to
mass rehab with burt f s  and had reported how they were doing miraculous things with prosfeces these days  gately s eyes were
rolling around in his head and he was making pathetic little scared aspirated sounds as he pictured himself with a hook and parrot
and patch making piratical  arr matey  sounds from the aa podium  he felt a terrible certainty that the whole nerve assembly
network that connected the human voice box to the human mind and let somebody ask for crucial legal and medical feedback
must run through the right human shoulder  all kinds of fucking shunts and crazy interconnections with nerves  he knew  he
imagined himself with one of those solar cell electric shaver voice box prosfeces he has to hold up to his throat  maybe with his
hook   trying to carry the message with it from the podium  sounding like an automatic teller or rom audio interface  gately
wanted to know what day the next day was and whether any of lenz s nucks had been demapped  and what the official capacity
of the guy was in the hat who d been sitting just outside the door to the room either last night or the night before  his hat s shadow
cast in a kind of parallelogram across the open doorway  and if the guy was still there  assuming the sight of the guy s hatted
shadow had been valid and not phantasmic  and he wondered how they went about cuffing you if one of your arms  shoulders was
mutilated and the size of your head  if gately took anything deeper than a half breath  a mind bending sheet of pain goes down his
right side  he even breathed like a sick kitten  more like throbbing than breathing  thrust said hester thrale had apparently

 disappeared sometime during the freakas and never came back  gately could remember her running screaming off into the urban
night  thrust said her alfa romeo got towed the next a m  right along with lenz s bum duster  and her stuff s been duly bagged
and is on the porch and everything familiar like that  thrust said they found this mysteriously huge stash of high quality irish
luggage during the staff s search of lenz s room  and the house looks to be fixed for trash  and eviction bags for the next fiscal
year  discharged residents  bagged possessions stay on the porch for three days  and gately s trying to calculate the present date
from this fact  thrust says emil minty got a full house restriction for getting observed removing one of hester thrale s
undergarments from her bag on the porch  for reasons nobody much wants to speculate about  kate gom pert and ruth van cleve
supposedly went to hit an na meeting in inman square and got supposedly mugged and separated  and then only ruth van cleve
showed up back at the house  and pat s sworn out a p c  warrant for gompert because of the girl s other psych and suicide issues 
gately discovers he doesn t even all that much care whether anybody thought to call stavros l  at the shattuck about gately s day
job  thrust smoothed his hair back and said what else let s see  johnette foltz is so far covering gately s shifts and said to say he s
in her prayers  chandler foss finished out his nine months and graduated but came back the next morning and hung around for
morning meditation  which has to be a good sign sobriety wise for the old chandulator  jennifer belbin did get indicted on the
bad check issue up in wellfleet circuit court  but they re going to let her finish out her residency at the house before anything
goes to trial  which her p d  said graduating the house is guaranteed to get her bit cut in at least half  the asst  director had gone
up to court with belbin on her own time  doony glynn s still laid up with the diveritis thing  and can be neither coaxed nor threatened out of his fetal position in bed  and the house manager s trying to breastwork through the red tape at health to get them to
ok him admission to st  e  s even though he s got insurance fraud on his yellow sheet  part of his own past wreckage  a guy that
had gone through the house back when thrust did and had stayed sober in aa for four solid years had suddenly out of nowhere
slipped up and took the first drink the same day as the lenz freakas  and predictably ended getting totally shitfaced  and went
and fell off the end of the fort point pier   like literally took a long walk on a short pier  apparently   and sank like a rock  and
the memorial service is today  which is why thrust is going to have to take off in a second here  he says  the new kid tingley s
coming out of the linen closet for up to an hour at a time and is taking solid food and johnette s quit lobbying to have the kid sent
over to met state  the even newer new guy now that s come in to take chandler foss s spot s name is dave k  and is one grim
story to behold  thrust assures him  a junior executive guy at athscme air displacement  an upscale guy with a picket house
and kids and a worried wife with tall hair  who this dave k  s bottom was he drank half a liter of cuerva at some athscme
interdependence day office party and everything like that and got in some insane drunken limbo dance challenge with a rival
executive and tried to like limbo under a desk or a chair or something insanely low  and got his spine all fucked up in a limbolock  maybe permanently  so the newest new guy scuttles around the ennet house living room like a crab  his scalp brushing the
floor and his knees trembling with effort  danielle s 
thinks burt f s  might have batorial ammonia or some kind of chronic lung thing  and geoff d  s trying to get the other
residents to sign a petition to get burt barred from the kitchen and dining room because burt can t cover his mouth when he
coughs  understandably  thrust says clenette h  and yolanda w  are taking meals in their room and are under orders not to come
down or go near any windows  because of what happened to the map of the nuck they allegedly stomped and everything like that 
gately mews and blinks like mad  thrust says everybody s being real supportive of jenny b  and encouraging her to turn the
wellfleet indictment over to her higher power  the shed staff are still rolling the catatonic lady s wheelchair over from the shed
to the house on scheduled a m  s  and thrust says johnette had to write up minty and diehl for putting one of those gag arrows
that are curved in the middle and look like there s an arrow through your head over the catatonic lady s paralyzed head yesterday
and leaving her slumped by the tp like that all day  plus thrale s panties  so suddenly in twelve hours minty s just one more
offense away from getting the shoe  which thrust is already personally shining the tip of his very sharpest shoe  in hopes  the
biggest issue at the house bitch and complaint meeting was that earlier this week it turns out clenette h  had brung in this whole
humongous shitload of cartridges she said they were getting ready to throw in the dumpster up at the swank tennis school up the
hill she works at  and she promoted them and hauled them down to the house  and the residents all have a wild hair because pat
says staff has to preview the cartridges for suitability and sex before they can be put out for the residents  and the residents are all
bitching that this ll take forever and it s just the fucking staff hoarding the new entertainment when the house s tp s just about on
its hands and knees in the entertainment desert starving for new entertainment  mcdade bitched at the meeting that if he had to
watch nightmare on elm street xxii  the senescence one more time he was going to take a brody off the house s roof 
plus thrust says bruce green hasn t shared word one to staff about his feelings about anything to do with lenz or gately s
embryoglio  that he just sits around waiting for somebody to read his mind  that his roommates have complained that he thrashes
and shouts about nuts and cigars in his sleep 
calvin thrust  four years sober  straddling the backwards chair  keeps inclining himself ever more forward in the posture of a
man who s at any moment going to push up off out of the chair and leave  he reports how something deep in the previously
hopelessly arrogant seeming  tiny  ewell seems like it s broken and melted  spiritually speaking  the guy shaved off his kentucky
chicken beard  was heard weeping in the   man head  and was observed by johnette taking out the kitchen trash in secret even
though his chore this week was office windows  thrust had discovered fine dining in sobriety  and has the beginning of chins 
his hair is slicked back with odorless stuff at all times  and he has a more or less permanent sore on his upper lip  gately for some
reason keeps imagining joelle van dyne dressed as madame psychosis sitting in a plain chair in the   woman room eating a
peach and looking out the open window at the crucifix atop st  elizabeth s hospital s prolix roof  the crucifix isn t big  but it s up
so high it s visible from most anywhere in enfield brighton  sees joelle delicately pulling the veil out to get the peach up under it 
thrust says charlotte treat s t cell count is down  she s needlepointing gately some kind of get better a day at a time
assuming that s god s will doily  but it s been slow going  because treat s developed some kind of goopy virus related
eye infection that s got her bumping into walls  and her counselor maureen n  at the staff meeting wanted pat to consider having
her transferred to an hiv halfway house up in everett that s got some recovering addicts in there  morris hanley  speaking of tcells  has baked some cream cheese brownies for gately as a nurturing gesture  but then the twats at the trauma wing s nurses 
station  like  impounded them from thrust when he came up  but he d had a couple on the way over in the bloodstained  vette and
he could assure don that hanley s brownies were worth killing a loved one for and everything like that  gately feels a sudden rush

 of anxiety over the issue of who s cooking the house supper in his absence  like will they know to put corn flakes in the meat loaf 
for texture  he finds thrust insufferable and wishes he d just fucking go already  but has to admit he s less conscious of the
horrific pain when somebody s there  but that that s mostly because the drowned panic of not being able to ask questions or have
any input into what somebody s saying is so awful it sort of dwarfs the pain  thrust puts his unlit gasper behind his ear where
gately predicts hair tonic will render it unsmokable  looks conspiratorially around back over each shoulder  leans in so his face is
visible between two bars of the bed s side railing  and bathes gately s face in old eggs and smoke as he leans in and quietly says
that gately ll be psyched to hear that all the residents that were at the embryoglio   except lenz and thrale and the ones that
aren t in a legal position to step forward and like that  he says   he says they ve most of them all come forward and filed
depositions  that the bpd s finest  plus some rather weirder federal guys with goofy looking archaic crew cuts  probably involved
because of the like inter o n a n  element of the nucks   here gately s big heart skips and sinks   have come around and been
voluntarily admitted inside  on pat s written ok  and they took depositions  which is like testifying on paper  and the depositions
look to be basically      behind don gately and support a justifiable senorio of either self defense or lenz defense  several
testimonies indicate the nucks gave the impression of being under the influence of aggressive type substances  the single biggest
problem right now  thrust says pat says  is the missing alleged item  as in the     item gately was plugged with s whereabouts
are missing  thrust says  the last resident to depose to seeing it was green  who says he took it away from the nuck the nigger
girls stomped  whereupon he  green  says he dropped it on the lawn  whereupon it liked vanished from legal view  thrust says
that in his legal view the item s the thing that makes the difference between a senorio of ironshod self defense and one of just
maybe a huge fucking beef in which gately got mysteriously plugged at some indefinite point while rearranging a couple
canadian maps with his huge bare hands  gately s heart is now somewhere around his bare hairy shins  at the mention of federal
crewcuts  his attempted plea for thrust to come out and say did he actually kill anybody did he sounds like that crushed kitten
again  the pain of the terror is past standing  and it helps him surrender and quit trying  and he relaxes his legs and decides thrust
gets to not say whatever he wants  that the reality right this second is that he s mute and powerless over thrust  thrust leans in and
hugs the back of the chair and says clenette henderson and yolanda willis are on full house restriction in their room to keep
them from coming down and maybe fucking themselves over legally in a deposition  because the nuck with the plaid hat with the
ear flaps and the missing alleged item had expired on the spot from a spike heel through the right eye  as he was getting the shit
stomped out of him as only female niggers can stomp  and everything like that  and yolanda willis had very shrewdly left the
shoe and spike heel right there protruding from the guy s map with her toe prints all over its insides   meaning presumably the
shoe s   so producing the item was going to be in her strong legal interests too  as well  as thrust analyzes the legal landscape 
thrust says pat s limped around and appealed to every single resident personally  and everybody s submitted more or less voluntarily to a room  and property search and everything like that  and still no large caliber item has turned up  though nell gunther s
hidden oriental knife collection sure made an impression  thrust predicts it ll be strongly in gately s lego judicial interest and
everything like that to ransack his brain and mind for where and with who he last saw the alleged gun  the sun was starting to go
down over the west newton hills through the double sealed windows  now  trembling slightly  and the windowlight against the
far wall was ruddled and bloody  the heater vents kept making a sound like a distant parent gently shushing  when it starts to get
dark out is when the ceiling breathes  and everything like that 
sometime later  at night  backlit by the light of the hall  is the figure of resident geoffrey day  sitting where thrust had sat
but with the chair turned around the right way and with his legs primly crossed  eating a cream cheese brownie he reports they re
passing out free to people down at the nurses  station  day says johnette f  is certainly no don gately in the culinary arena  she
seems to enjoy some sort of collusive kickback type relationship with the manufacturers of spam  day says  is his theory  it might
be a whole different night  the nighttime ceiling no longer bulges convexly with gately s own shallow breaths  and the improved
sounds he can now make have evolved from feline to more like bovine  but his right side hurts so bad he can barely hear  it s gone
from a fiery pain to cold dead deep tight pain with a queer flavor of emotional loss to it  from deep inside he can hear the pain
laughing at the    mg  of toradol im they ve got in the i v  drip  as with ewell  when gately comes up out of sleep there s no
way to tell how long day s been there  or quite why  day is plowing through a long story it seems about his relationship growing
up with his younger brother  gately has a hard time imagining day being blood related to anybody  day says his brother was
developmentally challenged in some way  he had enormous red wet loose lips and wore eyeglasses so thick his eyes had looked
like an ant s eyes  growing up  part of his challenge was that day s brother had had a crippling phobic fear of leaves  apparently 
as in ordinary leaves  from trees  day s been sucker punched by an emergent sober memory of how he used to emotionally abuse
his little brother simply by threatening to touch him with a leaf  day has this way of holding his cheek and jaw when he talks like
cutout photos of the late j  benny  it s not at all evident why day s choosing to share this stuff with a mute and feverishly
semiconscious gately  it seems like don g  s gotten way more popular as somebody to talk to since he s become effectively
paralyzed and mute  the ceiling s behaving itself  but in the room s gray gately could still make out a tallly insubstantial ghostish
figure appearing and disappearing in the mist of his vision s periphery  there was some creepy relationship between the figure s
postures and the passing nurses  noiseless glide  this figure pretty definitely seemed to prefer night to day  though by this point
gately could well have been asleep again  as day began to describe different species of hand held leaves 
a recurring bad dream gately s had ever since he gave up and came in and got straight consists simply of a tiny acne scarred
oriental woman looking down at him  nothing else happens  she s just looking down at gately  her acne scars aren t even all that
bad  the thing is that she s tiny  she s one of those tiny little anonymous oriental women you see all over metro boston  always
seeming to be carrying multiple shopping bags  but in the recurring dream she s looking down at him  from his perspective he s
looking up and she s looking down  which means gately in the dream is either  a  lying down on his back looking vulnerably up at
her or  b  is himself even more incredibly tiny than the woman  involved in the dream also in a menacing way somehow is a dog
standing rigidly in the distance past the oriental woman  motionless and rigid  in profile  standing there still and straight as a toy 
the oriental woman has no particular expression and never says anything  though her face s scars have a certain elusive pattern to
them that seems like it wants to mean something  when gately opens his eyes again geoffrey day s gone  and his hospital bed
with its railings and i v  bottles on stands has been moved way over so that it s right up next to the bed of whoever the person in
the room s other bed is  so it s like gately and this unknown patient are a sexless old couple sleeping together but in separate beds 

 and gately s mouth goes oval and his eyes bug out with horror  and his effort at yelling hurts enough to wake him up  and his
eyelids shoot up and rattle like old windowshades  and his hospital bed s back where it s always been  and a nurse is giving the
anonymous guy in the other bed some sort of late night type shot you could tell was narcotic  and the patient  who has a very deep
voice  is crying  then somewhere later in the couple of hours before midnight s parking switch symphony on washington st 
outside is an unpleasantly detailed dream where the ghostish figure that s been flickering in and out of sight around the room
finally stays in one spot long enough for gately to really check him out  in the dream it s the figure of a very tall sunken chested
man in black frame glasses and a sweatshirt with old stained chinos  leaning back sort of casually or else morosely slumped 
resting its tailbone against the window sill s ventilator s whispering grille  with its long arms hanging at its sides and its ankles
casually crossed so that gately can even see the detail that the ghostly chinos aren t long enough for its height  they re the kind
kids used to call  highwa ters  in gately s childhood   a couple of bimmy gately s savager pals would corner some pencilnecked kid in those type too short trousers on the playground and go like  yo little brother where s the fucking flood   and then lay
the kid out with a head slap or chest shove so the inevitable violin went skittering ass over teakettle across the blacktop  in its
case  the creepy ghostish figure s arm sometimes  like  vanishes and then reappears at the bridge of its nose  pushing the glasses
up in a weary unconscious morose gesture  just like those kids in the high water pants on the playground always did in a weak
morose way that always somehow made gately himself want to shove them savagely in the chest  gately in the dream
experienced a painful adrenal flash of remorse and entertained the possibility that the figure represented one of the north shore
violin playing kids he d never kept his savage pals from abusing  now come in an adult state when gately was vulnerable and
mute  to exact some kind of payback  the ghostly figure shrugged its thin shoulders and said but no  it was nothing of the sort  it
was just a plain old wraith  one without any sort of grudge or agenda  just a generic garden variety wraith  gately sarcastically in
the dream thought that oh well then if it was just a garden variety wraith  is all  geez what a fucking relief  the wraith figure
smiled apologetically and shrugged  shifting its tailbone on the whispering grille a bit  there was an odd quality to its movements
in the dream  they were of regulation speed  the movements  but they seemed oddly segmented and deliberate  as if more effort
than necessary were going into them somehow  then gately considered that who knew what was necessary or normal for a selfproclaimed generic wraith in a pain and fever dream  then he considered that this was the only dream he could recall where even
in the dream he knew that it was a dream  much less lay there considering the fact that he was considering the up front dream
quality of the dream he was dreaming  it quickly got so multilevelled and confusing that his eyes rolled back in his head  the
wraith made a weary morose gesture as if not wanting to bother to get into any sort of confusing dream v  real controversies  the
wraith said gately might as well stop trying to figure it out and just capitalize on its presence  the wraith s presence in the room or
dream  whatever  because gately  if he d bothered to notice and appreciate it  at least didn t have to speak out loud to be able to
interface with the wraith figure  and also the wraith figure said it was by the way requiring incredible patience and fortitude for
him  the wraith  to stay in one position long enough for gately to really see him and interface with him  and the wraith was
making no promises about how many more months he  the wraith  could keep it up  since fortitude had never seemed to have been
his long suit  the city s aggregate nighttime lights lightened the sky through the room s window to the same dark rose shade you
see when you close your eyes  adding to the dream of dream type ambiguity  gately in the dream tried the test of pretending to
lose consciousness so the wraith would go away  and then somewhere during the pretense lost consciousness and really did sleep 
for a bit  in the dream  because the tiny pocked oriental woman was back and looking wordlessly down at him  plus the creepy
rigid dog  and then the sedated patient in the next bed woke gately back up  in the original dream  with some kind of narcotized
gurgle or snore  and the so called wraith figure was still there and visible  only now it was standing on top of the railing at the side
of gately s bed  looking down at him now from a towering railing plus original tallness height  having to exaggerate his
shoulders  natural slump in order to clear the ceiling  gately got a clear view of an impressive thatch of nostril hair  looking up
into the wraith s nostrils  and also a clear lateral look at the wraith s skinny ankles  like ankle bones bulging in brown socks below
the cuffs of the highwater chinos  as much as his shoulder  calf  toe  and whole right side were hurting  it occurred to gately that
you don t normally think of wraiths or ghost  ish phantasms as being tall or short  or having bad posture  or wearing certaincolored socks  much less having anything as specific as extrusive nostril hair  there was a degree of  what  specificness about this
figure in this dream that gately found troubling  much less having the unpleasant old oriental woman dream inside this dream
right here  he began to wish again that he could call out for assistance or to wake himself up  but now not even moos or mews
would come  all he could seem to do was pant real hard  as if the air was like totally missing his vocal box  or like his vocal box
was totally demapped from nerve damage in his shoulder and now just sort of hung there all withered and dry like an old hornet
nest while air rushed out gately s throat all around it  his throat still didn t feel right  it was exactly the suffocated speechlessness
in dreams  nightmares  gately realized  this was both terrifying and reassuring  somehow  evidence for the dream element and so
on and so forth  the wraith was looking down at him and nodding sympathetically  the wraith could empathize totally  it said 
the wraith said even a garden variety wraith could move at the speed of quanta and be anywhere anytime and hear in symphonic
toto the thoughts of animate men  but it couldn t ordinarily affect anybody or anything solid  and it could never speak right to
anybody  a wraith had no out loud voice of its own  and had to use somebody s like internal brain voice if it wanted to try to
communicate something  which was why thoughts and insights that were coming from some wraith always just sound like your
own thoughts  from inside your own head  if a wraith s trying to interface with you  the wraith says by way of illustration
consider phenomena like intuition or inspiration or hunches  or when someone for instance says  a little voice inside  was telling
them such and such on an intuitive basis  gately can now take no more than a third of a normal breath without wanting to throw
up from the pain  the wraith was pushing his glasses up and saying besides  it took incredible discipline and fortitude and patient
effort to stay stock still in one place for long enough for an animate man actually to see and be in any way affected by a wraith 
and very few wraiths had anything important enough to interface about to be willing to stand still for this kind of time  preferring
ordinarily to whiz around at the invisible speed of quanta  the wraith says it doesn t really matter whether gately knows what the
term quanta means  he says wraiths by and large exist  putting his arms out slowly and making little quotation mark fingerwiggles as he said exist  in a totally different heisenbergian dimension of rate change and time passage  as an example  he goes
on  normal animate men s actions and motions look  to a wraith  to be occurring at about the rate a clock s hour hand moves  and
are just about as interesting to look at  gately was thinking for fuck s sake what was this  now even in unpleasant fever dreams

 now somebody else is going to tell him their troubles now that gately can t get away or dialogue back with anything about his
own experience  he normally couldn t ever get ewell or day to sit down for any kind of real or honest mutual sharing  and now
that he s totally mute and inert and passive all of a sudden everybody seems to view him as a sympathetic ear  or not even a
sympathetic real ear  more like a wooden carving or statue of an ear  an empty confessional booth  don g  as huge empty
confessional booth  the wraith disappears and instantly reappears in a far corner of the room  waving hi at him  it was slightly
reminiscent of  bewitched  reruns from gately s toddlerhood  the wraith disappears again and again just as instantly reappears 
now holding one of gately s ennet house basement flea baggy staff bedroom s cut out and scotch taped celebrity photos  this
one an old one of u s  head of state johnny gentle  famous crooner  on stage  wearing velour  twirling a mike  from back in the
days before he went to a copper colored toupee  when he used a strigil instead of a uv flash booth and was just a vegas crooner 
again the wraith disappears and instantly reappears holding a can of coke  with good old coke s distinctive interwoven red and
white french curls on it but alien unfamiliar oriental type writing on it instead of the good old words coca cola and coke  the
unfamiliar script on the coke can is maybe the whole dream s worst moment  the wraith walks jerkily and overdeliberately across
the floor and then up a wall  occasionally disappearing and then reappearing  sort of fluttering mistily  and ends up standing
upside down on the hospital room s drop ceiling  directly over gately  and holds one knee to its sunken chest and starts doing
what gately would know were pirouettes if he d ever once been exposed to ballet  pirouetting faster and faster and then so fast the
wraith s nothing but a long stalk of sweatshirt and coke can colored light that seems to extrude from the ceiling  and then  in a
moment that rivals the coke can moment for unpleasantness  into gately s personal mind  in gately s own brain voice but with
roaring and unwilled force  comes the term pirouette  in caps  which term gately knows for a fact he doesn t have any idea
what it means and no reason to be thinking it with roaring force  so the sensation is not only creepy but somehow violating  a sort
of lexical rape  gately begins to consider this hopefully nonrecurring dream even more unpleasant than the tiny pocked orientalwoman dream  overall  other terms and words gately knows he doesn t know from a divot in the sod now come crashing through
his head with the same ghastly intrusive force  e g  acciac catura and alembic  latrodectus mactans and
neutral density point  chiaroscuro and proprioception and testudo and annulate and bricolage
and catalept and gerrymander and scopophilia and laertes   and all of a sudden it occurs to gately the
aforethought extruding  strigil and lexical themselves   and lordosis and impost and sinistral and
meniscus and chronaxy and poor yorick and luculus and cerise montclair and then d  sica neoreal crane dolly and circumambientfounddramaleviratemar riage and then more lexical terms and
words speeding up to chipmunkish and then heliated and then all the way up to a sound like a mosquito on speed  and gately
tries to clutch both his temples with one hand and scream  but nothing comes out  when the wraith reappears  it s seated way up
behind him where gately has to let his eyes roll way back in his head to see him  and it turns out gately s heart is being medically
monitored and the wraith is seated up on the heart monitor in a strange cross legged posture with his pantcuffs pulled up so high
gately could see the actual skinny hairless above the sock skin of the wraith s ankles  glowing a bit in the spilled light of the
trauma wing hall  the oriental can of coke now rests on gately s broad flat forehead  it s cold and smells a little funny  like low
tide  the can  now footsteps and the sound of bubblegum in the hall  an orderly shines a flashlight in and plays it over gately and
the narcotized roommate and environs  and makes marks on a clipboard while blowing a small orange bubble  it s not like the light
passes through the wraith or anything dramatic   the wraith simply disappears the instant the light hits the heart monitor and
reappears the instant it moves away  gately s unpleasant dreams definitely don t normally include specific gum color and intense
physical discomfort and invasions of lexical terms he doesn t know from shinola  gately begins to conclude it s not impossible that
the garden variety wraith on the heart monitor  though not conventionally real  could be a sort of epiphanyish visitation from
gately s personally confused understanding of god  a higher power or something  maybe sort of like the legendary pulsing blue
light that aa founder bill w  historically saw during his last detox  that turned out to be god telling him how to stay sober via
starting aa and carrying the message  the wraith smiles sadly and says something like don t we both wish  young sir  gately s
forehead wrinkling as his eyes keep rolling up makes the foreign can wobble coldly  of course there s also the possibility that the
tall slumped extremely fast wraith might represent the sergeant at arms  the disease  exploiting the loose security of gately s
fever addled mind  getting ready to fuck with his motives and persuade him to accept demerol just once  just one last time  for the
totally legitimate medical pain  gately lets himself wonder what it would be like  able to quantum off anyplace instantly and stand
on ceilings and probably burgle like no burglar d ever dreamed of  but not able to really affect anything or interface with anybody 
having nobody know you re there  having people s normal rushed daily lives look like the movements of planets and suns  having
to sit patiently very still in one place for a long time even to have some poor addled son of a bitch even be willing to entertain
your maybe being there  it d be real free seeming  but incredibly lonely  he imagines  gately knows a thing or two about
loneliness  he feels  does wraith mean like a ghost  as in dead  is this a message from a higher power about sobriety and death 
what would it be like to try and talk and have the person think it was just their own mind talking  gately could maybe identify  to
an extent  he decides  this is the only time he s ever been struck dumb except for a brief but nasty bout of pleuritic laryngitis he d
had when he was twenty four and sleeping on the cold beach up in gloucester  and he doesn t like it a bit  the being struck dumb 
it s like some combination of invisibility and being buried alive  in terms of the feeling  it s like being strangled somewhere deeper
inside you than your neck  gately imagines himself with a piratical hook  unable to speak on commitments because he can only
gurgle and pant  doomed to an aa life of ashtrays and urns  the wraith reaches down and removes the can of un american tonic
from gately s forehead and assures gately he can more than identify with an animate man s feelings of communicative impotence
and mute strangulation  gately s thoughts become agitated as he tries to yell mentally that he never said a fucking thing about
impotence  he s got a way clearer and more direct view of the wraith s extreme nostril hair situation than he d prefer to  the
wraith hefts the can absently and says age twenty eight seems old enough for gately to remember u s  broadcast television s old
network situation comedies of the b s     s and    s  probably  gately has to smile at the wraith s cluelessness  gately s after all a
fucking drug addict  and a drug addict s second most meaningful relationship is always with his domestic entertainment unit 
tv vcr or hdtp  a drug addict s maybe the only human species whose own personal vision has a vertical hold  for christ s
sake  he thinks  and gately  even in recovery  can still summon great verbatim chunks not only of drug addicted adolescence s
 seinfeld  and  ren and stimpy  and  oo is  e when  e s at  ome  and  exposed northerners  but also the syndicated  bewitched  and

  hazel  and ubiquitous  m a s h  he grew to monstrous childhood size in front of  and especially the hometown ensemble casted
 cheers    both the late network version with the stacked brunette and the syndicated older ones with the titless blond  which
gately even after the switch over to interlace and hdtp dissemination felt like he had a special personal relationship with
 cheers    not only because everybody on the show always had a cold foamer in hand  just like in real life  but because gately s big
childhood claim to recognition had been his eerie resemblance to the huge neckless simian browed accountant nom who more or
less seemed to live at the bar  and was unkind but not cruel  and drank foamer after foamer without once hitting anybody s mom
or pitching over sideways and passing out in vomit somebody else had to clean up  and who d looked   right down to the massive
square head and neanderthal brow and paddle sized thumbs   eerily like the child d  w    bim   gately  hulking and neckless
and shy  riding his broom handle  sir osis of thuliver  and the wraith on the heart monitor looks pensively down at gately from
upside down and asks does gately remember the myriad thespian extras on for example his beloved  cheers    not the center stage
sam and carla and nom  but the nameless patrons always at tables  filling out the bar s crowd  concessions to realism  always
relegated to back  and foreground  and always having utterly silent conversations  their faces would animate and mouths move
realistically  but without sound  only the name stars at the bar itself could audibilize  the wraith says these fractional actors 
human scenery  could be seen  but not heard  in most pieces of filmed entertainment  and gately remembers them  the extras in
all public scenes  especially like bar and restaurant scenes  or rather remembers how he doesn t quite remember them  how it never
struck his addled mind as in fact surreal that their mouths moved but nothing emerged  and what a miserable fucking bottom rung
job that must be for an actor  to be sort of human furniture  figurants the wraith says they re called  these surreally mute
background presences whose presence really revealed that the camera  like any eye  has a perceptual corner  a triage of who s
important enough to be seen and heard v  just seen  a term from ballet  originally  figurant  the wraith explains  the wraith pushes
his glasses up in the vaguely snivelling way of a kid that s just got slapped around on the playground and says he personally spent
the vast bulk of his own former animate life as pretty much a figurant  furniture at the periphery of the very eyes closest to him  it
turned out  and that it s one heck of a crummy way to try to live  gately  whose increasing self pity leaves little room or patience
for anybody else s self pity  tries to lift his left hand and wiggle his pinkie to indicate the world s smallest viola playing the theme
from the sorrow and the pity  but even moving his left arm makes him almost faint  and either the wraith is saying or gately is
realizing that you can t appreciate the dramatic pathos of a figurant until you realize how completely trapped and encaged he is in
his mute peripheral status  because like say for example if one of  cheers    s bar s figurants suddenly decided he couldn t take it
any more and stood up and started shouting and gesturing around wildly in a bid for attention and nonperipheral status on the
show  gately realizes  all that would happen is that one of the audibilizing  name  stars of the show would bolt over from stagecenter and apply restraints or the heineken maneuver or cpr  figuring the silent gesturing figurant was choking on a beer nut or
something  and that then the whole rest of that episode of  cheers   would be about jokes about the name star s life saving heroics 
or else his fuck up in applying the heineken maneuver to somebody who wasn t choking on a nut  no way for a figurant to win 
no possible voice or focus for the encaged figurant  gately speculates briefly about the suicide statistics for bottom rung actors 
the wraith disappears and then reappears in the chair by the bed s railing  leaning forward with its chin on its hands on the railing
in what gately s coming to regard as the classic tell your troubles to the trauma patient that can t interrupt or get away position 
the wraith says that he himself  the wraith  when animate  had dabbled in filmed entertainments  as in making them  cartridges 
for gately s info to either believe or not  and but in the entertainments the wraith himself made  he says he goddamn bloody well
made sure that either the whole entertainment was silent or else if it wasn t silent that you could bloody well hear every single
performer s voice  no matter how far out on the cinematographic or narrative periphery they were  and that it wasn t just the selfconscious overlapping dialogue of a poseur like schwulst or altman  i e  it wasn t just the crafted imitation of aural chaos  it was
real life s real egalitarian babble of figurantless crowds  of the animate world s real agora  the babble       of crowds every
member of which was the central and articulate protagonist of his own entertainment  it occurs to gately he s never had any sort of
dream where somebody says anything like vast bulk  much less agora  which gately interprets as a kind of expensive sweater 
which was why  the wraith is continuing  the complete unfiguranted egalitarian aural realism was why party line entertainmentcritics always complained that the wraith s entertainments  public area scenes were always incredibly dull and self conscious and
irritating  that they could never hear the really meaningful central narrative conversations for all the unaltered babble of the
peripheral crowd  which they assumed the babble  babel  was some self conscious viewer hostile heavy art directorial pose 
instead of radical realism  the wraith s grim smile almost disappears before it appears  gately s slight tight smile back is the way
you can always tell he s not really listening  he s remembering that he used to pretend to himself that the unviolent and sarcastic
accountant nom on  cheers   was gately s own organic father  straining to hold young bimmy on his lap and letting him draw
finger pictures in the condensation rings on the bartop  and when he was pissed off at gately s mother being sarcastic and witty
instead of getting her down and administering horribly careful u s  navy brig type beatings that hurt like hell but would never
bruise or show  the can of foreign coke has left a ring on his forehead that s colder than the feverish skin around it  and gately
tries to concentrate on the cold of the ring instead of the dead cold total ache on his whole right side   dextral   or the sober
memory of his mother mrs  gately s ex significant other  the little eyed former m p  in khaki skivvies hunched drunk over his
notebook s record of his heinekens for the day  his tongue in the corner of his mouth and his eyes scrunched as he tries to see a
unitary enough notebook to write in  gately s mother on the floor trying to crawl off toward the lockable bathroom quietly enough
so the m p  wouldn t notice her again  the wraith says just to give gately an idea  he  the wraith  in order to appear as visible and
interface with him  gately  he  the wraith  has been sitting  still as a root  in the chair by gately s bedside for the wraith equivalent
of three weeks  which gately can t even imagine  it occurs to gately that none of the people that ve dropped by to tell him their
troubles has bothered to say how many days he s even been in the trauma wing now  or what day it s going to be when the sun
comes up  and so gately has no idea how long he s gone now without an aa meeting  gately wishes his sponsor ferocious
francis g  would hobble by instead of ennet staff that want to talk about prosfeces and residents who come just to share remembered wreckage with somebody they don t even think can even hear them  sort of the way a little kid confides to a dog  he doesn t
let himself even contemplate why no finest or federally crew cut guys have visited yet  if he s been in here a while  if they ve been
all over the house like hamsters on wheat already  as thrust had said  the seated shadow of somebody in a hat is still there out
there in the hall  though if the whole interlude was a dream it isn t and has never been there  gately realizes  squinting a little to try

 to make sure the shadow is the shadow of a hat and not a fire extinguisher box on the hall wall or something  the wraith excuses
himself and disappears but then reappears two slow blinks later  back in the same position   that was worth an excuse me  
gately thinks at the wraith dryly  almost laughing  the sheet of pain from the near laugh send his eyes way up back up in his
head  the chassis of the heart monitor doesn t look broad enough to support even a wraith s ass  the heart monitor s the silent
kind  it s got the moving white line with big speed bumps moving across it for gately s pulse  but it doesn t make the sterile
beeping that old hospital drama monitors did  patients in hospital dramas were frequently unconscious figurants  gately reflects 
the wraith says he d just paid a small quantumish call to the old spotless brighton two decker of one ferocious francis gehaney 
and from the way the old crocodile s shaving and putting on a clean white t shirt  the wraith says  he predicts f f  will be visiting
the trauma wing soon to offer gately unconditional empathy and fellowship and acerbic crocodilian counsel  unless this was
just gately himself thinking this up to keep a stiff upper attitude  gately thinks  the wraith pushes his glasses up sadly  you never
think of a wraith looking sad or unsad  but this dream wraith displays the whole affective range  gately can hear the horns and
raised voices and u turn squeals way down below on wash  that indicate it s around ooooh   the switching hour  he wonders
what something as brief as a car horn honk sounds like to a figurant that has to sit still for three weeks to be seen  wraith  not
figurant  gately meant  he corrects himself  he s lying here correcting his thoughts like he was talking  he wonders if his brainvoice talks fast enough for the wraith not to have to like tap its foot and look at its watch between words  are they words if they re
only in your head  though  the wraith blows its nose in a hankie that s visibly seen better epochs and says he  the wraith  when
alive in the world of animate men  had seen his own personal youngest offspring  a son  the one most like him  the one most
marvelous and frightening to him  becoming a figurant  toward the end  his end  not the son s end  the wraith clarifies  gately
wonders if it offends the wraith when he sometimes refers to it mentally as it  the wraith opens and examines the used hankie just
like an alive person can never help but do and says no horror on earth or elsewhere could equal watching your own offspring open
his mouth and have nothing come out  the wraith says it mars the memory of the end of his animate life  this son s retreat to the
periphery of life s frame  the wraith confesses that he had  at one time  blamed the boy s mother for his silence  but what good
does that kind of thing do  he said  making a blurred motion that might have been shrugging  gately remembers the former navy
m p  telling gately s mother why it was her fault he lost his job at the chowder plant   resentment is the  l offender  is another
boston aa cliche gately d started to believe  that blame s a shell game  not that he wouldn t mind a private couple of minutes
alone in a doorless room with randy lenz  once he was up and capable again  though 
the wraith reappears slumped back in the chair with his weight on his tailbone and his legs crossed in that erdedyish upscale
way  he says just imagine the horror of spending your whole itinerant lonely southwest and west coast boyhood trying
unsuccessfully to convince your father that you even existed  to do something well enough to be heard and seen but not so well
that you became just a screen for his own  the dad s  projections of his own failure and self loathing  failing ever to be really seen 
gesturing wildly through the distilled haze  so that in adulthood you still carried the moist flabby weight of your failure ever to
make him hear you really speak  carried it on through the animate years on your increasingly slumped shoulders   only to find 
near the end  that your very own child had himself become blank  inbent  silent  frightening  mute  i e  that his son had become
what he  the wraith  had feared as a child he  the wraith  was  gately s eyes roll up in his head  the boy  who did everything well
and with a natural unslumped grace the wraith himself had always lacked  and whom the wraith had been so terribly eager to see
and hear and let him  the son  know he was seen and heard  the son had become a steadily more and more bidden boy  toward the
wraith s life s end  and no one else in the wraith and boy s nuclear family would see or acknowledge this  the fact that the graceful
and marvelous boy was disappearing right before their eyes  they looked but did not see his invisibility  and they listened but did
not hear the wraith s warning  gately has that slight tight absent smile again  the wraith says the nuclear family had believed he
 the wraith  was unstable and was confusing the boy with his own  the wraith s  boyhood self  or with the wraith s father s father 
the blank wooden man who according to family mythology had  driven  the wraith s father to  the bottle  and unrealized potential
and an early cerebral hemorrhage  toward the end  he d begun privately to fear that his son was experimenting with substances 
the wraith keeps having to push its glasses up  the wraith says almost bitterly that when he d stand up and wave his arms for
them all to attend to the fact that his youngest and most promising son was disappearing  they d thought all his agitation meant
was that he had gone bats from wild turkey intake and needed to try to get sober  again  one more time 
this gets gately s attention  here at last could be some sort of point to the unpleasantness and confusion of the dream   you
tried to get sober   he thinks  rolling his eyes over to the wraith   more than once  you tried  was it white knuckle        did
you ever surrender and come in  
the wraith feels along his long jaw and says he spent the whole sober last ninety days of his animate life working tirelessly to
contrive a medium via which he and the muted son could simply converse  to concoct something the gifted boy couldn t simply
master and move on from to a new plateau  something the boy would love enough to induce him to open his mouth and come out
  even if it was only to ask for more  games hadn t done it  professionals hadn t done it  impersonation of professionals hadn t
done it  his last resort  entertainment  make something so bloody compelling it would reverse thrust on a young self s fall into the
womb of solipsism  an hedonia  death in life  a magically entertaining toy to dangle at the infant still somewhere alive in the boy 
to make its eyes light and toothless mouth open unconsciously  to laugh  to bring him  out of himself   as they say  the womb
could be used both ways  a way to say i am so very  very sorry and have it heard  a life long dream  the scholars and
foundations and disseminators never saw that his most serious wish was  to entertain 
gately s not too agonized and feverish not to recognize gross self pity when he hears it  wraith or no  as in the slogan  poor
me  poor me  pour me a drink   with all due respect  pretty hard to believe this wraith could stay sober  if he needed to get
sober  with the combination of abstraction and tragically misunderstood me attitude he s betraying  in the dream 
he d been sober as a mennonite quilter for    days  at the very tail end of his life  the wraith avers  now back up on the silent
heart monitor  though boston aa had a humorless evangelical rabidity about it that had kept his attendance at meetings spotty 
and he never could stand the vapid cliches and disdain for abstraction  not to mention the cigarette smoke  the atmosphere of the
meeting rooms had been like a poker game in hell  had been his impression  the wraith stops and says he bets gately s struggling
to hide his curiosity about whether the wraith succeeded in coming up with a figurant less entertainment so thoroughly engaging
it d make even an in bent figurant of a boy laugh and cry out for more 

 father figure wise  gately s tried his best these last few sober months to fend off uninvited memories of his own grim
conversations and interchanges with the m p 
the wraith on the monitor now bends sharply at the waist  way over forward so his face is upside down only cm  from
gately s face   the wraith s face is only about half the size of gately s face  and has no odor   and responds vehemently that no 
no  any conversation or interchange is better than none at all  to trust him on this  that the worst kind of gut wrenching
intergenerational interface is better than withdrawal or hidden ness on either side  the wraith apparently can t tell the difference
between gately just thinking to himself and gately using his brain voice to sort of think at the wraith  his shoulder suddenly
sends up a flare of pain so sickening gately s afraid he might shit the bed  the wraith gasps and almost falls off the monitor as if
he can totally empathize with the dextral flare  gately wonders if the wraith has to endure the same pain as gately in order to hear
his brain voice and have a conversation with him  even in a dream  that d be a higher price than anybody s ever paid to interface
with d  w  gately  maybe the pain s supposed to lend credibility to some diseased argument for demerol the wraith s going to
make  gately feels somehow too self conscious or stupid to ask the wraith if it s here on behalf of the higher power or maybe the
disease  so instead of thinking at the wraith he simply concentrates on pretending to wonder to himself why the wraith is spending
probably months of aggregate wraith time flitting around a hospital room and making pirouetted demonstrations with croonerphotos and foreign tonic cans on the ceiling of some drug addict he doesn t know from a rock instead of just quantuming over to
wherever this alleged youngest son is and holding very still for wraith months and trying to have an interface with the fucking
son  though maybe thinking he was seeing his late organic dad as a ghost or wraith would drive the youngest son bats  though 
might be the thing  the son didn t exactly sound like the steadiest hand on the old mental joystick as it was  from what the wraith s
shared  of course this was assuming the mute figurant son even existed  this was assuming this wasn t all some roundabout way of
the disease starting to talk gately into succumbing to a shot of demerol  he tries to concentrate on all this instead of
remembering what demerol s warm rush of utter well being felt like  remembering the comfortable sound of the clunk of his chin
against his chest  or instead of remembering any of his own interchanges with his mother s live in retired m p  one of the highest
prices of sobriety was not being able to keep from remembering things you didn t want to remember  see for instance ewell and
the fraudulent grandiosity thing from his wie nieish childhood  the ex m p  had referred to small children and toddlers as  rugrats   it was not a term of gruff affection  the m p  had made the toddler don gately return empty heineken bottles to the
neighborhood packy and then haul ass on back with the bottle deposits  timing him with a u s n  issue chronometer  he never
laid a hand on gately personally  that don could recall  but he d still been afraid of the m p  the m p  d beaten his mother up on
an almost daily basis  the most hazardous time for gately s mother was between eight heinekens and ten heinekens  when the
m p  threw her on the floor and knelt down very intently over her  picking his spots and hitting her very intently  he d looked like
a lobsterman pulling at his outboard s rope  the m p  was slightly shorter than mrs  gately but was broad and very muscular  and
proud of his muscles  going shirtless whenever possible  or in like sleeveless khaki military t s  he had bars and weights and
benches  and had taught the child don gately the fundamentals of free weight training  with special emphasis on control and form
as opposed to just sloppily lifting as much weight as possible  the weights were old and greasy and their poundage pre metric 
the m p  was very precise and controlled in his approach to things  in a way gately has somehow come to associate with all
blond haired men  when gately  at age ten  began to be able to bench press more weight than the m p   the m p  had not taken it
in a good spirit and began refusing to spot him on his sets  the m p  entered his own weights and repetitions carefully in a little
notebook  pausing to do this after each set  he always licked the point of the pencil before he wrote  a habit gately still finds
repellent  in a different little notebook  the m p  noted the date and time of each heineken he consumed  he was the sort of person
who equated incredibly careful record keeping with control  in other words he was by nature a turd counter  gately had realized
this at a very young age  and that it was bullshit and maybe crazy  the m p  was very possibly crazy  the circumstances of his
leaving the navy were like  shadowy  when gately involuntarily remembers the m p  now he also remembers   and wonders
why  and feels bad   that he never once asked his mother about the m p  and why the fuck was he even there and did she actually
love him  and why did she love him when he flang her down and beat her up on a more or less daily basis for fucking years on
end  the intensifying rose colors behind gately s closed lids are from the hospital room lightening as the light outside the window
gets licoricey and predawn  gately lies below the unoccupied heart monitor snoring so hard the railings on either side of his bed
shiver and rattle  when the m p  was sleeping or out of the house  don gately and mrs  gately never once talked about him  his
memory is clear on this  it wasn t just that they never discussed him  or the notebooks or weights or chronometer or his beating up
mrs  gately  the m p  s name was never even mentioned  the m p  worked nights a lot   driving a cheese and egg delivery
truck for cheese king inc  until he was terminated for embezzling wheels of stilton and fencing them  then for a time on a mostly
automated canning line  pulling a lever that sent new england chowder out of hundreds of spigots into hundreds of lidless cans
with an indescribable plopping sound   and the gately home was like a different world when the m p  was working or out  it was
like the very idea of the m p  walked out the door with him  leaving don and his mother not just behind but alone  together  at
night  she on the couch and he on the floor  both gradually losing consciousness in front of broadcast tv s final seasons  gately
tries especially hard now not to explore why it never occurred to him to step in and pull the m p  off his mother  even after he
could bench press more than the m p  the precise daily beatings had always seemed in some strangely emphatic way not his
business  he rarely even felt anything  he remembers  watching him hit her  the m p  was totally unshy about hitting her in front
of gately  it was like everybody unspokenly agreed the whole thing was none of bimmy s beeswax  when he was a toddler he d
flee the room and cry about it  he seems to recall  by a certain age  though  all he d do is raise the volume on the television  not
even bothering to look over at the beating  watching  cheers   sometimes he d leave the room and go into the garage and lift
weights  but when he left the room it was never like he was fleeing the room  when he d been small he d sometimes hear the
springs and sounds from their bedroom sometimes in the a m  and worry that the m p  was beating her up on their bed  but at a
certain point without anybody taking him aside and explaining anything to him he realized that the sounds then didn t mean she
was getting hurt  the similarity of her hurt sounds in the kitchen and living room and her sex sounds through the asbestos
fiberboard bedroom wall troubles gately  though  when he remembers now  and is one reason why he fends off remembering 
when awake 
shirtless in the summer   and pale  with a blond man s dislike for the sun   the m p  would sit in the little kitchen  at the

 kitchen table  feet flat on the wood grain tiling  with a patriotic themed bandanna wrapped around his head  recording heinekens
in his little notebook  a previous tenant had thrown something heavy through the kitchen window once  and the window s screen
was fucked up and not quite flush  and houseflies came and went more or less at will  gately  when small  would be in there in the
kitchen with the m p  sometimes  the tile was better for his little cars  suspensions than nubbly carpet  what gately remembers  in
pain  bubbling just under the lid of sleep  is the special and precise way the m p  would handle the flies that came into the kitchen 
he used no swatter or rolled cone of herald  he had fast hands  the m p   thick and white and fast  he d whack them as they lit on
the kitchen table  the flies  but in a controlled way  not hard enough to kill them  he was very controlled and intent about it  he d
whack them just hard enough to disable them  then he d pick them up real precisely and remove either a wing or like a leg 
something important to the fly  he d take the wing or leg over to the beige kitchen waste basket and very deliberately hike the lid
with the foot pedal and deposit the tiny wing or leg in the wastebasket  bending at the waist  the memory is unbidden and very
clear  the m p  d wash his hands at the kitchen sink  using green generic dishwashing liquid  the maimed fly itself he d ignore
and allow to scuttle in crazed circles on the table until it got stuck in a sticky spot or fell off the edge onto the kitchen floor  the
conversation with the m p  that gately reexperiences in minutely dreamed detail was the m p   at about five heinekens 
explaining that maiming a fly was way more effective than killing a fly  for flies  a fly was stuck in a sticky spot of dried
heineken and agitating its wing as the m p  explained that a well maimed fly produced tiny little fly screams of pain and fear 
human beings couldn t hear a maimed fly s screams  but you could bet your fat little rug rat ass other flies could  and the screams
of their maimed colleagues helped keep them away  by the time the m p  would put his head on his big pale arms and grab a little
shut eye among the heineken bottles on the sun heated table there d often be several flies trapped in goo or scuttling in circles on
the table  sometimes giving odd little hops  trying to fly with one wing or no wings  possibly in denial  these flies  as to their like
condition  the ones that fell to the floor gately would hunch directly over on hands and knees  getting one big red ear down just
as close to the fly as possible  listening  his big pink forehead wrinkled  what makes gately most uncomfortable now as he starts
to try to wake up in the lemonlight of true hospital morning is that he can t remember putting the maimed flies out of their misery 
ever  after the m p  passed out  can t mentally see himself stepping on them or wrapping them in paper towels and flushing them
down the toilet or something  but he feels like he must have  it seems somehow real vital to be able to remember his doing
something more than just hunkering blankly down amid his transformer cars and trying to see if he could hear tiny agonized
screams  listening very intently  but he can t for the life of him remember doing more than trying to hear  and the sheer cerebral
stress of trying to force a more noble memory should have awakened him  on top of the dextral hurt  but he doesn t come all the
way awake in the big crib until the memory s realistic dream bleeds into a nasty fictional dream where he s wearing lenz s worsted
topcoat and leaning very precisely and carefully over the prone figure of the hawaiian dressed nuck whose head he s whacked
repeatedly against the hood s windshield  he s supporting his inclined weight on his good left hand against the warm throbbing
hood  bent in real close to the maimed head  his ear to the bleeding face  listening very intently  the head opens its red mouth 
the wet start gately finally wakes with jars his shoulder and side and sends a yellow sheet of pain over him that makes him
almost scream into the window s light  for about a year once at age twenty in maiden he d slept most nights in a home built loft in
the dorm of a certain graduate r n  nursing program in maiden  with a ragingly addicted r n  nursing student  in the loft  which
you needed a five rung ladder to get up into this loft and the thing was only a couple of feet under the ceiling  and every a m 
gately d awake out of some bad dream and sit up with a jolt and thwack his head against the ceiling  until after some time there
was a permanent concavity in the ceiling and a flattish spot in the curve of the top of his forehead he can still feel  lying here
blinking and holding his head with his good left hand  for a second  blinking and red with a m  fever  he thinks he sees ferocious
francis g  in the bedside chair  chin freshly shaved and dotted with bits of kleenex  posture stolid  his old man s saggy little tits
rising slowly under a clean white t   smiling grimly around blue tubes and an unlit cigar between his teeth and saying  well kid at
least you re still on this side of the fuckin  sod  i guess there s something to be said for that there  and are you as yet sober  then  
the crocodile says coolly  disappearing and then not reappearing after several blinks 
the forms and sound in the room is really only three white flaggers gately s never known or connected with that well  but
are apparently here stopping in on their way to work  to show empathy and support  bud o  and glenn k  and jack j  glenn k  in
daytime wears the gray jumpsuit and complex utility belt of a refrigeration technician 
 and who s the fellow in the hat outside   he s asking 
gately grunts in a frantic way that suggests the phoneme u 
 tall  well dressed  grumpy  cocky looking  piggy eyed  wearing a hat  civil service looking  black socks and brown shoes  
glenn k  says  pointing out toward the door where there s sometimes been the ominous shadow of a hat 
gately s teeth taste long unbrushed 
 looking settled in for a stay  surrounded with sports pages and the takeout foods of many cultures  laddie   says bud o   who
the story from before gately s time goes once hit his wife so hard in the blackout that made him come in he broke her nose and
bent it over flat against her face  which he asked her never to have repaired  as a daily visual reminder of the depths drink sunk
him to  so mrs  o  had gone around with her nose bent over flat against her left cheek   bud o  d tagged her with a left cross  
until u h i d  referred her to al anon  which eventually nurtured and supported mrs  o  into eventually telling bud o  to take a
flying fuck to the moon and getting her nose realigned back out front and leaving him for a male al anon in birkenstock sandals 
gately s bowels have gone watery with dread  he has all too clear memories of a certain remorseless revere a d a  s brown
shoes  piggy eyes  stetson w  feather  and penchant for third world takeout  he keeps grunting pathetically 
unsure how to be supportive  for a while the flaggers try to cheer gately up by telling him cpr jokes   cpr  is their term for
al anon  which is known to boston aas as the  church of perpetual revenge  
 what s an al anon relapse   asks glenn k 
 it is a twinge of compassion   says jack j   who has a kind of a facial tic 
 but what is an al anon salute   jack j  asks back 
the three all pause  and then jack j  puts the back of his hand to his brow and flutters his lashes martyrishly at the dropceiling  they all three of them laugh  they have no clue that if gately actually laughs he ll tear his shoulder s sutures  one side of
jack j  s face goes in and out of a tortured grimace that doesn t affect the other side of his face one bit  something that s always

 given gately the fantods  bud o  is waggling his finger disapprovingly at glenn k   to signify an al anon handshake  glenn k 
gives a lengthy impression of an al anon mom watching her alcoholic kid marching in some parade and getting more and more
outraged at how everybody s out of step except her kid  gately closes his eyes and moves his chest up and down a few times in a
dumbshow of polite laughter  so they ll think they ve cheered him up and screw  the little thoracic movements make his dextral
regions make him want to bite the side of his hand in pain  it s like a big wooden spoon keeps pushing him just under the surface
of sleep and then spooning him up for something huge to taste him  again and again 

   november year of the depend adult undergarment
after remy marathe and ossowiecke  and balbalis also  they all reported back negatively for all signs of this veiled
performer  m  fortier and marathe threw into an effect this finally most drastic of the operations for the locating of the master
entertainment  this was to acquire members of the immediate family of the auteur  perhaps in public 
marathe was charged with this operation s details  for m  broullime was now thrust into technical trouble killing on the
furthering field tests of viewer willingness  for one of the newly acquired test subjects   this was an eccentrically dressed and
extremely irritating without home man of the streets in a white wig appropriated with large bags filled of foreign cook ware and
extremely small in size ladies  undergarments   was discovered to have been being severing and pushing beneath the room of
storage s closed door the severed digits of the second of the newly acquired test subjects   this was a mis dressed and severely
weakened or addicted man dressed in the clothing of a gauche woman  carrying multiple purses of suspicious nature   rather than
his own digits  marring the statistics of broullime s field experiment to such the extent that m  fortier was forced to consider
whether to allow broullime to conduct a lethal technical interview of the wigged substituter of digits for reasons of anger only 
substantially  a technical interview of more importance was to be conducted in the city phoenix far across the u s  to the south  a
city s name fortier had amusement from  and departed before incoming weather to attend mile  luria p      in this conducting 
leaving the trusted remy marathe to charge details of the preliminary acquisition 
marathe  who had made his decision and call  did what he could  a direct assault upon the academy of tennis itself was
impossible  a f r s fear nothing in this hemisphere except tall and steep hillsides  their attack must not be direct  thus the
preliminary was to acquire and replace the tennis children of quebec  known by the a f r  to be even then en route to u s a  soil
for gala competition with the tennis children of this academy  marathe selected young balbalis  the one still with both the legs  
albeit paralyzed and stickishly withered  them   to lead the a f r  field detail which must intercept the provincial players 
marathe  he stayed at the cambridge shop of the antitois  withdrawing frequently to the jazz nights nearby of ryle s restaurant 
balbalis drove the modified van of dodge north into the increasingly heavy snowstorm  they bypassed the pongo checkpoint at
methuen ma  they would place a large mirror in the deserted road and delude the tennis bus that it must leave the road to avoid
impact  its own headlights would delude it  an old f l q  trick  two teams in the van s back assembled the mirror s components 
balbalis would not allow to stop for this assembly  the snowfall was worse in the convexity because of the fans to the south  what
used to be montpelier in vermont lay between e w d  grids but took bad fallout from the region of champlain and was
unoccupied and ghostly white with snow  balbalis permitted at montpelier a brief stop for final assembly and for those who were
incontinent to change their bags  balbalis pressed hard to the former place of st  johnsbury  where the mirror was installed across
the southbound lanes of the u s  interstate      balbalis did not complain that there were no tracks in the snow of the road to be
followed  he never complained  they arrived well early just south of the checkpoint at which provincial autoroute     became
the interstate      there was a brief period of the tension when it appeared that the night vision attachment for the binoculars had
been misplaced  balbalis remained cool and it was located  the plan was to intercept the travelling team of players and allow
a f r s to arrive at the place in their stead  marathe promised to conceive an excellent ruse to explain the wheelchairs and adult
beards of the false players  there was no smoking in the van while they waited for the children tennis players of their country to
appear at the checkpoint  the bus was forced to remain at the checkpoint for several minutes  the bus was large and chartered and
appeared warm within  above its windshield its lit rectangle of destination displayed the english word for charter  if the bus
survived the swerve from the highway s mirror and was operational after the crash of swerving  balbalis would drive this bus 
there was one brief argument over who would be required to drive the van  for balbalis refused to leave the van behind them even
if the bus was operational  if the bus was not operational  no more than six junior children as survivors could be accommodated in
the van  the rest would be allowed to die for leur rai pays  balbalis  he showed no preference one or the other way 
gately dreamed he was with ennet house resident joelle van dyne in a southern motel whose restaurant s authoritarian sign
said simply eat  in the u s  south  in high summer  brutally hot  the foliage outside the room s broken windowscreen a parched
khaki  the air glassy with heat  the ceiling fan rotating at a second hand s rate  the room s bed a lavish four poster  tall and squishy 
the bedspread nubbly  gately supine with his side on fire while newcomer joelle v d  raises her veil slightly to lick the sweat off
his lids and temples  whispering so the veil flutters around and fans him  promising him a p m  of near terminal pleasures 
undressing at the foot of the old tall bed  slowly  her loose light clothes moist with sweat and falling easily to the bare floor  and
an incredible female body  an inhuman body  the sort of body gately s only ever seen with a staple in its navel  a body like
something you d win in a raffle  and a fifth post forms on the four poster  so to speak  which erect post s long dormant height
obscures the nude newcomer s figure  and then when she moves around out of the pulsing shadow to lean in close and press her
inhuman body s face right up intimately close to his  she removes the veil  and on top of this body to die for is the unveiled
historical likeness of fucking winston churchill  complete with cigar and jowls and bulldog scowl  and the ghastliness of the
shock makes the rest of gately s body go rigid  the pain of which wakes him with a jolted attempt to sit up that itself causes such a
blast of pain that he half passes back out again and lies there with rolling eyes and a round mouth 
gately s also powerless over memories of the older type lady that had been their neighbor when he and his mother shared bed
and board with the m p  a mrs  waite  there was no mr  waite  the smeared window of the little empty garage the m p  kept his
weights in was right next to the spiny neglected garden mrs  waite kept in the narrow strip between the two houses  mrs  waite s
house had been shall we say indifferently maintained  mrs  waite s house had made the gately house look like the taj  there was
something wrong about mrs  waite  none of the parents said what it was  but none of the kids were allowed to play in her yard or

 ring her bell on halloween  gately never got clear on what was supposed to be wrong about her  but the little poor neighborhood s
psyche throbbed with something dire about mrs  waite  older kids drove across her lawn and shouted shit that gately never quite
made out  at night  the littler kids thought they had it  they were pretty sure mrs  waite was a witch  yes  she did look a little
witchy  but who over like fifty didn t  but the big thing was she kept jars of stuff she d jarred herself in her little garage  browngreen viscous nameless vegetoid stuff in mayonnaise jars stacked on steel shelves and rusty lidded and bearded with dust  the
littler kids snuck in and broke some of the jars and stole one and ran away in mortal terror to break it elsewhere and then run
again  they dared each other to ride their bikes in tiny diagonals across the edge of her lawn  they told each other stories of
seeing mrs  waite in a pointy hat roasting missing kids whose pictures were on milk cartons and pouring the juice into jars  some
of the bigger littler kids even tried that inevitable gag of putting a paper bag full of dog shit on her stoop and lighting it  it was
somehow a further indictment of mrs  waite that she never complained  she rarely left her house  mrs  gately would never say
what was wrong about mrs  waite but absolutely forbade don to fuck with her in any way  like mrs  gately was in any position
to enforce any  like  ibr biddings  gately never fucked with mrs  waite s stored jars or rode across her lawn  and never much
joined in on the witch stories  which who needed witches to fear and despise when you had the good old m p  right there at the
kitchen table  but he was still scared of her  when he d once seen her gnarly eyed face up against the smeared garage window one
p m  when he had left the m p  to beating mrs  gately and gone out to lift weights he screamed and almost dropped the benchpress bar on his adam s apple  but over the long haul of a low stimulation north shore childhood  he d gradually developed a
slight relationship with mrs  waite  he d never all that much liked her  it wasn t like she was this lovable but misunderstood old
lady  it s not like he ran to her dilapitated house to confide in her  or bond  but he went over once or twice  maybe  under
circumstances he d forgot  and had sat in her kitchen  interfaced a little  she was lucid  mrs  waite  and apparently continent  and
there was no pointy hat anywhere in sight  but her house smelled bad  and mrs  waite herself had swollen veiny ankles and little
white bits of that dried paste at the corners of her mouth and about a million newspapers stacked and mildewing all over the
kitchen  and the old lady basically radiated whatever mixture of unpleasantness and vulnerability it was that made you want to be
cruel to people  gately was never cruel to her  but it s not like he loved her or anything  when gately went over there the couple
times it was mostly when the m p  was canning chowder and his mother had passed out in vomit she expected somebody else to
clean up  and he probably wanted to act out his kid s anger by doing something mrs  g  d pathetically tried to forbid  he didn t eat
much of whatever mrs  waite offered  she never offered him viscous material from a jar  his memories of whatever they
discussed are unspecific  she hung herself  eventually  mrs  waite   as in eliminated her own map   and because it was fall and
cool she wasn t found for maybe weeks after  it wasn t gately who found her  a meter reader guy found her several weeks after
gately s eighth or ninth birthday  gately s birthday was the same week as several other kids s in the neighborhood  by some
chance  usually gately d have his party over with some of the other kids that were having their birthdays with a party  hats and
twister  x men videos  cake on chinette plates  etc  mrs  gately was together enough to come a couple times  in retrospect  the
other kids  parents let gately have birthdays with them because they d felt sorry for him  he s involuntarily realized  but at some
sober neighbors  party  part of which was for his own eighth or ninth birthday  he remembers how mrs  waite had left her house
and come rung the sober neighbor s bell and had brought a birthday cake  for the birthday  a neighborly gesture  gately d spilled
the beans on the annual mass party at a kitchen table interface with her  the cake was uneven and slightly tilted to one side  but it
was dark chocolate and decorated with four cursive names and had clearly been made with care  mrs  waite had spared gately the
humiliation of putting just his name on the cake as if the cake was especially for him  but it was  mrs  waite had saved up for a
long time to afford to make the cake  gately knew  he knew she smoked like a chimney and had given up cigarettes for weeks to
save up for something  she wouldn t tell him what  she d tried to make her scary eyes twinkle when she wouldn t tell  but he d seen
the mayonnaise jar full of quarters on a pile of papers and had wrestled with himself over promoting it  and won  but there were
only like nine candles on the cake when the party s mom brought it in  and a couple of the kids having birthdays were like twelve 
was the private tip off on who the cake was really for  the party s mom had taken the cake at the door and said thank you but
had neglected to invite mrs  waite in  gately was in a position during twister in the garage to see mrs  waite walking back home
across the street  slowly but very straightly and dignified and upright  a lot of the kids went to the garage door to look  mrs  waite
had rarely been seen outside her house before  and never off her property  the sober mom brought the cake in the garage and said
it was a touching gesture from mrs  waite across the street  but she wouldn t let anybody eat the cake or even come close enough
to it to blow out the nine candles  the candles didn t all match  the candles burned down far enough so that there was a smell of
burnt frosting before they went out  the cake sat tilted by itself in a corner of the clean garage  gately didn t defy the sober mom
or any of the kids and eat a piece of the cake  he didn t even go near it  he didn t join in the delicious whispery arguments about
what kind of medical waste or roasted kid renderings were in the cake  but he didn t stand up and argue with the other kids about
the fact of the poisoning  either  before the party climaxed and the other kids that had got presents opened their presents  the sober
mom had taken the cake into the kitchen when she thought nobody was watching and threw it out in the wastebasket  gately
remembers the cake must have landed upside down  because the unfrosted side was facing up in the waste basket when he snuck
in and had a look at the cake  mrs  waite had disappeared back inside her house way before the mom threw the cake away 
there s no way she could have seen the mom take the uneaten cake back inside the house  a couple days later gately had
promoted a couple packs of benson   hedges    s from a store    and put them in mrs  waite s mailbox  where junk mail and
utility bills were already piling up  he sometimes rang the bell but never saw her  her bell had been a buzzer instead of a bell  he
remembers  she got found by a frustrated meter reader some indefinite number of weeks after that  the circumstances of her death
and discovery became more dark myth for the littler kids  gately wasn t so into self torture as to think the cake getting not eaten
and getting thrown out was in any way connected with mrs  waite hanging herself  everybody had their own private troubles 
mrs  gately had explained to him  and even at that age he could see her point  it s not like he d like mourned mrs  waite  or
missed her  or even thought about her even once for many years after that  which is what makes it somehow worse that his next 
even more unpleasant joelle van dyne pain and fever dream takes place in what is  unmistakably and unavoidably  mrs  waite s
kitchen  in great detail  right down to the ceiling s light fixture full of dried bugs  the brimming ashtrays  the bar graph of stacked
globes  the maddening arrhythmic drip of the kitchen sink and the bad smell   a mixture of mildew and putrid fruit  gately is in
the ladder back kitchen chair he used to sit in  the one with one rung broken  and mrs  waite is in her chair opposite  seated on the

 thing he thought then was a weird pink doughnut instead of a hemorrhoid pillow  except in the dream gately s feet reach all the
way to rest on the floor s dank tile  and mrs  waite is played by veiled u h i d  house resident joelle van d   except without her
veil  and what s more without any clothes  as in starkers  gorgeous  with that same incredible body as in the other one except here
this time with the face not of a jowly british p m  but of a total female angel  not sexy so much as angelic  like all the world s light
had gotten together and arranged itself into the shape of a face  or something  it looks like somebody  joelle s face  but gately
can t for the life of him place who  and it s not just the distraction of the inhumanly gorgeous naked bod below  because the dream
is not like a sex dream  because in this dream  mrs  waite  who is joelle  is death  as in the figure of death  death incarnate 
nobody comes right out and says so  it s just understood  gately s sitting here in this depressing kitchen interfacing with death 
death is explaining that death happens over and over  you have many lives  and at the end of each one  meaning life  is a woman
who kills you and releases you into the next life  gately can t quite make out if it s like a monologue or if he s asking questions and
she s responding in a q a deal  death says that this certain woman that kills you is always your next life s mother  this is how it
works  didn t he know  in the dream everybody in the world seems to know this except gately  like he d missed that day in school
when they covered it  and so death s having to sit here naked and angelic and explain it to him  very patiently  more or less like
remedial reading at beverly h s  death says the woman who either knowingly or involuntarily kills you is always someone you
love  and she s always your next life s mother  this is why moms are so obsessively loving  why they try so hard no matter what
private troubles or issues or addictions they have of their own  why they seem to value your welfare above their own  and why
there s always a slight  like  twinge of selfishness about their obssessive mother love  they re trying to make amends for a murder
neither of you quite remember  except maybe in dreams  as death s explanation of death goes on gately understands really
important vague stuff more and more  but the more he understands the sadder he gets  and the sadder he gets the more unfocused
and wobbly becomes his vision of the death s joelle sitting nude on the pink plastic ring  until near the end it s as if he s seeing her
through a kind of cloud of light  a milky filter that s the same as the wobbly blur through which a baby sees a parental face
bending over its crib  and he begins to cry in a way that hurts his chest  and asks death to set him free and be his mother  and
joelle either shakes or nods her lovely unfocused head and says  wait 

   november year of the depend adult undergarment gaudeamus igitur
i was in a zoo  there were no animals or cages  but it was still a zoo  it was close to a nightmare and it woke me before
o ooh  mario was still asleep  gently lit by the window s view of tiny lights down the hill  he lay very still and soundless as
always  his poor hands folded on his chest  as if awaiting a lily  i put in a plug of kodiak  his four pillows brought mario s chin to
his chest when he slept  i was still producing excess saliva  and my one pillow was moist in a way i didn t want to turn on a light
and investigate  i didn t feel good at all  a sort of nausea of the head  the feeling seemed worst first thing in the morning  i d felt
for almost a week as if i needed to cry for some reason but the tears were somehow stopping just millimeters behind my eyes and
staying there  and so on 
i got up and went past the foot of mario s bed to the window to stand on one foot  sometime during the night heavy snow had
begun to fall  i had been ordered by delint and barry loach to stand on the left foot for fifteen minutes a day as therapy for the
ankle  the countless little adjustments necessary to balance on one foot worked muscles and ligaments in the ankle that were
therapeutically unreachable any other way  i always felt sort of dickish  standing on one foot in the dark with nothing to do 
the snow on the ground had a purple cast to it  but the falling and whirling snow was virgin white  yachting cap white  i
stood on my left foot for maybe five minutes tops  the boards and a p s       were three weeks from tomorrow at      in the
c b s        auditorium at b u  i could hear a night custodial crew rolling a mop bucket somewhere on another floor 
this was to be the first a m  without dawn drills since interdependence day  and everybody was invited to sleep in until
breakfast  there were to be no classes all weekend 
i d awakened too early yesterday  too  i d kept seeing kevin bain crawling my way in my sleep 
i straightened up my bed and put the pillow s wet side down and put on clean sweatpants and some socks that didn t smell
foul 
the closest mario comes to snoring is a thin sound he makes at the back of his throat  the sound is as if he s drawing out the
word key over and over  it s not an unpleasant sound  i estimated a good    cm  of snow on the ground  and it was really coming
down  in the purple half light the west courts  nets were half buried  their top halves shuddered in a terrible wind  all over the
subdormitory i could hear doors rattling slightly in their frames  as they did only in a bad wind  the wind gave the snowfall a
swirling diagonal aspect  snow was hitting the exterior of the window with a sandy sound  the basic view outside the window
was that of a briskly shaken paperweight   the kind with the xmas diorama and shakeable snow  the grounds  trees  fences and
buildings looked toylike and miniaturized somehow  in fact it was hard to distinguish new snow falling from extant snow simply
whirling around in the wind  it only then occurred to me to wonder whether and where we would play today s exhibition meet 
the lung wasn t yet up  but the sixteen courts under the lung wouldn t have accommodated more than an a only meet anyway  a
kind of cold hope flared in me because i realized this could be cancellation weather  the backlash of this hope was an even worse
feeling than before  i couldn t remember ever actively hoping not to have to play before  i couldn t remember feeling strongly one
way or the other about playing for quite a long time  in fact 
mario and i had begun to make a practice of keeping the phone console s power on at night but turning off the ringer  the
console s digital recorder had a light that pulsed once for each incoming message  the double flash of the recorder s light set up an
interesting interference pattern with the red battery light on the ceiling s smoke detector  the two lights flashing in synch on every
seventh phone flash and then moving slowly apart in a visual doppler  a formula for the temporal relation between two
unsyncopated flashes would translate spatially into the algebraic formula for an ellipse  i could see  pemulis had poured a terrific
volume of practical pre boards math into my head for two weeks  taking his own time and not asking for anything in return  being
almost suspiciously generous about it  then  since the wayne debacle  the little tutorials had ceased and pemulis himself had been
very scarce  twice missing meals and several times taking the truck for long periods without checking with any of the rest of us
about our truck needs  i didn t even try to factor in the rapid single flash of the phone s power unit display on the side of the tp 

 this would make it some sort calculus thing  and even pemulis had conceded that i was not hardwired for anything past algebra
and conic sections 
every november  between i  day and the whataburger invitational in tucson az  the academy holds a semipublic
exhibition meet for the  benefit  of e t a  s patrons and alumni and friends in the boston area  the exhibition is followed by a
semiformal cocktail party and dance in the dining hall  where players are required to appear showered and semiformal and
available for social intercourse with patrons  some of them all but check our teeth  last year heath pearson had appeared for the
gala in a red vest and bellboy s cap and furry tail  carrying a little organ and inviting patrons to grind the organ while he capered
around chattering  c t  was unamused  the whole fundraiser is a charles tavis innovation  c t  is far better at public relations
and pump priming than was himself  the exhibition and gala are possibly the climax of c t  s whole administrative year  he d
determined that mid november was the best time for a fundraiser  with the weather not yet bad and the tax year drawing to a close
but the u s  holiday season  with its own draining system of demands on goodwill  not yet under way  for the past three fiscal
years  the fundraiser s proceeds have all but paid for the spring s southeast tour and the european terre batu fest of june july 
the exhibition meet involved both genders  a and b teams and was always against some foreign junior squad  to give the
whole fundraising affair a patriotic kicker  the gentle fiction was that the meet was just one stop for the foreign squad on a whole
vague general u s  tour  but in truth c t  usually flew the foreigners in special  and at some expense  we had in the past done
battle with teams from wales  belize  the sudan  and mozambique  cynics might point to an absence of tennis juggernauts among
the opponents  last year s mozambique thing was a particular turkey shoot        and there d been an ugly xeno racist mood
among some of the spectators and patrons  a couple of whom cheerily compared the meet to mussolini s tanks rolling over
ethiopian spearchuckers  y d a u  s opponents were to be the quebec jr  davis and jr  wightman cup teams  and their arrival
from m i a  d orval       was keenly anticipated by struck and freer  who claimed that the quebecois jr  wightman girls were
normally sequestered and saw very few coed venues and would be available for broadening intercultural relations of all kinds 
it was improbable that anything was going to be landing on time at logan in this kind of snow  though 
the wind also produced a desolate moaning in all the ventilation ducts  mario said  key  and sometimes  ski   drawing them
out  it occurred to me that without some one hitters to be able to look forward to smoking alone in the tunnel i was waking up
every day feeling as though there was nothing in the day to anticipate or lend anything any meaning  i stood on one foot for a
couple more minutes  spitting into a coffee can i d left on the floor near the phone from the night before  the implied question 
then  would be whether the bob hope had somehow become not just the high point of the day but its actual meaning  that would
be pretty appalling  the penn   that was my hand strengthening ball for november was on the sill against the window  i d neither
carried nor squeezed my ball for several days  no one seemed to have noticed 
mario cedes me full control over the phone s ringer and answering machine  since he has trouble holding the receiver and the
only messages he ever gets are in house ones from the moms  i enjoyed leaving different outgoing messages on the machine  but
i refused ever to back the messages with music or digitally altered bits of entertainment  none of the e t a  phones was videocapable   another c t  decision  under c t  the academy s manual of honor codes  rules  and procedures had almost tripled in
length  probably our room s best message ever was ortho stice doing his deadly c t  impression  taking    seconds to list
possible reasons why mario and i couldn t answer the phone and outlining our probable reactions to all possible caller emotions
provoked my our unavailability  but at    seconds the thing wore thin after a while  our outgoing this week was something like
 this is the disembodied voice of hal incandenza  whose body is not now able         and so on  and then the standard invitation to
leave a message  it was honesty and abstinence week  after all  and this seemed a more truthful message to leave than the
pedestrian  this is hal incandenza         since the caller would pretty obviously be hearing a digital recording of me rather than me 
this observation owed a debt to pemulis  who for years and with several different roommates has retained the same recursive
message   this is mike pemulis s answering machine s answering machine  mike pemulis s answering machine regrets being
unavailable to take a first order message for mike pemulis  but if you ll leave a second order message at the sound of the clapping
hand  mike pemulis s answering machine will      and so on  which has worn so thin that very few of pemulis s friends or
customers can abide waiting through the tired thing to leave a message  which pemulis finds congenial  since no really relevant
caller would be fool enough to leave his name on any machine of pemulis s anyway 
plus it was also creepy that  when the face s effulgence becomes the boiled white of the trauma wing ceiling as he comes up
with a start up for air  the apparently real nondream joelle van d  is leaning over the bed s crib railing  wetting gately s big
forehead and horror rounded lips with a cool cloth  wearing sweatpants and a sort of loose brocaded hulpil whose lavender almost
matches the selvage on her clean veil  the hulpil s neckline is too high for there to be much cleavage action as she leans over him 
which gately regards as probably kind of a mercy  the two brownies joelle s got in her other hand  and her nails are bitten down
to the ragged quick  just like gately s  she says she liberated from the nurses  station and brought down for him  since morris h 
meant them for him and they re by all just rights his  but she can see he s in no shape to swallow  she says  she smells like peaches
and cotton  and there s a sweet evil whiff of the discount canadian gaspers so many of the residents smoke  and underneath those
smells gately can detect that she s got on a bit of perfume       
to amuse him she says  and lo  several times  gately makes his chest go up and down rapidly to signify amusement  he
declines either to moo or mew at her  out of embarrassment  her veil this morning has a springy light purple around the border 
and the hair framing the veil seems a darker red  duskier  than when she d first come into the house and refused meat  gately
hadn t been much into wyyy or madame psychosis  but he d sometimes run into people who were   organics men  mostly 
opium and brown heroin  terrible mulled wine   and he feels on top of the febrile pain and the creepiness of the amphetaminicwraith  and winston churchill face joelle and angelic maternal death joelle drearns an odd vividness in himself at being
swabbed and maybe even generally admired by someone who s an underground local intellectual dash art type celebrity  he
doesn t know how to explain it  like as if the fact that she s a public personage makes him feel somehow physically actuated  like
more there feeling  conscious of the way he s holding his face  hesitant to make his barnyard sounds  even breathing through his
nose so she won t smell his unbrushed teeth  he feels self conscious with her  joelle can tell  but what s admirable is he has no
idea how heroic or even romantic he looks  unshaven and intubated  huge and helpless  wounded in service to somebody who did
not deserve service  half out of his tree from pain and refusing narcotics  the last and pretty much only man joelle ever let herself

 admire in a romantic way had left and wouldn t even face up to why  instead erecting for himself a pathetic jealous fantasy about
joelle and his own poor father  whose only interest in joelle had been first aesthetic and then anti aesthetic 
joelle doesn t know that newly sober people are awfully vulnerable to the delusion that people with more sober time than
them are romantic and heroic  instead of clueless and terrified and just muddling through day by day like everybody else in aa is
 except maybe the fucking crocodiles  
joelle says she can t stay long this time  all nonworking residents have to report for the house s a m  daily meditation
meeting  as gately knows only too well  he isn t sure what she means by  this time   she describes the newest male resident s
weird limbo injury posture  and the way johnette foltz has to cut up this dave guy s supper and drop it into his open mouth bit by
bit like a bird with a chick  lifting her face to the ceiling makes the linen veil conform to the features of the face below  mouth
open wide in imitation of a chick  the crewneckish hulpil makes her hair s loose curls look dark and her wrists and hands look
pale  her hands s skin is taut and freckled and treed with veins  his bed s metal bars keep gately s rolling eyes from seeing
anything much south of her thorax until joelle finishes with the washcloth and retreats to the edge of the other bed  which at some
point has become empty and the crying guy s chart removed  and its crib railings folded down  and she sits on the edge of the bed
and crosses her legs  supporting one huarache s heel on the railing s joint  revealing she s got on white socks under flesh colored
huaraches and ancient baggy old birch colored sweatpants with b u m  down one leg  which gately s pretty sure he s seen at the
sunday a m  big book meeting on ken erdedy  and belong to erdedy  and he feels a flash of something unpleasant that she d be
wearing the upscale kid s pants  the a m  light outside has gone from sunny yellow white to now a kind of old dime gray  with
what looks like serious wind 
joelle eats the cream cheese brownies gately can t eat and works at pulling a kind of big notebookish thing out of her broad
cloth purse  she talks about last night s st  columbkill s       meeting  where they d all gone unsupervised because johnette f 
had to stay and keep an eye on glynn who was sick and on henderson and willis  who were under legal quarantine upstairs 
gately racks his ram for which fucking night st  columbkill s is  joelle says how last night s was st  collie s once a month
format where instead of a commitment they had that round robin discussion where somebody in the hall spoke for five minutes
and then picked the next speaker out of the hall s crowd  there d been a kentuckian there  which gately might recall she was from
kentucky  a kentucky newcomer there  wayne something  a real damaged looking boy who hailed from the good old blue grass
state but of late resided in a disconnected drainage pipe off a watershed facility down in the allston spur  he d said  this guy  she
said  said he was nineteen or thereabout  looked    some   had clothes that looked to be decomposing on him even as he stood at
the podium  had a ripe odor of drainage about him that produced hankies as far back as the fourth row  which he explained the
odor by admitting his residential drainage pipe was in fact  mostly  disconnected  like as in little used  joelle s voice is nothing like
the hollow resonant radio voice and she uses her hands a lot to talk  trying to recreate the whole thing for gately  trying to give
him a little bit of a meeting  gately realizes  with a slight tight smile of disbelief that he can t dredge up a mental meeting schedule
so he ll know what day this is 
some of the st  columbkillers were saying it was the longest single blackout they d ever heard of  this wayne fellow d said
he had no idea when  why or how he d ended up so far up north as metro boston ten years after his last memory  most compelling 
visually  wayne had had a deep diagonal furrow in his face  extending from right eyebrow to left lip corner   joelle traces the
length and angle with a ragged nailed finger across her veil   splaying his nose and upper lip and rendering him so violently
cross eyed he seemed to address both corners of the front row at the same time  this old wayne boy d sketched how the facial
dent   what wayne had called  the flaw   pointing at it like people might need help seeing what he was talking about   derived
from his very own personal hard drinking alcoholic   chicken farmer daddy  in the grip of the post binge horrors and seeing
subjective pests in a big way  one day  up and hitting wayne at age nine smack in the face with a hatchet one time when wayne
couldn t tell him where a certain ball jar of distilled spirits had been hidden the day before  against the possibility of the horrors 
it had been just him and his daddy and his maw     that was feeble     and     acres of chicken farm  wayne had said  wayne
said the flaw had just about healed up fine with fresh air and plenty of exercise when his daddy  trying one monday p m  to get
outside a late lunch of mush and syrup  up and clutched his skull  turned red and then blue and then purple  and died  little wayne
had reportedly wiped the face clean of mush  dragged the dead body under the farmhouse porch  wrapped it in purina chickenchow sacks  and told his feeble maw his daddy had gone off to lay up drunk  the diagonal dented kid had apparently then gone
off to school as usual  done some discreet w o m  advertising  and had brought home with him a different set of boys each day for
almost a week  charging them a fiveski a head to crawl under the porch and eyeball a bona fried dead man  late friday p m   he
recollected  he d set off with hard currency to the billiard establishment where the niggers       that sold distilled ball jars to his
late daddy was at  getting set to    lay up drunk as a cock on jimson     the next thing this wayne boy says he knows  he wakes up
in the partially disconnected nne pipe  one millennial decade older and with some    right nasty    medical issues the timer s bell
prevents him from sharing in detail 
and this old wayne boy had up and pointed to joelle to come speak next   almost as if he knew  as if he gut intuited some
sort of kinship  affinity of origin  
gately grunted softly to himself  he figured guys with ten year blackouts who live in pipes probably didn t have to much to
go on besides your gut type intuitions  he knew he needed to be reminded that this strange girl was only about three weeks clean
and still leaching substances out of her tissues and still utterly clueless  but he felt like he resented it whenever he got reminded 
joelle had the big flat book in her lap and was looking down at her thumb and flexing it  watching it flex  what was disconcerting
was that when her head was down the veil hung loose at the same vertical angle as when her head was up  only now it was
perfectly smooth and untextured  a smooth white screen with nothing behind it  a loudspeaker down the hall gave those
xylophone dings that meant god knows what all the time 
when joelle s head came back up  the reassuring little hills and valleys of veiled features reappeared behind the screen   i m
going to have to take off here in a second   she said   i could come on back after  if you want  i can bring anything you think you d
like  
gately hiked an eyebrow at her  to get her to smile 
 hopefully since your fever went down they said they ll decide you re out of the woods and take that out  finally   joelle said 

 looking at gately s mouth   it s got to hurt  and pat said you ll feel better when you can start quote sharing what you re feeling  
gately hiked both eyebrows 
 and you can tell me what you d like brought  who you d want to have come  whom  
moving his left arm north along his chest and throat to get the left hand up to feel at his mouth made the whole right side sing
with pain  a skin warmed plastic tube led in from the right side and was taped to his right cheek and went into his mouth and went
down his throat past where his fingers could feel at the back of his mouth  he hadn t been able to feel it in his mouth or going
down the back of his throat to he didn t want to know where  or even the tape on his cheek  he d had like this like tube in his
throat the whole time and hadn t even known it  it had been in there so long by the time he came up for air he d gotten like
unconsciously used to it and hadn t even known it was there  maybe it was a feeding tube  the tube was probably why he could
only mew and grunt  he probably didn t have permanent voice damage  thank god  he made his thoughts capitalized and
thanked god several times  he pictured himself at a lavish commitment podium  like at an aa convention  off handedly saying
something that got an enormous laugh 
either joelle had some sort of problem with her thumb or she d just got really interested in watching the thumb flex and
twiddle  she was saying  it s strange  not knowing it s coming  then standing up there to speak  folks you don t know  things i
don t realize i think til i say them  on the show i was used to knowing quite well what i thought before i spoke  this isn t like
that   she seemed to be addressing herself to the thumb   i took a page from your manual and shared my complaint about the  but
for the grace of god   and you were right  they just laughed  but i also     i hadn t realized til i found myself telling them that i d
stopped seeing the  one day at a time  and  keep it in the day  as trite cliches  patronizing   gately noticed she still talks about
recovery issues in a stiff proper intellectualish way she doesn t talk about other stuff with  her way of still keeping it all at arm s
length a little  a mental thumb to pretend to look at while she talks  it was all right  gately s own way of keeping it at arm s length
at the start had involved an actual arm  he pictured her laughing as he tells her that  the veil billowing mightily in and out  he
smiled around the tube  which joelle saw as encouragement  she said  and why pat in counselling keeps telling me just to build a
wall around each individual    hour period and not look over or back  and not to count days  even when you get a chip for   
days or    days  not to add them up  in counselling i d just smile and nod  being polite  but standing up there last night  i didn t
even share it aloud  but i realized suddenly that this was why i d never been able to stay off the stuff for more than a couple weeks 
i d always break down  go back  freebase   she looks up at him   i  based  you know  you knew that  you all see the intake forms  
gately smiles 
she said  this was why i couldn t get off and stay off  just as the cliche warns  i literally wasn t keeping it in the day  i was
adding the clean days up in my head   she cocked her head at him   did you ever hear of this fellow evel knievel  this
motorcycle jumper  
gately nods slightly  being careful of a tube he now feels  this is why his throat had had that raped feeling in it  the tube  he
actually has an old cutout action picture of the historical evel knievel  from an old life magazine  in a white leather elvisish suit 
in the air  aloft  haloed in spotlights  upright on a bike  a row of well waxed trucks below 
 at st  collie only the crocodiles d heard of him  my own daddy d followed him  cut out pictures  as a boy   gately can tell
she s smiling under there   but what i used to do  i d throw away the pipe and shake my fist at the sky and say as god is my
fucking witness never again  as of this minute right here i quit for all time   she also has this habit of absently patting
the top of her head when she talks  where little barrettes and spongy clamps hold the veil in place   and i d bunker up all whiteknuckled and stay straight  and count the days  i was proud of each day i stayed off  each day seemed evidence of something  and
i counted them  i d add them up  line them up end to end  you know   gately knows very well but doesn t nod  lets her do this on
just her own steam  she says  and soon it would get     improbable  as if each day was a car knievel had to clear  one car  two
cars  by the time i d get up to say like maybe about    cars  it would begin to seem like this staggering number  jumping over   
cars  and the rest of the year  looking ahead  hundreds and hundreds of cars  me in the air trying to clear them   she left her head
alone and cocked it   who could do it  how did i ever think anyone could do it that way  
gately remembered some evil fucking personal detoxes  broke in maiden  bent with pleurisy in salem  mci billerica during
a four day lockdown that caught him short  he remembered kicking the bird for weeks on the floor of a revere holding cell 
courtesy of the good old revere a d a  locked down tight  a bucket for a toilet  the holding cell hot but a terrible icy draft down
near the floor  cold turkey  abrupt withdrawal  the bird  being incapable of doing it and yet having to do it  locked in  a
revere holding cage for    days  feeling the edge of every second that went by  taking it a second at a time  drawing the time in
around him real tight  withdrawing  any one second  he remembered  the thought of feeling like he d be feeling this second for   
more of these seconds   he couldn t deal  he could not fucking deal  he had to build a wall around each second just to take it 
the whole first two weeks of it are telescoped in his memory down into like one second   less  the space between two heartbeats 
a breath and a second  the pause and gather between each cramp  an endless now stretching its gull wings out on either side of
his heartbeat  and he d never before or since felt so excruciatingly alive  living in the present between pulses  what the white
flaggers talk about  living completely in the moment  a whole day at a crack seemed like tit  when he came in  for he had
abided with the bird 
but this inter beat present  this sense of endless now   it had vanished in revere holding along with the heaves and chills 
he d returned to himself  moved to sit on the bunk s edge  and ceased to abide because he no longer had to 
his right side is past standing  but the hurt is nothing like the bird s hurt was  he wonders  sometimes  if that s what ferocious
francis and the rest want him to walk toward  abiding again between heartbeats  tries to imagine what kind of impossible leap it
would take to live that way all the time  by choice  straight  in the second  the now  walled and contained between slow
heartbeats  ferocious francis s own sponsor  the nearly dead guy they wheel to white flag and call sarge  says it all the time  it s
a gift  the now  it s aa s real gift  it s no accident they call it the present 
 and yet it wasn t til that poor new pipe fellow from home pointed at me and hauled me up there and i said it that i realized  
joelle said   i don t have to do it that way  i get to choose how to do it  and they ll help me stick to the choice  i don t think i d
realized before that i could   i can really do this  i can do this for one endless day  i can  don  
the look he was giving her was meant to like validate her breakthrough and say yes yes she could  she could as long as she

 continued to choose to  she was looking right at him  gately could tell  but he d also gotten a personal prickly chill all over from
his own thinking  he could do the dextral pain the same way  abiding  no one single instant of it was unendurable  here was a
second right here  he endured it  what was undealable with was the thought of all the instants all lined up and stretching ahead 
glittering  and the projected future fear of the a d a   whoever was out there in a hat eating third world fast food  the fear of
getting convicted of nuckslaugh ter  of v i p  suffocation  of a lifetime on the edge of his bunk in m c i  walpole  remembering 
it s too much to think about  to abide there  but none of it s as of now real  what s real is the tube and noxzema and pain  and
this could be done just like the old cold bird  he could just hunker down in the space between each heartbeat and make each
heartbeat a wall and live in there  not let his head look over  what s unendurable is what his own head could make of it all  what
his head could report to him  looking over and ahead and reporting  but he could choose not to listen  he could treat his head like
g  day or r  lenz  clueless noise  he hadn t quite gotten this before now  how it wasn t just the matter of riding out the cravings
for a substance  everything unendurable was in the head  was the head not abiding in the present but hopping the wall and doing
a recon and then returning with unendurable news you then somehow believed  if gately got out of this  he decided  he was going
to take the knievel picture off his wall and mount it and give it to joelle  and they d laugh  and she d call him don or the bimster 
etc 
gately rolls his eyes way over to the right to see joelle again  who she s using both pale hands to get the big book open on her
sweatpants  lap  gray windowlight shines on clear plastic sheets like little laminates inside the thing 
      idea to haul this out last night and was looking at it  i wanted to  show you my own personal daddy   she says  she s
holding the photo album out at him  wide open  like a kindergarten teacher at storytime  gately makes a production of squinting 
joelle comes over and rests the big album on the top of gately s crib railing  peering down over the top and pointing at a snapshot
in its little square sleeve 
 right there s my daddy   in front of a low white porch railing  a generic lean old guy with lines around his nose from
squinting into sunlight and the composed smile of somebody that s been told to smile  a skinny dog at his side  half in profile 
gately s more interested in how the shadow of whoever took the photo is canted into the shot s foreground  darkening half the dog 
 and that s one of the dogs  a pointer that got hit right after that by a ups truck out to       she says   where no animal with a
lick of sense would think it had business being  my daddy never names dogs  that one s just called the one that got hit by the
ups truck   her voice is different again 
gately tries to abide in seeing what she s pointing at  most of the rest of the page s pictures are of farm type animals behind
wooden fences  looking the way things look that can t smile  that don t know a camera s looking  joelle said her personal daddy
was a low ph chemist  but her late mother s own daddy had left them a farm  and joelle s daddy moved them out there and jickjacked around with farming  mostly as an excuse to keep lots of pets and stick experimental low ph stuff in the soil 
at some point in here an all business nurse comes in and fucks with the i v  bottles  then hunkers down and changes the
catheter receptacle under the bed  and for a second gately likes to die of embarrassment  joelle seems not even to be pretending
not to notice 
 and this right here s a bull we used to call mr  man   her slim thumb moves from shot to shot  the sunlight in kentucky
looks bright yellower than nne s  the trees are a meaner green and have got weird mossy shit hanging from them   and this right
here s a mule called chet that could jump the fence and used to get at everybody s flowers out along route    til daddy had to put
him down  this is a cow  this right here s chet s mama  it s a mare  i don t recollect any kind of name except  chet s mama  
daddy d let her out to neighbors that really did farm  to sort of make up for folks  flowers  
gately nods studiously at each photo  trying to abide  he hasn t thought about the wraith or the wraith dream once since he
woke up from the dream where joelle was mrs  waite as a maternal death figure  next life s chet s mama  he opens his eyes
wide to clear his head  joelle s head is down  looking down at the open album from overhead  her veil hangs loose and blank
again  so close he could reach his left hand up and lift it if he wanted  the open book she s moving her hand around in gives
gately an idea he can t believe he s only having now  except he worries because he isn t left handed  which is to say sinistral 
joelle s got her thumb by a weird old sepia shot of the ass and hunched back of some guy scrabbling up the slope of a roof   uncle
lum   she says   mr  riney  lum riney  my daddy s partner over to the shop  that breathed some kind of fume at the shop when i
was little  and got strange  and now he ll always try and climb up on top of shit  if you let him  
he winces at the pain of moving his left arm to put a hand on her wrist to get her attention  her wrist is thin across the top but
oddly deep  thick seeming  gately gets her to look at him and takes the hand off her wrist and uses it to mime writing awkwardly
in the air  his eyes rolling a bit from the pain of it  this is his idea  he points at her and then out the window and circles his hand
back to her  he refuses to grunt or moo to emphasize anything  his forefinger is twice the size of her thumb as he again mimes
holding an implement and writing on the air  he makes such a big slow obvious show of it because he can t see her eyes to be sure
she gets what he s after 
if a halfway attractive female so much as smiles at don gately as they pass on the crowded street  don gately  like pretty
much all heterosexual drug addicts  has within a couple blocks mentally wooed  shacked up with  married and had kids by that
female  all in the future  all in his head  mentally dandling a young gately on his mutton joint knee while this mental mrs  g 
bustles in an apron she sometimes at night provocatively wears with nothing underneath  by the time he gets where he s going  the
drug addict has either mentally divorced the female and is in a bitter custody battle for the kids or is mentally happily still hooked
up with her in his sunset years  sitting together amid big headed grandkids on a special porch swing modified for gately s mass 
her legs in support hose and orthopedic shoes still damn fine  barely having to speak to converse  calling each other  mother  and
 papa   knowing they ll kick within weeks of each other because neither could possibly live without the other  is how bonded
they ve got through the years 
the projective mental union of gately and joelle   m p    van dyne keeps foundering on the vision of gately knee dandling a
kid in a huge blue  or pink bordered veil  however  or tenderly removing the spongy clamps of joelle s veil in moonlight on their
honeymoon in atlantic city and discovering just like one eye in the middle of her forehead or a horrific churchill face or
something        so the addictive mental long range fantasy gets shaky  but he still can t help envisioning the old x  with joelle
well veiled and crying out and lo  in that empty compelling way at the moment of orchasm   the closest gately d ever come to

 xing a celebrity was the ragingly addicted nursing student with the head banging loft  who d borne an incredible resemblance to
the young dean martin  having joelle share personal historical snapshots with gately leads his mind right over the second s wall
to envision joelle  hopelessly smitten with the heroic don g   volunteering to bonk the guy in the hat outside the room over the
head and sneak gately and his tube and catheter out of st  e  s in a laundry cart or whatever  saving him from the bpd finest or
federal crew cuts or whatever direr legal retribution the guy in the hat might represent  or else selflessly offering to give him her
veil and a big dress and let him hold the catheter under the muumuu and sashay right out while she huddles under the covers in
impersonation of gately  romantically endangering her recovery and radio career and legal freedom  all out of a liebestod type
consuming love for gately 
this last fantasy makes him ashamed  it s so cowardly  and even contemplating a romantic thing with a clueless newcomer is
shameful  in boston aa  newcomer seducing is called i th stepping       and is regarded as the province of true bottomfeeders  it s predation  newcomers come in so whacked out  clueless and scared  their nervous systems still on the outside of their
bodies and throbbing from detox  and so desperate to escape their own interior  to lay responsibility for themselves at the feet of
something as seductive and consuming as their former friend the substance  to avoid the mirror aa hauls out in front of them  to
avoid acknowledging their old dear friend the substance s betrayal  and grieving it  plus let s not even mention the mirror andvulnerability issues of a newcomer that has to wear a u h i d veil  one of boston aa s stronger suggestions is that newcomers
avoid all romantic relationships for at least a year  so somebody with some sober time predating and trying to seduce a newcomer
is almost tantamount to rape  is the boston consensus  not that it isn t done  but the ones that do it never have the kind of sobriety
anybody else respects or wants for themselves  a i th stepper is still running from the mirror himself 
not to mention that a staffer seducing a new resident he s supposed to be there to help would be dicking over pat montesian
and ennet house on a grand scale 
gately sees it s probably no accident that his vividest joelle fantasies are coincident with flight from finest and legalresponsibility fantasies  that his head s real fantasy is this newcomer helping him avoid  escape  and run  joining him later in like
kentucky on a modified porch swing  he s still pretty new himself  wanting somebody else to take care of his mess  somebody
else to keep him out of his various cages  it s the same delusion as the basic addictive substance delusion  basically  his eyes roll
up in his head at disgust with himself  and stay there 
i went down the hall to take out the tobacco and brush my teeth and rinse out the spiru tein can  which had gotten an
unpleasant crust along the sides  the subdorm halls were curved and had no corners as such  but you can see at most three doors
and the jamb of the fourth from any point in the hall before the curve extrudes into your line of sight  i wondered briefly whether
it was true that small children believed their parents could see them even around corners and curves 
the high wind s moan and doors  rattle were worse in the uncarpeted hall  i could hear faint sounds of early morning weeping
in certain rooms beyond my line of sight  lots of the top players start the a m  with a quick fit of crying  then are basically hale
and well wrapped for the rest of the day 
the walls of the subdorms  hallways are dinner mint blue  the walls of the rooms themselves are cream  all the woodwork is
dark and varnished  as is the guilloche that runs below all e t a  ceilings  and the dominant odor in the hallways is always a
mixture of varnish and tincture of benzoin 
someone had left a window open by the sinks in the boys  room  and a hump of snow lay on the sill  and on the floor beneath
the window by the sink on the end  whose hot water pipe shrieks  was a parabolic dusting of snow  already melting at the apex  i
turned on the lights and the exhaust fan kicked on with them  for some reason i could barely stand its sound  when i put my head
out the window the wind came from nowhere and everywhere  the snow swirling in funnels and eddies  and there were little grains
of ice in the snow  it was brutally cold  across the east courts  the paths were obscured  and the pine s branches were near
horizontal under their snow s weight  schtitt s transom and observation tower looked menacing  it was still dark and snow free on
the lee side facing comm  ad  the sight of distant athscme fans displacing great volumes of snowy air northward is one of the
better winter views from our hilltop  but visibility was now too poor to make out the fans  and the liquid hiss of the snow was too
total to make out whether the fans were even on  the headmaster s house wasn t much more than a humped shape off by the north
tree line  but i could picture poor c t  at the living room window in leather slippers and scotch plaid robe  seeming to pace even
when standing still  raising and lowering the antenna of the phone in his hand  with several calls out already to logan  m i a dorval  weathernet  ooo s recorded update  heavy browed figures in quebec s o n a n t a  office  c t  s forehead a washboard and lips moving soundless as he brainstormed his way toward a state of total worry 
i brought my head back in when i could no longer feel my face  i made my little ablutions  i hadn t had to go to the bathroom
in a serious way in three days

when the whap whap of the bathroom door subsided i heard a quiet voice with an odd tone farther up around the curve of the
hallway  it turned out that good old ortho stice was sitting in a bedroom chair in front of a hall window  he was facing the
window  the window was closed  and he had his forehead up against the glass  either talking or chanting to himself very quietly 
the whole lower part of the window was fogged with his breath  i came up behind him  listening  the back of his head was that
shark belly gray white of crew cuts so short the scalp shows through  i was more or less right behind his chair  i couldn t tell
whether he was talking to himself or chanting something  he didn t turn around even when i rattled my toothbrush in the nasa
glass  he had on his classic darknesswear  black sweatshirt  black sweatpants on which he d had a red and gray e t a 
silkscreened down both legs  his feet were bare on the cold floor  i was standing right beside the chair  and he still didn t look up 
 who s that now   he said  staring straight ahead through the window 
 hi orth  
 hal  you re up kind of early  
i rattled my toothbrush a little to indicate a shrug   you know  up and about  
 what s the matter  
 what do you mean   i asked 
 your voice  shoot  are you crying  what s the matter  

 my voice had been neutral and a bit puzzled   i m not crying  orth  
 well then   stice breathed onto the window  he reached up without moving his head and scratched the back of his crew cut 
 up and around  we going to play some furriners out there today or what  
for the past ten days i d always felt worst in the early a m   before dawn  there s something elementally horrific about waking
before dawn  the window was unobscured above the darkness s breath line  the snow wasn t swirling or pummelling the
window as much on the building s east side  but the lee side s absence of wind showed just how hard new snow was coming down 
it was like a white curtain endlessly descending  the sky was lightening here on the east side  a paler gray white  not unlike
stice s crew cut  i realized that from his position he could see only condensed breath on the window  no reflections  i made a few
grotesque  distended  pop eyed faces at him behind his back  they made me feel worse 
i rattled the brush   well  if we do  it s not going to be out there  it s drifting about up to the tape on the west nets  they ll have
to try to get us indoors somewhere  
stice breathed   there s no indoor place s got thirty six courts  inc  winchester club s got twelve is maybe the most  fucking
mount auburn s only got eight  
 they ll have to move us around to different sites  it s a pain in the ass  but schtitt s done it before  i think the real variable   
be whether the quebec kids got into logan last night before whenever it was this hit  
 logan ll be shut down you re saying  
 but i think we d have heard if they got in last night  freer and struck were keeping tabs on an f a a  link ever since supper 
mario said  
 boys are looking to get x d by some slow witted hairy legged foreign girls or what  
 my guess is they re stuck up at dorval  i ll bet c t  is on the case even now  get some sort of announcement at breakfast 
probably  
this was a clear opening for the darkness to do a quick c t  impression  wondering aloud over the phone to the quebecois
coach whether he  c t   should press for them to charter ground transport from montreal or else rather urge them not to risk travel
through the concavity in a storm in such a generous but disappointed gesture the quebecois would think busing the     clicks to
boston in a blizzard was his own generous idea  c t  wholly open  opening all different psych strategies to the coach s inspection 
with the frantic ruffling sound of the coach s french english dictionary loud in the phone s background  but stice just sat there
with his forehead against the glass  his bare feet were tapping some sort of rhythm on the floor  the hallway was freezing  and his
toes had a faint blue tinge  he blew air out of his lips in a tight sigh  making his fat cheeks flap a little  we called this his horsesound 
 were you talking to yourself out here  or chanting  or what  
a silence ensued 
 heard this one joke   stice said finally 
 let s hear it  
 you want to hear it  
 i could use a quality laugh right now  dark   i said 
 you too  
another silence ensued  two different people were weeping at different pitches behind closed doors  a toilet flushed on the
second floor  one of the weepers was nearly skirling  an inhuman keening sound  there was no way to tell which e t a  male it
was  which door back down past the walls  curve 
the darkness scratched the back of his head again without moving his head  his hands looked almost luminous against the
black sleeves 
 there s these three statisticians gone duck hunting   he said  he paused   they re like statisticians by trade  
 i m with you so far  
 and they gone off hunting duck  and they re hunkered down in the muck of a duck blind  for hunting  in waders and hats and
all  your top of the line winchester double aughts  so on  and they re quacking into one of them kazoos duck hunters always
quack into  
 duck calls   i said 
 there you go   stice tried to nod against the window   well and here comes this one duck come flying on by overhead  
 their quarry  the object of their being out there  
 damn straight  their raisin debt and what have you  and they re getting set to blast the son of a whore into feathers and goo  
stice said   and the first statistician  he brings up his winnie and lets go  and the recoil goes and knocks him back on his ass
kersplat in the muck  and but he s missed the duck  just low  they saw  and so the second statistician he up and fires then  and
back he goes too on his ass too  these winnies got a fucker of a recoil on them  and back on his ass the second one goes  from
firing  and they see his shot goes just high  
 misses the duck as well  
 misses her just high  at which and then the third statistician commences to whooping and jumping up and down to beat the
band  hollering  we got him  boys  we done got him   
someone was crying out in a bad dream and someone else was yelling for quiet  i wasn t even pretending to laugh  stice
didn t seem to expect me to  he shrugged without moving his head  his forehead had not once left the cold glass 
i stood next to him in silence and held my nasa glass with the toothbrush and looked out over the top of stice s head
through the window s upper half  the snowfall was intense and looked silky  the east courts  pavilion s green canvas roof bowed
ominously down  its white gator ade logo obscured  a figure was out there  not under the shelter of the pavilion but sitting in
the bleachers behind the east show courts  leaning back with his elbows on one level and bottom on the next and feet stretched
out below  not moving  wearing what seemed to be puffy and bright enough to be a coat  but getting buried by snow  just sitting
there  it was impossible to tell the person s age or sex  church spires off in brookline were darkening as the sky lightened behind
them  the beginning of dawn looked like moonlight through the snow  several people were at their vehicles  windshields with

 scrapers down along commonwealth avenue  their images were tiny and dark and fluttered  the avenue s line of buried parked
cars looked like igloo after igloo  some sort of eskimo tract housing thing  it had never before snowed like this in mid november 
a snow covered b train labored uphill like a white slug  it seemed clear that the t would be suspending routes before long  the
snow and cold sunrise gave everything a confected quality  the portcullis between the driveway and the parking lot was half up 
probably to keep it from being frozen closed  i couldn t see who was in the portcullis s security booth  the attendants always came
and went  most of them from the ennet house place  trying to  recover   the flagpole s two flags were frozen and stuck right out
straight  turning stiffly from side to side in the wind  like someone in a neck brace  instead of flapping  the e t a  physical post
mailbox just inside the portcullis had a mo hawk of snow  the whole scene had an indescribable pathos to it  slice s fogged breath
kept me from seeing anything closer than the mailbox and east courts  the light was starting to diffract into colors at the
perimeter of slice s breath fog on the window 
 schacht heard that joke down at the cranial place from some b u  fellow with just terrible facial pain  he said   stice said 
tm going to go ahead and ask the question  d man  
 it s a statistics joke  you got to know your medials means and modes  
 i get the joke  orth  the question is how come you ve got your forehead all up against the window like that when your
breath s keeping you from seeing anything  what are you trying to look at  and isn t your forehead getting kind of cold  
stice didn t nod  he made his horse sound again  he had always had the face of a fat man on a fit man s lean body  i hadn t
noticed before that he had an odd little teardrop of extra flesh low down on his right jowl  like a bit of skin with mole aspirations 
he said  the forehead stopped feeling cold a couple hours back  when i lost all my feeling in it  
 you ve been sitting here with bare feet and your forehead against the glass for a couple hours  
 more like four  i think  
i could hear a night custodial crew laughing and clanking a bucket right below us  only one was laughing  it was kenkle and
brandt 
 my next question s pretty obvious  then  orth  
he gave another awkward shrug that didn t involve his head   well  it s sort of embarrassing  here  inc   he said  he paused 
 it s stuck is what it is  
 your forehead s stuck to the window  
 best as i can recollect i wake up  it s just after       fuckin coyle s having them discharges again and there s no sleeping
through that  boy  
 i shudder to think  orth  
 and coyle  course just doesn t even hit the light just hauls out a fresh sheet from the stack under his bunk and goes right back
to sawing logs  and i m wide awake by this point in time  though  and then i couldn t get back under  
 couldn t get back to sleep  
 something s real wrong  i can tell   the darkness said   pre fundraiser nerves  the whataburger coming up  you feel
yourself starting to climb plateaux  starting to play the way you came here hoping one day to play  and part of you doesn t believe
it  it feels wrong  i went through this  believe me  i can und  
stice automatically tried to shake his head and then gave a small cry of pain   not that  none of that  long fucking story  i m
not even sure i d want anybody to believe it  forget that part  the point s i m up there   i m lying there real sweaty and hot and
jittered  i jump on down and got a chair and brang it out here to set where it s cool  
 and where you don t have to lie there and contemplate coyle s sheet slowly ripening under his bunk   i said  shuddering a
little 
 and it s just starting to snow  then  out  it s about maybe like       i thought how i d just set and watch the snow a little and
settle on down and then go grab some sack down in the v r   he scratched at the reddening back of his scalp again 
 and as you watched  you rested your head pensively against the glass for just a second  
 and that was all she wrote  forgot the forehead was sweated up  whammo  kertwanged my own self  just like remember
when rader and them got ingersoll to touch his tongue on that net post last new year s  stuck here fucking tight as that tongue 
hal  hell of a lot more total stuck area  too  than ingersoll  he only did lose that smidgeon off the tip  inc  i tried to pull her off her
about       and there was this fucking       sound  this sound and a feeling like the skin ll give before the bind will  sure  frozen
stuck  and this here s more skin than i care to say goodbye to  buddy ruff   he was speaking just above a whisper 
 jesus  and you ve just been sitting here all this time  
 well shit i was embarrassed  and it never got quite bad enough to yell out  i kept thinking if it gets a little worse i ll go on
and yell out  and then along about    i quit feeling the forehead altogether  
 you ve just been sitting here waiting for someone to happen along  chanting quietly to keep up your courage  
 i was just praying like hell it wouldn t be pemulis  god only knows what that son of a whore d ve thunk of to do to me here
all helpless and immobi lated  and troeltsch is sawing logs just inside that door there  with his fucking mike and cable and
ambitions  i ve been praying he don t wake up  and let s don t even mention that son of a bitch freer  
i looked at the door   but that s axhandle s single  what would troeltsch be doing sleeping in axhandle s room  
ortho shrugged   trust that i ve had plenty of time to listen and identify different folks  snores  inc  
i looked from stice to axford s door and back   so you ve just been sitting here listening to sleep noises and watching your
breath expand and freeze on the window   i said  imagining it seemed somehow unendurable  me just sitting there  stuck  well
before sunrise  alone  too embarrassed to call out  my own exhalations fouling the window and denying me even a view to divert
attention from the horror  i stood there horrified  admiring the darkness s ballsy calm 
 there was a kind of real bad half hour when my upper lip up and got stuck too  in the breath  when the breath froze  but i
breathed the sucker loose  i breathed real hot and fast  goddamn near hyper v d  i was scared if i passed out i d slump on forward
and the whole face d get stuck  goddamn forehead s bad enough  
i put my toothbrush and nasa glass down on the cantilevered vent module  rooms  vents were recessed  hallway vents
protrusive  e t a  s annular heating system produced a lubricated hum i had stopped really hearing years ago  the headmaster s

 house still had oil heat  it always sounded like a maniac was hammering at the pipes far below 
 dark  prepare yourself mentally   i said   i m going to help pull you loose  
stice didn t seem to hear this  he seemed oddly preoccupied for a man occlusively sealed to a frozen window  he was feeling
at the back of his head with real vigor  which is what he did when he was preoccupied   you believe in shit  hal  
 shit  
 i don t know  little kid shit  telekiniption  ghosts  parabnormal shit  
 just going to get around behind you and yank and we ll pop you right off   i said 
 somebody did come by before   he said   there was somebody standing back there about maybe an hour back  but he just
stood there  then he went away  or     it   a full body shiver 
 it ll be like that last little bit of ankle tape  we ll pull you back so hard and fast you won t feel a thing  
 i m getting these real unpleasant memories of that piece of ingersolps tongue on nine s net post that stayed there til spring  
 this is no saliva and subzero metal situation  dark  this is some freakish occlusive seal  glass doesn t conduct heat like
metal conducts heat  
 there ain t too fucking much heat involved in this window right here  buddy ruff  
 and i m not sure what you mean  paranormal  i believed in vampires when i was small  himself allegedly used to see his
father s ghost on stairways sometimes  but then again toward the end he used to see black widow spiders in his hair  too  and
claimed i wasn t speaking sometimes when i was sitting right there speaking to him  so we kind of wrote it all off  orth  i guess i
don t know what to think about paranormal shit  
then plus i think something bit me  on the back of the head here  some bug that knew i was helpless and couldn t see   stice
dug again at the red area behind his ear  there was a kind of weltish bump there  it wasn t in a vampire related area of the neck 
 and good old mario says he s seen paranormal figures  and he s not kidding  and mario doesn t lie   i said   so belief wise i
don t know what to think  subhadronic particles behave ghostishly  i think i withhold all pre judgment on the whole thing  
 well all right then  it was good it was you come by then  
 the big thing s going to be to stiffen the old neck  dark  to avoid whiplash  we ll pull you off there like a cork from a bottle
of moet  
 pull my sorry ass off here  inc  and i ll take and show you some parab normal shit that ll shake your personal tree but good  
stice said  bracing   n t said nothing to nobody but lyle about it  and i m sick of the secretness of it  you won t pre formulize any
judgments  inc  i know  
 you re going to be fine   i said  i got right behind stice and bent slightly and got an arm around his chest  his wooden chair
creaked as i braced my knee against it  stice began breathing fast and hard  his parotitic jowls flapped a little as he breathed  our
cheeks were almost pressed together  i told him i was going to pull on the count of three  i actually pulled on two  so he couldn t
brace himself  i pulled back as hard as i could  and after a stutter of resistance stice pulled back with me 
there was a horrible sound  the skin of his forehead distended as we yanked his head back  it stretched and distended until a
sort of shelf of stretched forehead flesh half a meter long extended from his head to the window  the sound was like some sort of
elastic from hell  the dermis of slice s forehead was still stuck fast  but the abundant loose flesh of stice s bulldog face had risen
and gathered to stretch and connect his head to the window  and for a second i saw what might be considered stice s real face  his
features as they would be if not encased in loose jowly prairie flesh  as every mm  of spare flesh was pulled up to his forehead and
stretched  i got a glimpse of stice as he would appear after a radical face lift  a narrow  fine featured  and slightly rodential face 
aflame with some sort of revelation  looked out at the window from beneath the pink visor of stretched spare skin 
all this took place in less than second  for just an instant we both stayed there  straining backward  listening to the little ricekrispie sound of his skin s collagen bundles stretching and popping  his chair was leaning way back on its two rear legs  then
stice shrieked in pain   jesus god put it back   the little second face s blue eyes protruded like cartoon eyes  the fine little thinlipped second mouth was a round coin of pain and fear 
 put it back put it back put it back   stice yelled 
i couldn t just let go  though  for fear that the elastic stretch would snap stice forward into the window and send his face
through the glass  i eased him forward  watching the chair s front legs descend slowly to the floor  and the tension of the
forehead s skin decreased  and slice s full fleshy round face reappeared over the small second face  and covered it  and we eased
him forward until nothing but a few centimeters of decollagenated forehead skin hanging and sagging at about eyelash level
remained as evidence of the horrific stretch 
 jesus god   stice panted 
 you are really and truly stuck  orth  
 fuck me skating did that ever hurt  
i tried to rotate a kink out of my shoulder   we re going to have to thaw it off  dark  
 you re not getting close to this forehead with a saw  bud  i ll set right cheer till spring first  see if i don t  
then jim troeltsch s towering a m  cowlick and then face and fist emerged through axford s doorway just over stice s
hunched shoulder  stice had been right  being in somebody else s room even after lights out was an infraction  staying there
overnight was too far out even to mention in the regulations   reports of screaming have reached us here in the eyewitness newscenter   troeltsch said into his fist 
 the fuck out of here  troeltsch   stice said 
 thaw  ortho  warm water  heat the window  hot water  dissolve the adhesion  heating pad  hot pack from loach s office or
something  
 loach s door can t be dickied   stice said   don t wake him up on fundraiser day yet  
troeltsch extended the fist   reports of high pitched screams have led this reporter to an unfolding scene of dramatic crisis 
and we re going to attempt to get a word with the youngster at the center of all the commotion  
 tell him to pipe down and get back with that hand or so help me jesus  hal  
 the darkness accidentally put his forehead against the window here when it was wet and it froze and he s been out here stuck

 all night   i told troeltsch  ignoring the big fist he held to my face  i squeezed stice s shoulder   i ll go get brandt to rig something
warm  
it was as if some tacit agreement had been reached not even to bring up troeltsch s being in axford s room or where axford
was  it was hard to know which would be more disturbing  axford s not being in his room all night or axford being in there
behind the ajar door  meaning troeltsch and axford had both spent the night in one small single with exactly one bed  the
universe seemed to have aligned itself so that even acknowledging it would violate some tacit law  troeltsch seemed oblivious to
any appearance of impropriety or unthinkable possibilities  it was hard to imagine he d be this obnoxious if he felt he had
something to be discreet about  he was standing on tiptoe to see over the window s breath line  one hand cupped over his ear as if
to hold a headset  he whistled softly   plus in addition now reports of mind boggling snowfall are coming in to the news center  
i grabbed my toothbrush and nasa glass from the vent s protrusion  since the betel caper        only the worst kind of naif
leaves his toothbrush unattended around e t a   keep an eye on stice and my nasa glass right there  jim  if you would  
 any comment on the mixture of pain  cold  embarrassment  and weather related feelings you must be feeling  mr  stice is it  
 don t leave me immobilated with troeltsch  man  hal  he s going to make me talk to his hand  
 a weather related drama unfolding around the original plight of an embarrassed man trapped by his own forehead   troeltsch
was saying into his fist  facing his own reflection in the window  trying with the other big hand to quash the cowlick  as i trotted
and slid to a stop in my socks just past the door to the stairwell 
kenkle and brandt were ageless in the special desiccated way janitors are ageless  somewhere between thirty five and sixty 
they were inseparable and essentially unemployable  boredom had years ago led us to lateral alice moore s minimally cryptoprotected employee files  and brandt s file had listed his s  b  i q  as submoronic to moronic  he was bald and somehow at once
overweight and wiry  both right and left temples carried red jagged surgical scars of unknown origin  his affective range
consisted of different intensities of grin  he lived with kenkle in an attic apartment in roxbury crossing overlooking madison
park high school s locked and cordoned playground  famed site of unsolved ritual mutilations in the year of the perdue
wonderchicken  his major attraction for kenkle seemed to consist in the fact that he neither walked away nor interrupted when
kenkle was speaking  even in the stairwell i could hear kenkle discoursing on their thanksgiving plans and directing brandt s
mop work  kenkle was technically black  as in negroid  though he was more the burnt sienna color of a spoiled pumpkin  but his
hair was a black person s hair  and he wore it in thick dreadlocks that looked like a crown of wet cigars  an academic diamond in
the very rough roxbury crossing  he d received his doctorate in low temperature physics from u mass  at twenty one and taken a
prestigious sinecure at the u s  office of naval research  then at twenty three had been court martialed out of the o n r  for
offenses that changed each time you asked him  some event between twenty one and twenty three seemed to have broken him at
several strategic points  and he d retreated from bethesda back to the front stoop of his old roxbury crossing apartment building 
where he read ba hai texts whose jackets he covered with intricately folded newspaper  and spat spectacular parabolas of
quivering phlegm into new dudley street  he was dark freckled and carbuncular and afflicted with excess phlegm  he was an
incredible spitter  and alleged his missing incisors had been removed  for facilitating the expec toratory process   we all suspected
he was either hypomanic or  drine addicted or both  his expression was very serious at all times  he discoursed nonstop to poor
brandt  using spit as a sort of conjunction between clauses  he spoke loudly because they both wore earplugs of expanding foam
  people s nightmare cries gave them the fantods  their custodial technique consisted of kenkle spitting with pinpoint accuracy
onto whatever surface brandt was to clean next and brandt trotting like a fine hunting dog from glob to glob  listening and
grinning  laughing when appropriate  they were moving away from me down the hall toward the second floor s east window 
brandt making great shining arcs with his doh s head mop  kenkle pulling the gunmetal bucket and lobbing signifying phlegm
over brandt s bent back 
 and then the yuletide season  brandt my friend brandt   christmas   christmas morning   what is the essence of
christmas morning but the childish co eval of venereal interface  for a child    a present  brandt   something you have not
earned and which formerly was out of your possession is now in your po ssession   can you sit there and try to say there is no
symbolic rela tion between unwrapping a christmas present and undressing a young lady  
brandt bobbed and mopped  uncertain whether to laugh 
himself had met kenkle and brandt on the t  kenkle and brandt apparently rode the t at night  recreationally   trying
somehow to make it up to enfield from the back bay via the orange line        and somewhat the worse for wear  kenkle and
brandt not only got himself onto the right color train and kept him propped up between them all the way up the eternity of
comm  ave   they d seen him safely down the t stop s steep iron stairs and across traffic and up the hill s serpentine driveway to
the portcullis  and had been invited in at      by himself to continue whatever low temperature discussion he and kenkle had
been having as brandt carried himself up the hill in a fireman s carry  kenkle recalls that night s discussion being about the
human nose as an erectile organ  but the only really sure bet is that it was one sided   and the duo had ended up being cast as
black veiled noh style attendants in himself s zero gravity tea ceremony  and had been menially employed at e t a  ever
since  though always on the graveyard shift  since mr  harde loathed kenkle with a passion 
kenkle hawked and hit a small strip of dust at the crease of baseboard and floor that the mop s arc had missed   for i am a
missionary man  brandt  is what i am   brandt   as in give me the straight forward venereal in terface of missionary congress
or give me nihil and zilch   you know what i am saying    give me your best thoughts on alter native positions  brandt  
brandt   for me  for my part at least  i say nix and nihil on the rear entry or you might hear it termed dog  or canine style
interface so favored in huts  blue car tridges  tan tric etchings   brandt  it s animal istic   why    why you say    brandt  it
is an ess entially hunched way to have interface   she hunches  you hunch over her   in ordinately too much hunching  to my
own way of  
it was brandt who heard me as i came up behind them in socks  trying to keep to the drier patches  i almost slipped twice  it
was still coming down hard outside the east window 
 otto brandt here   brandt called to me  extending a hand  though i was still several meters away 
kenkle s dreadlocks protruded from under a plaid hat  he turned with brandt and raised his hand indianishly in greeting 
 good prince hal  up and dressed in dawn s ear a ly  

  let me introduce myself   brandt said  i shook his hand 
 in his socks and toothbrush  e t a  s athe ling  brandt  whom i will wager rar e ly hunches  
 the darkness needs you guys upstairs asap   i said  trying to dry a sock against a pant leg   dark s face is stuck to the
window and he s in terrible pain and we couldn t pull it off and it s going to take hot water  but not too hot   i indicated the bucket
at kenkle s feet  i noticed kenkle s shoes didn t match 
 what may we ask is so amusing  then   kenkle asked 
 name s brandt and pleased to meet you   brandt said  out with the hand again  he dropped the mop where kenkle pointed 
 troeltsch is with him now  but he s in a bad way   i said  shaking brandt s hand 
 we are in route   kenkle said   but why the hilarity  
 what hilarity  
kenkle looked from me to brandt to me   what hilarity he says  your face is a hilarity face  it s working hilariously  at first it
merely looked a mused  now it is open ly cach inated  you are almost doubled over  you can barely get your words out  you re
all but slapping your knee  that hilarity  good prince atheling hal  i thought all you players were compadre mundos in civilian
life  
brandt beamed as he backed down the hall  kenkle pushed his plaid cap back to scratch at some sort of eruption at the
hairline  i drew myself up to full height and consciously composed my face into something deadly somber   how about now  
brandt had the custodial closet unlocked  there was the sound of a metal bucket being filled at the closet s industrial tap 
kenkle brought his cap back forward and narrowed his eyes at me  he came up close  his eyelashes were clotted with small
crisp yellow flakes  there were struck like facial cysts in various stages of development  kenkle s breath always smelled vaguely
of egg salad  he felt at his mouth speculatively for a moment and said  somewheres now between amused and cach inated  mirthful  perhaps  the crinkled eyes  the dimples of mirth  the exposed gums  we can bounce this off brandt s best thinking as well 
if  
from directly overhead came a ceiling rattling  gyaaaaaaa  from stice  i was feeling at my face  some doors opened
along the hall  heads protruding  brandt had a full metal bucket and was trying to run to the stairwell  the weight of the bucket
canting his shoulder and steaming water sloshing onto the clean floor  he stopped with his hand on the stairwell door and looked
back over his shoulder at us  reluctant to proceed without kenkle 
 i elect to go with mirthful   kenkle said  giving my shoulder a little squeeze as he stepped past  i heard him saying different
things to the heads in the doorways all the way down the hall 
 jesus   i said  socks or no  i went forward into the really wet mopped area and tried to make out my face s expression in the
east window  it was now too light  though  outside  off all the snow  i looked sketchy and faint to myself  tentative and ghostly
against all that blazing white

mr  yee  like an extra dimension out there  less an element than its own dimension 
someone   shoe makes a squelching noise under the table  
mr  yee  with its own rules  laws  awe inspiring  fearsome 
mr  veals  cold  wet  deep  slippery  more like 
mr  tine jr    tapping the edge of a ruler against the tabletop   their limo in from logan did a     on storrow  mr  yee was
just telling  
mr  tine sr    tapping a telescoping weatherman s pointer against the edge of the tabletop   so what s the poop  the skinny 
what are we talking 
ms  hooley  spot ready for previewing  we need your go  i m in from phoenix via new new york 
mr  yee  i m in from ohio  choppered up from nny with mo here 
ms  hooley  spot s master s in the post production lab down at v v  all ready except for some final bugs with the matteing 
mr  veals  maureen says we need you and buster s green light to disseminate 
ms  hooley  you and the titular sponsor here green light it  we can have disseminatable product by the end of the weekend 
mr  veals   sneezes   assuming this fucking snow doesn t shut down our power 

 mr  tine sr    motioning with weatherman s pointer to u s o  stenographer to transcribe verbatim   seen it yet  buster 
mr  yee  negative  rod  just in with these folks here  kennedy completely socked in  mo had to charter a chopper  i m sitting
here cherry 
mr  tine jr    tapping edge of ruler on tabletop   how d you fare getting up here  sir  if i may 
mr  tine sr   mountain comes to mohammed  eh tom 
mr  veals  how come i only came two clicks down here and i m the one with a fucking cold 
mr  tine jr   i ve been here in boston as well 
mr  veals   checking connections on infernatron     y digital player and viewer system   so shall we 
mr  tine sr   ok  for the record  mo  demographic target 
ms  hooley  ages six to ten  with marginally reduced efficacy four to six and ten to thirteen  let s say target s four to
twelve  white  native english speaking  median income and above  capacity on kruger abstraction scale three or above   refers
to notes   advertable attention span of sixteen seconds with a geometric fall off commencing at thirteen seconds 
mr  tine sr   spot length 
ms  hooley  thirty seconds with a traumatic graphic at fourteen seconds 
mr  veals   hawks phlegm  
mr  yee  proposed insertion vehicle  mo 
ms  hooley  the  mr  bouncety bounce show   spontaneous dissemination at      m to f       central and mountain 
cream of the crop     share on spontaneous receptions for the slot 
mr  yee  any data on what percentage of total viewing in the slot is spontaneous versus recorded cartridge 
ms  hooley  we had     plus or minus two as of year of the yushityu       that s the last year the data s firmed up for 
mr  tine sr   so say     of total viewing for the spot 
mr  yee  give or take  impressive 
mr  tine sr   so check  check  check  we got rough costs 
mr  yee  production just over half a meg  post production  
mr  veals  bupkus     k before matteing 
mr  yee  i might add that tom s pro bonoing his part of the production 
mr  veals  so you all ready to eyeball this or what 
ms  hooley  since  mr  b b   s contracted as a no public service spot vehicle  dissemination charge    come out around   
ok per slot 
mr  yee  which we re still of the position this seems a bit steep 
mr  tine jr   the upcoming year s glad s year  buster  you wanted the year  you want the year of glad to be the year half the
nation stopped doing anything but staring bug eyed at some sinister cartridge while little whorls went around in their eyes until
they died of starvation in the middle of their own exc  
mr  tine sr   shut up  rodney  and quit with the ruler tapping  buster i m sure knows the incredible good will that s even now
accruing from their proud sponsorship of probably the most important public service spots ever conceived  given the potential
threat here 
mr  veals   sneezes twice in abrupt succession    comment unintelligible  
mr  tine sr    taps telescoping weatherman s pointer on edge of table top   righto then  the spot itself  then  the spokesfigure
icon thing  still the singing kleenex 
mr  yee  the what was it  frankie the no thankee hankie  warning kids to say no thankee to unlabelled or suspicious
cartridges 
ms  hooley   clears throat   tom 
mr  tine jr    taps ruler on edge of tabletop  
mr  veals   hawks   no  had to shit can the dancing kleenex after the response groups  test data were analyzed  various
problems  the phrase  no thankee  itself perceived as archaic  uncool  crotchety adult  too new england or something 
summoned images of a leathery faced old guy in overalls  took attention away from what they re supposed to say no thanks to 
plus phrase recognition data was way under minimum slogan parameters 
ms  hooley  problems with the icon itself 
mr  veals   blowing nose one nostril at a time   kids hated frankie the hankie  we re talking levels past ambivalence 
associated the hankie with snot  basically  the word booger kept coming up  the singing didn t help 
ms  hooley  which is why in this case thank god for response group testing 
mr  yee  this business ll make you old 
mr  veals  had to go back and completely reboot at square one 
mr  yee  does anyone else smell a peculiar citrusy floral odor 
ms  hooley  tom s boys ve been at it twenty four seven  we re extremely excited at the result 
mr  veals  it s previewable but rough  not really quite there yet  the first phil s digitals had a bug 
mr  tine jr   phil 
mr  veals  a small bug  but nasty  dregs of a turbovirus in the graphic encoder  phil s head kept detaching and floating off to
the upper right  not a good effect at all  given the message we want to send 
mr  yee  like orange blossoms  but with a kind of sick sweetness 
ms  hooley  oh dear 
mr  veals   sneezes   and debugging put us behind on some of the fonts  so you re going to have to use some imagination
here  has this     unit been downloaded for schematic matteing 
mr  tine jr   excuse me  phil 
mr  veals  introducing fully functional phil  the prancing ass 
ms  hooley  more like a mule  a burro  a burro 

 mr  tine jr    tapping like mad   an ass 
ms  hooley  horse characters were copyrighted by childsearch  their  patch the pony who says nay to strangers  spots 
mr  tine jr   a prancing ass 
ms  hooley  the perception of naivete and clumsiness about a mule icon provoked a kind of empathy in the response groups 
phil s not coming off as an authority figure joy killer type  more like a peer  so the cartridge he warns against gets none of the
forbidden fruit type boost of being warned against by an authority figure 
mr  veals  plus the kid market s a frigging horror show  near every species was copyrighted  garfield  mcgruff the freaking
crime dog  toucan sam  the o n a n  bird of prey  let s not even get into the bears or bunnies  it was basically either an ass or a
cockroach  never again the kid s market as god is my witness   sneezes  
ms  hooley  once we went with the burro  tom opted to accentuate the clumsy incompetence factor  to almost ironize the
icon  buck teeth  crossed eyes  
mr  veals  extravagantly crossed  like he s just been whacked with a sock full of nickels  eye response was through the roof 
ms  hooley  ears that won t stay upright  legs keep getting all rubbery and tangled when he tries to prance 
mr  veals  but prance he does 
mr  yee  but surely it doesn t present itself as an ass  surely it doesn t prance out and say   take it from me  an ass  
mr  veals  a fully functional ass 
ms  hooley  tom s rather ingeniously played up the functionality angle  the energy and verve versus passivity angle  he s
never just phil  he s fully functional phil  he s a blur of kid type activity   school  playing  teleputer interfacing  prancing 
tom s got him storyboarded for a number of thirty second activity packed little adventures  he s a goof  an iconic child  but he s
active  he stands for the attraction of capacity  agency  choice  as versus the spot s animated adult who we see in a recliner
ostensibly watching the canadian cartridge  little spirals going around and around in his eyes as his body sort of melts and his
head starts growing and distending until the passive watching adult s image is just a huge five o clock shadowed head in the
recliner  his eyeballs huge and whirling 
mr  tine jr    taps his ruler against the edge of the tabletop j
mr  veals  let s just roll the thing for them  mo 
mr  tine sr   i ve got to say i foresee trouble selling a certain commander in chief on a prancing ass as an improvement over a
singing kleenex 
ms  hooley  phil s message is that not every entertainment cartridge out there is necessarily a good old safe pre approved
interlace telenter tainment product  he says word s reached him during his fun filled fully functional daily activities of a certain
very wicked and sneaky cartridge that even has a little smiling face on the case and when you first start watching it looks like it
promises to be more fun to watch than anything you ve ever wished on a star or blown out a birthday cake candle for  in a
thought bubble that becomes visible when phil s ears flop down again  
mr  veals   sneezes   not yet matted in all the way  
mr  tine sr   you know how he is about kleenex 
ms  hooley    will be an image of an iconic cartridge case with a friendly smile and pudgy little harmless pillsbury
doughboy arms and legs 
mr  yee   loosening his collar   not the actual copyrighted pillsbury iconic limb animation codes  though 
mr  veals  relax  more like a reference  an allusion to plumpness  cute ness  pudgy and harmless looking limbs  is the thing 
mr  tine jr    tapping edge of tabletop with ruler  
mr  tine sr    pointing at tapping ruler with weatherman s pointer   you re close to losing that hand  bucko 
ms  hooley   referring to notes   then phil looks up and pops the thought bubble with a needle and says but it s a liar  this
smiling cartridge is  a wicked thing  lying  like the stranger who leans out of his car and offers you a ride home to your mommy
and daddy but really wants to grab you and put his sweaty hand over your mouth and lock you in the car and take you far away
with him to where you ll never see your mommy  daddy  or mr  bouncety bounce ever again 
mr  veals  which and here s the traumatic graphic at fourteen  a dark bordered new thought bubble over phil in which now
the cartridge s limbs are like a dockworker s  it s a swart leering cartridge with yellow fangs and long nails in a plaid cap and
overalls driving off with an animated kid splayed all screaming and horrified against the car s rear window  spirals starting to roll
in the kid s eyes  wait ll you see it 
ms  hooley  it s so scary it s positively riveting 
mr  veals   sneezes twice   stuff of fucking nightmares 
mr  yee  urgle  urgle urgle  splarg  kaa   falls from chair  
mr  tine jr   holy mackerel 
mr  tine sr   buster  buster 
ms  hooley  mr  yee s epileptic  severe  untreatable  happened twice on the chopper in  stress or embarrassment brings it on 
he ll be back up in a minute  just act natural when he comes back up 
mr  yee   heels drumming on terrazzo state house annex floor tile   ack  kaa 
mr  tine sr   jesus 
mr  tine jr    tapping ruler on tabletop s edge   jesus w  christ 
mr  tine sr    rising  indicating tapping ruler with extended weatherman s pointer   all right  god damn it  give me that thing 
give it here 
mr  tine jr   but chiefmr  tine sr   you heard me god damn it  you know it drives me bats  you ll get it back when we re done  drives me up the
wall  always has  what is it with you and that ruler 
ms  hooley  be up and back in the game in a jiff  he won t remember the fit  just don t mention it  the embarrassment of
mentioning it ll set it off again  that s why twice on the chopper  i learned the hard way 
mr  yee  splar  kak 

 mr  veals   hawking   for christ s sake 
ms  hooley   referring to notes   as the cartridge in the car in the thought bubble drives the splayed kid away  phil prances a
bit and warns that we don t even know for sure what the cartridge to watch out for is even about  he warns that the police only
know that it s something that looks like you d really want to watch it  he says all we know is it looks really entertaining  but that it
really just wants to take away your functionality  he says we know it s      canadian 
mr  veals  that s why the plaid cap in the traumatic graphic  response data indicates a plaid cap with earflaps signifies the
big c to over     of the spot s target  the overalls drive the association home 
ms  hooley  at nineteen seconds  fully functional phil then dances his warning dance  a native american cumbreakdance type dance we re hoping will catch on among younger dancers  his rhetorical thrust is to play it functional and safe
and make sure and check with mommy and  or daddy before watching any entertainment you haven t seen before  i e  to accept
no spontaneous dissemination and play no post delivered entertainment without checking with an authority figure 
mr  tine jr   but as a peer  more like   i m thinking this is what   better do  if i want to stay fully functional  
mr  yee   back upright in chair   somebody s mentioned the floppy ear and plastic buck teeth product tie ins 
mr  tine jr   jesus mr  yee  are you sure you re ok 
ms  hooley  ixnay on the entionmay 
mr  yee   sweat soaked  looking around   what did he mean  he didn t mean        
mr  tine sr   god damn it  rodney 
mr  yee  urg  splarg   falls from chair  
ms  hooley   clears throat   and finally  direly   can i say direly 
mr  veals  this is at       seconds 
ms  hooley  emphatically warns that if mommy and or daddy have been observed sitting in one position in front of the
home s viewer for an unusually long period of time  
mr  veals    without speaking  without responding to stimuli 
ms  hooley    or acting in any way unusual or distracted or creepy or spooky with respect to an entertainment on the viewer
 
mr  veals  we cut spooky on the last pass 
mr  yee  sklah  nnngg 
ms  hooley    that the fully functional kid ll never attempt to rouse them himself  and fully functional phil leans way in in a
kind of fish eye lens close up and says  no ho ho ho way  would he ever be so dumb as to even for a second plunk himself
passively down and have a look at what it is his parents are so silently  creepily engrossed by  but to vacate the premises and
prance as fast as he can to get a policeman  who ll know just how to cut the premises  power and help mum and dad 
mr  veals  his trademark expression is  no ho ho ho way   he works it in whenever possible 
mr  tine jr   his equivalent to the kleenex s  no thankee  
mr  tine sr   we re ready to view  i think 
mr  yee   back in seat  necktie now wrapped all the way around neck like aviator s scarf   still hashing out the tie ins with
hasbro et al 
mr  veals  we re all cued and ready 
mr  tine sr   let s have a look at the sucker 
ms  hooley  since tom s too modest to say so  i should say that tom s already storyboarded an extremely exciting adolescenttargeted version of fully functional phil  for music video and soft core disseminations  where phil engages in a great deal more
ironic self parody  and in this version his trademark expression becomes  it s your ass  ace  
mr  tine jr   so let s have a look at the bastard 
mr  tine sr   kid  your job here from here on out is to pipe down  now do you   
mr  yee  i ve been asked to say for transcription how pleased the glad flaccid receptacle corporation is  during this
potentially grave interval  to be a proud  
mr  veals   at the infernatron     viewer   hit those lights over behind you  kid 
mr  tine jr   this ll make it difficult for the transcriber to transcribe  can i say 
mr  yee  this spot doesn t happen to in any way optically pulse or strobe  does it 
mr  veals  are we all set 
mr  tine sr   so lights already 
gately s memories of  cheers    s nom now are clearer and vivider than any memory of the wraith dream or the whirling
wraith who said death was just everything outside you getting really slow  the implication that there might at any given time in
any room be whole swarms of wraiths flitting around the hospital on errands that couldn t affect anybody living  all way too fast to
see and dropping by to watch gately s chest rise and fall at the rate of the sun  none of this has sunk in enough to give him the
howlers  not in the wake of joelle s visit and the fantasies of romance and rescue  and the consequent shame  there s now a sandy
sound of gritty sleetish stuff wind driven against the room s window  the hiss of the heater  sounds of gunfire and brass bands
from cartridge viewers on in other rooms  the room s other bed s still empty and tightly made  the intercom gives that triple ding
every few minutes  he wonders if they just do it to bug people  the fact that he couldn t even finish ethan from in   th grade
english and hasn t got clue one about where ghostwords like sinistral or liebestod mean or come from  much less
ommatophoric  is just starting to percolate up to awareness when there s a cold hand on his good shoulder and he opens his
eyes  not to mention ghostwords  which is a real and esoteric word  he s been floating just under sleep s lid again  joelle van d  s
gone  the hand is the nurse that had changed the catheter bag  she looks hassled and unserene  and one cheekbone sticks out
farther than the other  and her little slot of a mouth s got little vertical wrinkles all around it from being held tight all the time  not
unlike the basically late mrs  g  s tight little mouth 
 the visitor said you d requested this  because of the tube   it s a little stenographic notebook and bic   are you left handed  
the nurse means sinistral  she s penguin shaped and smells of cheap soap  the notebook is stenographic because its pages

 turn over at the top instead of to the side  gately shakes his head gingerly and opens his left hand for the stuff  it makes him feel
good all over again that joelle had understood what he d meant  she hadn t just come to tell her troubles to somebody that couldn t
make human judgment noises  shaking his head slowly lets him see past the nurse s white hip  ferocious francis is sitting in the
chair that the wraith and ewell and calvin thrust had all sat in  his skinny legs uncrossed  gnarled and crew cutted and clear eyed
behind his glasses and totally relaxed  holding his portable o  tank  his chest rising and falling at about the rate a phone rings 
watching the nurse waddle tensely out  gately can see a clean white t  under the open buttons of ferocious francis s flannel shirt 
coughing is f f  s way of saying hello 
 still sucking air i see   ferocious francis says when the fit s passed  making sure the little blue tubes are still taped under his
nose 
gately struggles with one hand to flip the notebook open and write  yo   in block caps  except there s nothing to really hold
the notebook up against and write  he has to sort of balance it flat on one thigh  so he can t see what he s writing  and writing with
his left hand makes him feel like a stroke victim must feel  and what he holds up at his sponsor looks more like
 figured god needed a little help the other night did you   francis says  leaning way out to the side to get a red bandanna
hankie out of a back pocket   what i heard  
gately tries to shrug  can t  smiles weakly  his right shoulder is so thickly bandaged it looks like a turbanned head  the old
man probes a nostril and then examines the hankie with interest  just like the dream wraith did  his fingers are swollen and
misshapen and his nails are long and square and the color of old turtleshell 
 poor sick bastard going around cutting up people s pets  cut up the wrong people s pets  this is the way i heard it  
gately wants to tell ferocious francis how he s discovered how no one second of even unnarcotized post trauma infectionpain is unendurable  that he can abide if he must  he wants to share his experience with his crocodile sponsor  and plus  now
that somebody he trusts himself to need is here  gately wants to weep about the pain and tell how bad the pain of it is  how he
doesn t think he can stand it one more second 
 you saw yourself as in charge  thought you d step in  protect your fel lowman from his consequences  which poor sick
green ennet house fuck was it  
gately struggles to try and get his knee up so he can see to write  lenz  white wig  always north  always on
phone   again it looks cuneiform though  illegible  ferocious francis blows out a nostril and replaces the little tube  the tank in
his lap makes no sound  it has a little valve but no dial or needles 
 you stepped in against six armed hawaiians  i hear  marshall plan  captain courageous  god s personal shane   f f  likes to
send air through his nose s tubes in a mirthless burst  a kind of anti laugh  his nose is large and cucumber shaped and wide pored 
and pretty much its whole circulatory system is visible   glenny kubitz calls me and describes the thing blow by blowjob  says i
should see the other guys  says about breaking a hawaiian s nose  shoving the bits up into the brain  the old chop and stiff arm
he says  big don g  s a satanically tough motherfuck  this was his assessment  said the way he heard it you could fight like you
was born in a barfight  i tell glenny i say i m sure you ll be proud to hear him say it  
gately was trying with maddening sinistral care to write out  hurt  dead any  finist  who hat in hall    more
like drawing than writing  when without warning one of the day shift trauma m d s sweeps in  radiating brisk health and painless
cheer  gately remembers dealing with this one m d  some days ago in a kind of gray post surgical fog  this m d  is indian or
pakistani and is glossily dark but with a sort of weirdly classically white type face you could easily imagine profiling on a coin 
plus teeth you could read by the gleam of  gately hates him 
 so i am here with you again in this room   the m d  sings  kind of  when he talks  the name in gold piping on his white coat
has a d and a k and a shitload of vowels  gately almost had to reach up and swat this m d  after surgery to keep him from
hooking up a demerol drip  that was between let s say four and eight days ago  it s probably but for the grace that his
crocodilian sponsor ferocious francis g  s sitting here watching blandly when the pakistani m d  sweeps in this time 
plus they all have this flourishy m d  way of sweeping gately s chart up off their hip and holding it up to read it  the
pakistani purses his lips and puffs them out absently and sucks off his pen a little 
 grade two toxemia  synovial inflammation  the pain of the trauma is very much worse today  yes   the m d  says to the
chart  he looks up  the teeth emerge   synovial inflammation  nasty nasty  the pain of synovial inflammation is compared in the
medical literature to renal calculus and ec topic labor   partly it s the darkness of the classic face around them that makes the teeth
seem so high watt  the smile widens steadily without seeming to run out of new teeth to expose   and so you are now ready to let
us provide the level of analgesia the trauma warrants instead of toradol  simple headache ibuprofen  which these medications are
boys doing a large man s duty here  yes  there has been reconsidering in light of the level  yes  
gately is inscribing an enormous vowel in the notebook with incredible care 
 i make you aware of synthetic anipyretic analgesics which are no higher than category c iii       for dependence   gately
imagines the m d  smiling incandescently as he wields a shepherd s crook  the guy has that odd clipped singsong way of talking
of skinny guys in loincloths on mountains in films  gately superimposes a big skull and crossbones over the glossy face  mentally 
he holds up a palsied page high a and brandishes it at the m d  and then brings the notebook back down and swiftly up again 
spells it out  figuring ferocious francis will step in and set this ad man for the disease straight once and for all  so gately ll never
have to face this kind of pakistani temptation again with maybe nobody supportive here next time  c iii his ass  fucking talwin s
c iii  too 
 oramorph sr for an instance  very safe  very much relief  fast relief  
this is just morphine sulfate with a fancy corporate name  gately knows  this raghead doesn t know who he s dealing with  or
what he s 
 now i must tell tell  i would make the personal first choice of titrated hydromorphone hydrochloride  in this case   
christ  this is dilaudid  blues  fackelmann s mount doom  kite s steep angled decline  as well  death on a ritz  the blue
bayou  gene fackelmann s killer  by and large  and also gately pictures good old nooch  tall skinny vinnie nucci  from the
beach at salem  who favored dilaudid and spent over a year without ever taking the belt off his wing  dropping through osco
skylights at night on a rope with the belt all tight and ready just over his elbow already  nucci never eating and getting skinnier

 and skinnier until he seemed to be just two cheekbones raised to a great silent height  even the whites of his eyes finally turning
the blue of the bayou  and fackelmann s eliminated map after the insane scam on sorkin and a disastrous two nights of dilaudid 
when sorkin d  
   though i say yes  this in truth is a c ii medication  and i wish to respect all wishes and concerns   the m d  half sings 
inclined at the waist now by gately s railings  looking closely at the shoulder s dressing but not seeming at all disposed to even
touch it  his hands behind his back  his ass is more or less right in ferocious francis s face  who s just sitting there  the m d 
doesn t even seem to be aware    year sober ferocious francis is there  and francis isn t making a peep 
it also occurs to gately that esoteric is another ghostword he s got no rights to throw around  mentally 
 for i am moslem  and abstain also  by religious law  from all abusive compounds as well   the m d  says   yet if i have
suffered trauma  or the dentist of my teeth proposes to perform a painful process  i submit as a moslem to the imperative of my
pain and will accept relief  knowing no established religion s god wills needless suffering for his children  
gately has made two shaky smaller a s together on the next sheet and is stabbing emphatically at the sheet with his bic  he
wishes if the m d  wouldn t shut up he d at least move  so gately could shoot a desperate please jump in here look at ferocious
francis  the drug question has nothing to do with established gods 
the m d  s bobbing a little as he leans  his face coming in and then receding   this is a grade ii trauma we are looking at in
this room  allow me to explain that the discomfort of right now will only intensify as the synovial nerves begin to reanimate  the
laws of trauma dictate that the pain will intensify as healing begins to commence  i am a professional at my job  sir  as well as a
moslem  hydrocodone bitartrate         c iii  levorphanol tartrate         c iii  oxymorphone hydrochloride        
admittedly  yes  c ii  but more than indicated in this degree of needless suffering  
gately can hear ferocious francis blowing his nose again behind the m d  gately s mouth floods with spittle at the memory
of the sick sweet antiseptic taste of hydrochloride that rises to the tongue with an injection of demerol  the taste kite and the
lesbian burglars and even equus   i ll stick anything in any part of my body   reese all gagged at but that poor old nooch and
gene fackelmann and gately himself had loved  came to love like a mother s warm hand  gately s eyes wobble and his tongue
protrudes from a shiny mouth corner as he draws a crude syringe and arm and belt and then tries to draw a skull and bones over
the whole shaky ensemble  but the skull looks more like a plain old smiley face  he holds it out to the foreigner anyway  the
dextral pain s so bad he wants to throw up  throat tube or no 
the m d  studies the palsied drawing  nodding the exact way gately used to nod at alfonso parias carbo the totally
ununderstandable cuban   oxycodone nalaxone compound        with a short half life but only a c iii grading of abuse   there s
no way the guy could be like intentionally making his voice this wheedly sounding  it s got to be gately s own disease  the
spider  gately envisions his brain struggling in a silk cocoon  he keeps summoning to mind the little detox story ferocious
francis tells from the commitment podium  how they gave him librium       to help with the discomfort of withdrawal  and
how francis says he just threw the librium hard over his left shoulder  for luck  and has had very good luck ever since 
 likewise as well the time tested pentazocine lactate  which i can offer with assurances as a moslem trauma professional
standing here in this room in person with you at your bed s side  
pentazocine lactate is talwin  gately s    trusted standard when he was out there  which     mg  on an empty gut was like
floating in oil the exact same temperature as your body  just like percocet       except without the maddening back of theeyeball itch that always wrecked a percocet high for him 
 surrender your courageous fear of dependence and let us do our profession  young sir   the pakistani sums up  standing right
up next to the bed  the left side  his professional lab coat hiding f f   hands behind his back  the dull glint of the metal corner of
gately s chart just visible between his legs  immaculate of posture  smiling cheerily down  the whites of his eyes as ungodly white
as his teeth  the memory of talwin makes parts of his body gately didn t know could drool drool  he knows what s coming next 
gately does  and if the pakistani goes ahead and offers demerol again gately won t resist  and who the fuck ll be able to blame
him  after all  why should he have to resist  he d received a bona fide grade whatever dextral synovial trauma  shot with a
professionally modified     item  he s post trauma  in terrible pain  and everyone heard the guy say it  it was going to get worse 
the pain  this was a trauma pro in a white coat here making reassurances of legitimate fucking use  gehaney heard him  what the
fuck did the flaggers want from him  this wasn t hardly like slipping over to unit    with a syringe and a bottle of visine  this
was a stop term measure  a short gap type measure  the probable intervention of a compassionate unjudging god  a quick rxsquirt of demerol   probably at the outside two  three days of a demerol drip  maybe even one where they d hook the drip to a
rubber bulb he could hold and self administer the demerol only as needed  maybe it was the disease itself telling him to be
scared a medically necessary squirt would pull all his old triggers again  put him back in the cage  gately pictures himself trying
to shunt through a magnetic contact burglar alarm with a hand and a hook  but surely if ferocious francis thought a medically
advised short term squirt suspect  at all  the old reptilian bastard would say something  do his fucking job as a crocodile and
sponsor  instead of just sitting there playing with his nostril s little noninvasive tube 
 look kid  i m gonna screw and let you settle this bullshit and come back up later   comes francis s voice  subdued and
neutral  signifying nothing  and then the rasp of the chair s legs and the system of grunts that always accompanies f f  s getting up
from a chair  his white crew cut rises like a slow moon over the pakistani s shoulder  which the m d  s only sign of
acknowledgment of francis is to sort of tuck his chin down into his shoulder like a violinist  addressing gately s sponsor for the
first time 
 then perhaps you would please  mr  gately senior  if you please help us help your concerned and brave boy here but a boy i
believe whose cavalier attitude underestimates the level of coming discomfort which is sadly unnecessary altogether if he will let
us help him  sir   the pakistani sings over his shoulder to ferocious francis  as if they were the room s only adults  he s assuming
ferocious francis is gately s organic dad 
gately knows a crocodile never bothers to correct anybody s misimpres sion  he s halfway to the door  moving with
maddening slow care like always  as if walking on ice  twisted and seeming to limp off both legs and heartbreakingly assless in
the baggy seat shiny wide waled old man s corduroys he always wears  the back of his red neck complexly creased as he moves
off away  lifting one hand in a gesture of acknowledgment and dismissal of the m d  s request 

  not my business to say one way or the other  kid s gonna do what he decides he needs to do for himself  he s the one that s
feeling it  he s the only one can decide   he either pauses or slows down even further at the open door  looking back at gately but
not meeting his wide eyes   you keep your pecker up  kid  and i ll bring some of the son of a bitches by to look in again later   he
slips in  might want to ask for some help  deciding   the last of this comes from the white hall as the pakistani s glossy head
comes back in close with now a tight strained patience smile  and gately can hear him inhaling to get ready to say that of course
in grade ii traumas of this severe type the treatment of preferred indication is the admittedly c ii and highly abusable but
unsurpassed for effectiveness and tightly controlled administration of one    mg  tab in a diluting saline drip q      hours of
mep 
gately s good left hand skins a knuckle shooting out between the bars of the bedside crib railing and plunging under the
m d  s lab coat and fastening onto the guy s balls and bearing down  the pakistani pharmacologist screams like a woman  it isn t
rage or the will to harm so much as just no other ideas for keeping the bastard from offering something gately knows that he s
powerless at this moment to refuse  the sudden exertion sends a blue green sheet of pain over gately that makes his eyes roll up
as he bears down on the balls  but not enough to crush  the pakistani curtsies deeply and bends forward  crumpling around
gately s hand  showing all     teeth as he screams higher and higher until he hits a jagged high note like a big opera lady in a
viking helmet so shattering it makes the crib railings and windowglass shiver and woke don gately up with a start  his left arm
through the railing and twisted with the force of his attempt to sit up so that the pain now made him hit almost the same high note
as the dream s foreign m d  the sky outside the window was gorgeous  dilaudid colored  the room was full of serious a m  light 
no sleet on the window  the ceiling throbbed a little but did not breathe  the one visitor chair was back over by the wall  he
looked down  either the stenographer s notebook and pen had got knocked off his bed or the dream had made up that part  too 
the next bed was still empty and made up tight  it came to him all of a sudden why they called them hospital corners  but the
railing joelle van d  had folded down to sit on the bunk in the fucking erdedy kid s sweats was still folded down  and the other
railing was still up  so there was some like evidence of the one part  that she d been really there  showing him the pictures  gately
brought his skinned hand gingerly back inside the railing and felt to make sure there really was a big invasive tube going into his
mouth  and there was  he could roll his eyes way up and see his heart monitor going silently nuts  sweat was coming off every
part of him  and for the first time in the trauma wing he felt like he needed to take a shit  and he had no idea what arrangements
there were for taking a shit but suspected they weren t going to be appetizing at all  second  second  he tried to abide  no single
second was past enduring  the intercom was giving triple dings  there really were sounds of other rooms  tps  and of a meal cart
being rolled down the hall  and the metally smell of food for the edible patients  he couldn t see anything like a hat shadow in the
hall  but it could have been all the sunlight 
the dream s vividness had been either fever or disease  but either way it had fucking seriously rattled his cage  he heard the
singsong voice promising about increasing discomfort  his shoulder beat like a big heart  and the pain was sickeninger than ever 
no single second was past standing  memories of good old demerol rose up  clamoring to be entertained  the thing in boston aa
is they try to teach you to accept occasional cravings  the sudden thoughts of the substance  they tell you that sudden substancecravings will rise unbidden in a true addict s mind like bubbles in a toddler s bath  it s a lifelong disease  you can t keep the
thoughts from popping in there  the thing they try to teach you is just to let them go  the thoughts  let them come as they will 
but do not entertain them  no need to invite a substance thought or  memory in  offer it a tonic and your favorite chair  and chat
with it about old times  the thing about demerol wasn t just the womb warm buzz of a serious narcotic  it was more like the 
what  the aesthetics of the buzz  gately d always found demerol with a slight talwin kicker such a smooth and orderly buzz  a
somehow deliciously symmetrical buzz  the mind floats easy in the exact center of a brain that floats cushioned in a warm skull
that itself sits perfectly centered on a cushion of soft air some neckless distance above the shoulders  and inside all is a somnolent
hum  chest rises and falls on its own  far away  the easy squeak of your head s blood is like bedsprings in the friendly distance 
the sun itself seems to be smiling  and when you nod off  you sleep like a man of wax  and awaken in the same last position you
remember falling asleep in 
and pain of all sorts becomes a theory  a news item in the distant colder climes way below the warm air you hum on  and
what you feel is mostly gratitude at your abstract distance from anything that doesn t sit inside concentric circles and love what s
happening 
gately takes advantage of the fact that he s already facing ceilingward to seriously ask for help with the obsession  he
thinks hard about anything else at all  heading out w  old gary carty in the pre dawn reek of low tide off beverly to bring up
lobster traps  the m p  and the flies  his mother sleeping slack mouthed on a chintz divan  cleaning the very grossest corner of
the shattuck shelter  the billow of the veiled girl s veil  the traps  little cages of cross hatched bars  the lobsters  eyes  stalks
always poking through the squares so the eyes looked out at open sea  or the bumper stickers on the m p  s old ford  seeeee
yaaaaaaau and don t tailgate me or i ll flick a booger on your windshield  and mia 
and i haven t had sex in so long i forget who gets tied up  the fish asking about what s
water  the sharp nosed round cheeked dead eyed nurse with a weird germanish accent that would sell gately little sampler
bottles of sanofi winthrop demerol syrup     mg  bottle  vilely banana flavored  then would lie back slack and dead eyed while
gately x d her  barely breathing  in an airless ipswich apartment whose weird brown windowshades filled the place with light the
color of weak tea  named egede or egette  she eventually started telling gately she couldn t come close to coming unless he
burned her with a cigarette  which marked the first time gately seriously tried to quit smoking 
now a black outside linebacker of a st  e  s nurse rumbles in and checks his drips and writes on his chart and points the
artillery of her tits down at him to ask how he s doing  and calls him  baby   which nobody minds from enormous black nurses 
gately points at his lower abdomen in the area of his colon and tries to make a broad explosive gesture with just one arm  slightly
less mortified than if it had been a human size white nurse  at least 
gately happened onto demerol at age twenty three when intra ocular itching finally forced him to abandon percocets and
explore new vistas  demerol was more expensive mg  for mg  than most synthetic narcs  but it was also easier to get  being the
treatment of medical choice for mind bending post operative pain  gately can t for the life of him remember who or just where in
salem he was first introduced to what the boys on the north shore called pebbles and barns bams     and     mg  demerol

 tablets  respectively very tiny and tiny  chalky white scored discs with
on one side and sanofi winthrop co  s very soonon the other  that rakish
just puncturing the square envelope of itchy eyed north shore life 
beloved trademark  a kind of
and remembering even the
feels like entertaining the obsession  he knows it was not long after nooch s funeral  because
he d been alone and crewless at whatever moment whoever handed him two    mg  tablets way too tiny for his big fingered
hands  in lieu of whatever else it was he d wanted  laughing when gately said what the fuck and they look like bufferin for ants
or some shit  saying  trust me 
it must have been his twenty third summer out there  because he remembers being shirtless and driving down    when he
ran out of everything else and pulled off into the jfk library lot to take them  so small and tasteless he had to check his open
mouth in the rearview to make sure he d gotten them down  and he remembers not wearing a shirt because he d gotten to study his
big bare hairless chest for a long time  and from that somnolent p m  in the jfk lot on he d been a faithful attendant at the goddess
de merol s temple  right to the very finish 
gately remembers crewing   for good bits of both the percocet and de merol eras   with two other north shore narcotics
addicts  who gately d grown up with one and had broke digits for whitey sorkin the migrainous bookie with the other  they
weren t burglars  either of them  these guys  fackelmann and kite  fackelmann had a background in creative type checks  plus
access to equipment for manufacturing i d   and kite s background was he d been a computer wienie at salem state before he got
the shoe for hacking the phone bills of certain guys deep in trouble over     sex lines into the s s  administration s wats
account  and they became naturals at crewing together  f  and k   and had their own unambitious but elegant scam going that
gately was ever only marginally in on  what fackelmann and kite d do  they d rig up an identity and credit record sufficient to
rent them a luxury furnished apt   then they d rent a lot of upscale type appliances from like rent a center or rent   own down
in boston  then they d sell the luxury appliances and furnishings off to one of a couple dependable fences  then they d bring in
their own air mattresses and sleeping bags and canvas chairs and little legit bought tp and viewer and speakers and camp out in
the empty luxury apartment  getting very high on the rented goods  net proceeds  until they got their second overdue notice on the
rent  then they d rig up another identity and move on and do it all over  gately took his turn being the one to bathe and shave and
answer a luxury apt  rental ad in borrowed yuppiewear and meet the property management people and sweep them off their
banfis with his i d  and credit rating  and forge some name on the lease  and he usually crashed and got high in the apts  with
fackelmann and kite  though he  gately  had had his own digit breaking and then later burglary career  and his own fences  and
tended more and more to cop his own scrips and his own percocets and then later demerol 
lying there  working on abiding and not entertaining  gately remembers how good old doomed gene fackelmann   that
for a narcotics addict had had a truly raging libido   used to like to bring different girls home to whatever apt  they were
scamming at the time  and how fax d open the door and look around in pretend astonishment at the empty and carpetless luxury
apt  and shout  we been fuckin robbed  
for fackelmann and kite  the rap on gately was that he was a great and  for a narcotics addict  which places limits on
rational trusting  stand up guy  and a ferociously good friend and crewmate  but they just didn t for their lives see why gately
chose to be a narcotics man  why these were his substances of his choice  because he was a great and cheerful stand up jolly type
guy off the nod  but when he was pebbled or narculated in any way he d become this totally taciturn withdrawn dead like person 
they always said  like a totally different gately  sitting for hours real low in his canvas chair  practically lying in this chair whose
canvas bulged and legs bowed out  speaking barely at all  and then only the necessariest word or two  and then without ever
seeming to open his mouth  he made whoever he got high with feel lonely  he got real  like  interior  pamela hoffman jeep s term
was  other directed   and it was worse when he shot anything up  you d have to almost pry his chin off his chest  kite used to say
it was like gately shot cement instead of narcotics 
mcdade and diehl come in around     h  from visiting doony glynn down somewheres in the gastroenterology dept  and
try to give gately s left hand archaic old unhip high fives as a goof and say the bowel guys ve got glynn on a megadrip of a
levsin       codeine diverticulitis compound  and the doon seemed to have undergone a kind of spiritual experience vis a vis
this compound  and was giving them ebubblient high fives and saying the bowel m d s were saying that there was a chance the
condition might be inoperable and chronic and that d g  d have to be on the compound for life  with a rubber bulb for selfadministration  and the formerly fetal doon was sitting up in a lotus position and seemed to be a very happy camper indeed 
gately makes pathetic sounds around his oral tube as mcdade and diehl start to interrupt each other apologizing for how it s
looking like they might not be able to stand up and legally depose for gately like they d be ready to do in a fucking hatbeat if it
weren t for various legal issues they re still under the clouds of that their p d  and p o  respectively say that walking voluntarily
into norfolk district court in enfield would be tittymount to like judicio penal suicide  they re told 
diehl looks at mcdade and then says there s also disparaging news about the     item  that by everybody s reconstruction of
events it s more than likely lenz might have promoted the item up off the lawn when he legged it off the e m p h h  complex just
ahead of the finest  because it s fucking vanished  and nobody d have rat holed it and not given it up knowing what s at stake for
the good old g man in the deal  gately makes a whole new kind of noise 
mcdade says the more upbeat news is that lenz has been possibly spotted  that ken e  and burt f  smith had seen what
looked like either r  lenz or c  romero after a wasting illness on their way back from wheeling burt f s  to a meeting in
kenmore square  mostly from the side of the back they d seen him  wearing a back split tux and sombrero w  balls  and apparently
officially relapsed  back out there  drunk as a maroon  so totally legless when they saw him he was doing a drunk s old hurricanewalk  fighting his way from parking meter to parking meter and clinging to each parking meter  wade mcdade here thinks to
insert that the confirmed scuttlebutt is that e m p h h  is getting ready to rent out unit    to a long term mental health agency
caring for people with incapacitating agoraphobia  and that everybody at the house is speculating on what a constantly crowded
and cabin feverish place that s going to be  what with the terribleness of the predicted winter coming up  diehl says his nasal sinus
can always tell when it s going to snow  and his sinus is starting to predict at least flurries for maybe as early as tonight  they
never think to tell gately what day it is  that gately can t communicate even this most basic of requests makes him want to
scream  mcdade  in what s either an intimate aside or a knife twist at a staffer who s in no position to enforce anything  confides

 that he and emil minty are arranging with parias carbo   who works for an ennet house alum at all bright printing down near
the jackson mann school   for engraved looking formal invitations for the agoraphobic folks in unit    to all just come on out
and over to ennet house for a crowded noisy outdoor welcome to the e m p h h  neighborhood bash  and now gately knows
for sure it was mcdade and minty that put the help wanted sign up under the window of the lady in unit    that shouts for
help  the general level of tension in the room increases  gavin diehl clears his throat and says everybody says to say gately s like
wicked missed back at the house and everybody said to say    s up   and that they hope the g man s up and back kicking
residential ass very soon  and mcdade produces an unsigned get well card from his pocket and puts it carefully through the
railing s bars  where it lies next to gately s arm and begins to open up from being folded and shoved in a pocket  it s clear the thing
was shoplifted 
it s probably the pathetic unsigned folded hot card  but gately s suddenly stricken by the heat of the waves of self pity and
resentment he feels about not only the card but about the prospect of these booger chewing clowns not standing up to eyewitness
for his se offendendo after he just tried to do his sober job on one of their behalf and is now lying here in a level of increasing
dextral discomfort these limp punks couldn t imagine if they tried  getting ready to have to say no to grinning pakistanis about his
disease s drug of choice with an invasive tube down his mouth and no notebook after he asked for one  and needing to shit and to
know the day and no big black nurse in view  and unable to move   it suddenly seems awful starry eyed to be willing to look on
the course of events as evidence of the protection and care of a higher power   it s a bit hard to see why a quote loving god
would have him go through the sausage grinder of getting straight just to lie here in total discomfort and have to say no to
medically advised substances and get ready to go to jail just because pat m  doesn t have the brass to make these selfish bottomfeeding dipshits stand up and do the right thing for once  the resentment and fear make cords stand out on gately s purple neck 
and he looks ferocious but not at all jolly    because what if god is really the cruel and vengeful figurant boston aa swears up
and down he isn t  and he gets you straight just so you can feel all the more keenly every bevel and edge of the special
punishments he s got lined up for you    because why the fuck say no to a whole rubber bulbful of demerol s somnolent hum  if
these are the quote rewards of sobriety and rabidly active work in aa  the resentment  fear and self pity are almost narcotizing 
way beyond anything he d felt when hapless canadians punched or shot him  this was a sudden total bitter impotent job type
rage that always sends any sober addict falling back and up inside himself  like vapor up a chimney  diehl and mcdade were
backing away from him  as well they fucking might  gately s big head felt hot and cold  and his pulse line on the overhead
monitor started to look like the rockies 
the residents  between gately and the door  wide eyed  now suddenly parted to let someone pass  at first all gately could see
between them was the kidney shaped plastic bedpan and a cylindrical syringe snouted ketchup bottlish thing with fleet down
the side in cheery green  it took this equipment a second to signify  then he saw the nurse that came forward bearing the stuff  and
his raging heart fell out of him with a thud  diehl and mcdade made hearty farewell noises and melted out the door with the
vague alacrity of seasoned drug addicts  the nurse was no slot mouthed penguin or booming mammy  this nurse looked like
something out of a racy nursewear catalogue  like somebody that had to detour blocks out of her way to avoid construction sites at
lunchtime  gately s projected image of his and this gorgeous nurse s union unfolded and became instantly grotesque  him prone
and ass up on the porch swing  she white haired and angelic and bearing something away in a kidney shaped pan to the towering
pile behind the retirement cottage  everything angry in him evaporated as he got ready to just fucking die of mortification  the
nurse stood there and twirled the bedpan on one finger and flexed the long fleet cylinder a couple times and made an arc of clear
fluid come out the tip and hang in the win dowlight  like a gunslinger twirling his six shooter around to casually show off  smiling
in a way that simply snapped gately s spine  he began to mentally recite the serenity prayer  when he moved he could smell his
own sour smell  not to mention the time and pain involved in rolling onto his left side and exposing his ass and pulling his knees
to his chest with one arm    hug those knees like they were your sweetie  is what we say   she said  putting a terribly soft cool
hand on gately s ass   without jostling the catheter or i v s  or the thick taped tube that went down his mouth to god knows
where 
i was going to go back up to see about stice s defenestration  to check on mario and change my socks and examine my
expression in the mirror for unintentional hilarity  to listen to orin s phone messages and then the protracted death aria from
tosca once or twice  there is no music for free floating misery like tosca 
i was moving down the damp hall when it hit  i don t know where it came from  it was some variant of the telescopically selfconscious panic that can be so devastating during a match  i d never felt quite this way off court before  it wasn t wholly
unpleasant  unexplained panic sharpens the senses almost past enduring  lyle had taught us this  you perceive things very
intensely  lyle s counsel had been to turn the perception and attention on the fear itself  but he d shown us how to do this only oncourt  in play  everything came at too many frames per second  everything had too many aspects  but it wasn t disorienting  the
intensity wasn t unmanageable  it was just intense and vivid  it wasn t like being high  but it was still very  lucid  the world
seemed suddenly almost edible  there for the ingesting  the thin skin of light over the baseboards  varnish  the cream of the
ceiling s acoustic tile  the deerskin brown longitudinal grain in the rooms  doors  darker wood  the dull brass gleam of the knobs 
it was without the abstract  cognitive quality of bob or star  the turn signal red of the stairwell s lit exit sign  sleepy t  p 
peterson came out of the bathroom in a dazzling plaid robe  his face and feet salmon colored from the showers  heat  and vanished
across the hall into his room without seeing me wobbling  leaning against the cool mint wall of the hallway 
but the panic was there too  endocrinal  paralyzing  and with an overcog nitive  bad trip like element that i didn t recognize
from the very visceral on court attacks of fear  something like a shadow flanked the vividness and lucidity of the world  the
concentration of attention did something to it  what didn t seem fresh and unfamiliar seemed suddenly old as stone  it all
happened in the space of a few seconds  the familiarity of academy routine took on a crushing cumulative aspect  the total
number of times i d schlepped up the rough cement steps of the stairwell  seen my faint red reflection in the paint of the fire door 
walked the    steps down the hall to our room  opened the door and eased it gently back flush in the jamb to keep from waking
mario  i reexperienced the years  total number of steps  movements  the breaths and pulses involved  then the number of times i
would have to repeat the same processes  day after day  in all kinds of light  until i graduated and moved away and then began the
same exhausting process of exit and return in some dormitory at some tennis power university somewhere  maybe the worst part

 of the cognitions involved the incredible volume of food i was going to have to consume over the rest of my life  meal after meal 
plus snacks  day after day after day  experiencing this food in toto  just the thought of the meat alone  one megagram  two
megagrams  i experienced  vividly  the image of a broad cool well lit room piled floor to ceiling with nothing but the lightly
breaded chicken fillets i was going to consume over the next sixty years  the number of fowl vivisected for a lifetime s meat  the
amount of hydrochloric acid and bilirubin and glucose and glycogen and gloconol produced and absorbed and produced in my
body  and another  dimmer room  filled with the rising mass of the excrement i d produce  the room s double locked steel door
gradually bowing outward with the mounting pressure     i had to put my hand out against the wall and stand there hunched until
the worst of it passed  i watched the floor dry  its dull shine brightened behind me in the snowlight from the east window  the
wall s baby blue was complexly filigreed with bumps and clots of paint  an unmopped glob of kenkle s spit sat by the corner of
v r   s door s jamb  quivering slightly as the door rattled in its frame  there were scuffles and thumps from upstairs  it was still
snowing like hell 
i lay on my back on the carpet of viewing room    still on the second floor  fighting the sense that i d either never been here
before or had spent lifetimes just here  the entire room was panelled in a cool yellow shimmering material called kevlon  the
viewer took up half the south wall and was dead and gray green  the carpet s green was close to this color  too  the instructional
and motivational cartridges were in a large glass bookcase whose central shelves were long and whose top and bottom shelving
tapered down to almost nothing  ovoid would convey the case s shape  i had the nasa glass with my toothbrush in it balanced on
my chest  it rose whenever i inhaled  i d had the nasa glass since i was a little boy  and its decal of white helmeted figures
waving authoritatively through the windows of a prototype shuttle was faded and incomplete 
after a time  sleepy t p  peterson put his wet combed head in the door and said lamont chu wanted to know whether what
was happening outside qualified as a blizzard  it took over a minute of my not saying anything for him to go away  the ceiling
panels were grotesquely detailed  they seemed to come after you like some invasive e t a  patron backing you up against the
wall at a party  the ankle throbbed dully in the snowstorm s low pressure  i relaxed my throat and simply let the excess saliva run
post nasally back and down  the moms s mother had been ethnic quebecois  her father anglo canadian  the term used in the
yale journal of alcohol studies for this man was binge drinker  all my grandparents were deceased  himself s middle name had
been orin  his father s own father s name  the v r  s entertainment cartridges were arrayed on wall length shelves of translucent
polyethylene  their individual cases were all either clear plastic or glossy black plastic  my full name is harold james incandenza 
and i am       cm  tall in stocking feet  himself designed the academy s indirect lighting  which is ingenious and close to fullspectrum  v r   contained a large couch  four reclining chairs  a midsized recumbency  six green corduroy spectation pillows
stacked in a corner  three end tables  and a coffee table of mylar with inlaid coasters  the overhead lighting in every e t a  room
came from a small carbon graphite spotlight directed upward at a complexly alloyed reflecting plate above it  no rheostat was
required  a small joystick controlled the brightness by altering the little spot s angle of incidence to the plate  himself s films were
arranged on the third shelf of the entertainment case  the moms s full name is avril mondragon tavis incandenza  ed d   ph d 
she is     cm  tall in flats and still came up only to himself s ear when he straightened and stood erect  for almost a month in the

awakened contemplation of one s own death  i had held big buddy sessions in v r   throughout the month of september  the
moms had grown up without a middle name  the etymology of the term blizzard is essentially unknown  the full spectrum
lighting system had been a labor of love from himself to the moms  who d agreed to leave brandeis and head up the academy s
academics and had an ethnic canadian s horror of fluorescent light  but by the time the system had been installed and de bugged 
the gestalt of the moms s lumiphobia had extended to all overhead lighting  and she never used her office s spot and plate system 
petropolis kahn put his large shaggy head in and asked what was all this brooha upstairs  the thumps and cryings out  he
asked whether i was going to breakfast  the scuttlebutt on breakfast was sausage analog and oj with palpable pulp  he said  i
closed my eyes and recalled that i d known petropolis kahn for three years and three months  kahn went away  i could feel his
head s withdrawal from the doorway  a very slight suction in the room s air  i needed to fart but had not so far farted  the atomic
weight of carbon is       and change  a small and carefully monitored game of eschaton slated for the mid a m   with
 according to rumor  pemulis himself as game master  was certain to be snowed out  it had begun to occur to me  driving back
from natick on tuesday  that if it came down to a choice between continuing to play competitive tennis and continuing to be able
to get high  it would be a nearly impossible choice to make  the distant way in which this fact appalled me itself appalled me  the
founder of the sub    s 
tunnel club had been heath pearson as a very little boy  the rumor that pemulis himself would don the beanie for the next
eschaton came from kent blott  pemulis had been avoiding me ever since i returned from natick on tuesday   as if he sensed
something  the woman behind the register at the shell station last night had recoiled as i approached to present my card before
pumping  as if she too had seen something in my expression i hadn t known was there  the north american collegiate dictionary
claimed that any  very heavy  snowstorm with  high winds  qualified as a blizzard  himself  for two years before his death  had had
this delusion of silence when i spoke  i believed i was speaking and he believed i was not speaking  mario averred that himself
had never accused him of not speaking  i tried to recall whether i had ever brought the subject up with the moms  the moms was
at pains to be completely approachable on all subjects except himself and what had been going on between her and himself as
himself withdrew more and more  she never forbade questions about it  she just got so pained and blurry faced that you felt cruel
asking her anything  i considered whether pemulis s cessation of the math tutorials was perhaps an oblique affirmation  a kind of
you are ready  pemulis often communicated in a kind of esoteric code  it was true that i had kept mostly to myself in the room
since tuesday  the condensed o e d   in a rare bit of florid imprecision  defined blizzard as  a furious blast of frost wind and
blinding snow in which man and beast frequently perish   claiming the word was either a neologism or a corruption of the french
blesser  coined in english by a reporter for iowa s northern vindicator in b s        orin alleged in y t m p  that when he took
the moms s car in the morning he sometimes observed the smeared prints of nude human feet on the inside of the windshield 
v r   s heating duct s grille gave off a sterile hiss  all up and down the hall were sounds of the academy coming to life  making
competitive ablutions  venting anxiety and complaints at the possible blizzard outside   wanting to play  there was heavy foottraffic in the third floor hall above me  orin was going through a period where he was attracted only to young mothers of small

he stood for had taken seriously  relief that he was ok had dominated everyone s accounts of the whole incident  the moms
herself had apparently stayed by wayne s side late into the night at st  e  s  which booboo felt was estimable and just like the
moms  simply imagining the total number of times my chest will rise and fall and rise  if you want prescriptive specificity you go
to a hard ass  sitney and schneewind s dictionary of environmental sciences required    cm  hour of continuous snowfall 
minimum winds of    kph   and visibility of less than     meters  and only if these conditions obtained for more than three hours
was it a blizzard  less than three hours was  c iv squall   the dedication and sustained energy that go into true perspicacity and
expertise were exhausting even to think about 
it now lately sometimes seemed like a kind of black miracle to me that people could actually care deeply about a subject or
pursuit  and could go on caring this way for years on end  could dedicate their entire lives to it  it seemed admirable and at the
same time pathetic  we are all dying to give our lives away to something  maybe  god or satan  politics or grammar  topology or
philately   the object seemed incidental to this will to give oneself away  utterly  to games or needles  to some other person 
something pathetic about it  a flight from in the form of a plunging into  flight from exactly what  these rooms blandly filled
with excrement and meat  to what purpose  this was why they started us here so young  to give ourselves away before the age
when the questions why and to what grow real beaks and claws  it was kind  in a way  modern german is better equipped for
combining gerundives and prepositions than is its mongrel cousin  the original sense of addiction involved being bound over 
dedicated  either legally or spiritually  to devote one s life  plunge in  i had researched this  stice had asked whether i believed in
ghosts  it s always seemed a little preposterous that hamlet  for all his paralyzing doubt about everything  never once doubts the
reality of the ghost  never questions whether his own madness might not in fact be unfeigned  stice had promised something
boggling to look at  that is  whether hamlet might be only feigning feigning  i kept thinking of the film and cartridge studies
professor s final soliloquy in himself s unfinished good looking men in small clever rooms that utilize every centimeter of
available space with mind boggling efficiency  the sour parody of academia that the moms had taken as an odd personal slap  i
kept thinking i really should go up and check on the darkness  there seemed to be so many implications even to thinking about
sitting up and standing up and exiting v r   and taking a certain variable according to stride length number of steps to the
stairwell door  on and on  that just the thought of getting up made me glad i was lying on the floor 
i was on the floor  i felt the nile green carpet with the back of each hand  i was completely horizontal  i was comfortable
lying perfectly still and staring at the ceiling  i was enjoying being one horizontal object in a room filled with horizontality 
charles tavis is probably not related to the moms by actual blood  her extremely tall french canadian mother died when the
moms was eight  her father left their potato farm on  business  a few months later and was gone for several weeks  he did this sort
of thing with some frequency  a binge drinker  eventually there would be a telephone call from some distant province or u s 
state  and one of the hired men would go off to bail him out  from this disappearance  though  he returned with a new bride the
moms had known nothing about  an american widow named elizabeth tavis  who in the stilted vermont wedding photo seems
almost certainly to have been a dwarf   the huge square head  the relative length of the trunk compared to the legs  the sunken
nasal bridge and protruding eyes  the stunted phocomelic arms around squire mondragon s right thigh  one khaki colored cheek
pressed affectionately against his belt buckle  c t  was the infant son she d brought to the new union  his father a ne er do well
killed in a freak accident playing competitive darts in a brattleboro tavern just as they were trying to adjust the obstetric stirrups
for the achondroplas tic mrs  tavis s labor and delivery  her smile in the wedding photo is homo dontic  according to orin 
though  c t  and the moms claim mrs  t  was not a true homodont the way   for instance   mario is a true homodont  every
single one of mario s teeth is a second bicuspid  so it was all rather up in the air  the account of the disappearance  darts accident 
and dental incongruity comes from orin  who claimed to have decocted it all out of an extended one sided conversation he had
with a distraught c t  in the waiting room of brigham and women s ob gyn while the moms was prematurely delivering mario 
orin had been seven years old  himself had been in the delivery room  where apparently mario s birth was quite a touch and go
thing  the fact that orin was our one and only source for data shrouded the whole thing in further ambiguity  as far as i was
concerned  pinpoint accuracy had never been orin s forte  the wedding photo was available for inspection  of course  and
confirmed mrs  tavis as huge headed and wildly short  neither mario nor i had ever approached the moms on the issue  possibly
out of fear of reopening psychic wounds from a childhood that had always sounded unhappy  all i knew for sure was that i had
never approached her about it 
for their part  the moms and c t  have never represented themselves as anything other than unrelated but extremely close 
the attack of panic and prophylactic focus s last spasm now suddenly almost overwhelmed me with the intense horizontality
that was all around me in the viewing room   the ceiling  floor  carpet  table tops  the chairs  seats and the shelves at their backs 
tops  and much more   the shimmering horizontal lines in the kevlon wall fabric  the very long top of the viewer  the top and
bottom borders of the door  the spectation pillows  the viewer s bottom  the squat black cartridge drive s top and bottom and the
little push down controls that protruded like stunted tongues  the seemingly endless horizontality of the couch s and chairs  and
recumbency s seats  the wall of shelves  every line  the varied horizontal shelving of the ovoid case  two of every cartridge case s
four sides  on and on  i lay in my tight little sarcophagus of space  the horizontality piled up all around me  i was the meat in the
room s sandwich  i felt awakened to a basic dimension i d neglected during years of upright movement  of standing and running
and stopping and jumping  of walking endlessly upright from one side of the court to the other  i had understood myself for years
as basically vertical  an odd forked stalk of stuff and blood  i felt denser now  i felt more solidly composed  now that i was
horizontal  i was impossible to knock down 
gately s cognomen growing up and moving through public grades had been bim or bimmy  or the simulator  etc   from the
acronymic b i m    big indestructible moron   this was on boston s north shore  mostly beverly and salem  his head had been
huge  even as a kid  by the time he hit puberty at twelve the head seemed a yard wide  a regulation football helmet was like a

 beanie on him  his coaches had to order special helmets  gately was worth the cost  every coach past  th grade told him he was a
lock for a division   college team if he bore down and kept his eye on the prize  memories of half a dozen different neckless 
buzz cut  and pre infarcted coaches all condense around a raspy emphasis on bearing down and predictions of a limitless future
for don g   bimmy g   right up until he dropped out in high school s junior year 
gately went both ways   fullback on offense  outside linebacker on d  he was big enough for the line  but his speed would
have been wasted there  already carrying     pounds and bench pressing well over that  gately clocked a        in  th grade  and
the legend is that the beverly middle school coach ran even faster than that into the locker room to jack off over the stopwatch 
and his biggest asset was his outsized head  gately s  the head was indestructible  when they needed yards  they d shift to isolate
gately on one defender and get him the ball and he d lower his head and charge  eyes on the turf  the top of his special helmet
was like a train s cowcatcher coming at you  defenders  pads  helmets  and cleats bounced off the head  often in different
directions  and the head was fearless  it was like it had no nerve endings or pain receptors or whatever  gately amused teammates
by letting them open and close elevator doors on the head  he let people break things over the head   lunchboxes  cafeteria trays 
bespectacled wienies  violin cases  lacrosse sticks  by age thirteen he never had to buy beers  he d bet some kid a six he could take
a shot with this or that object to the head  his left ear is permanently kind of gnarled from elevator door impacts  and gately
favors a kind of long sided prince valiantish bowl cut to help cover the misshapen ear  one cheekbone still has a dented violet
cast from   th grade when a north reading kid at a party bet him a twelve pack on a shot with a sock full of nickels and then
clocked him under the eye with it instead of the skull  it took beverly s whole offensive line to pull gately off what was left of the
kid  the juvenile line on gately was that he was totally jolly and laid back and easygoing up to a certain point but that if you
crossed that point with him you better be able to beat a        
he was always kind of a boys  boy  he had a jolly ferocity about him that scared girls  and he had no idea how to deal with
girls except to try and impress them by letting them watch somebody do something to his head  he was never what you d call a
ladies  man  at parties he was always at the center of the crowd that drank instead of dancing 
it was surprising  maybe  given gately s size and domestic situation  that he wasn t a bully  he wasn t kindly or heroic or a
defender of the weak  it s not like he stepped kindly in to protect wienies and misfits from the preda tions of those kids that were
bullies  he just had no interest in brutalizing the weak  it s still not clear to him if this was to his credit or not  things might have
been different if the m p  had ever knocked gately around instead of focusing all his attention on the progressively weaker mrs 
g 
he smoked his first dubois at age nine  a hard little needle thin joint bought off jr  high niggers and smoked with three other
grade school football players in a vacant summer cottage one had the key to  watching broadcast televised niggers run amok in a
flaming l a  ca after some finest got home movied crewing on a nigger in the worst way  then his first real drunk a few months
later  after he and the players d hooked up with an orkin man that liked to get kids all blunt on screwdrivers and that wore
brownshirts and jackboots in his off hours and lectured them about zog and the turner diaries while they d drink the oj and
vodka he d bought them and look at him blandly and roll their eyes at each other  soon none of the football players gately hung
with were interested in much of anything except trying to get high and holding air guitar and pissing contests and talking
theoretically about xing big haired north shore girls  and trying to think up things to break over gately s head  they all had like
domestic situations too  gately was the only one of them truly dedicated to football  and that was probably just because he d been
told over and over that he had real talent and limitless futures  he was classified attention deficit and special ed  from grade
school on  with particular deficits in  language arts   but that was at least partly because mrs  g  could barely read and gately
wasn t interested in making her feel worse  and but there was no deficit in his attention to ball  or to cold foamers or screwdrivers
or high resin desbois  or especially to applied pharmacology  not once he d done his first quaalude       at age thirteen 
just as gately s whole recall of his screwdriver and sinsemilla beginnings tends to telescope into one memory of pissing
orange juice into the atlantic  he and the blunt cruel beverly players and bullies he partied with drinking whole quarts of throatwarming oj at a shot and standing ankle deep in grit on a north shore shore  facing east and sending long arcs of legal padyellow piss into onrushing breakers that came in and creamed around their feet  the foam warm and yellow shot with their piss  
like spitting into the wind   gately at the podium had started saying it turns out he was pissing on himself right from the start 
with alcohol   in just the same way  the whole couple years before he discovered oral narcotics  the whole period       when he
was a devotee of quaaludes and hefenreffer brand beer collapses and gathers itself under what he still recalls as  the attack of
the killer sidewalks   quaaludes and hefenreffer also marked gately s entree into a whole new rather more sinister and less
athletic social set at b m s   one member of which was trent kite        a dyed in wool laptop carrying wienie  chinless and
with a nose like a tapir  and pretty much the last fanatical grateful dead fan under age forty on the u s  east coast  whose place
of honor in the sinister beverly middle school drug set was due entirely to his gift for transforming the kitchen of any vacationing
parents  house into a rudimentary pharmaceutical laboratory  using like bbq sauce bottles as erlenmeyer flasks and microwave
ovens to cyclize oh and carbon into three ring compounds  synthesizing methylenedioxy psychedelics       from nutmeg and
sassafras oil  ether from charcoal starter  designer meth from tryptophan and l histidine  sometimes using only a gas top range
and parental farberware  able even to decoct usable concentrations of tetra hydrofruan from pvc pipe cleaner   which at that
time best of british luck ordering tetrahydrofruan from any chemical company in the    con tigs   provinces without getting paid
an immediate visit by d e a  guys in three piece suits and reflecting shades   and then using the tetrahydrofruan and ethanol and
any protein binding catalyst to turn plain old sominex into something just one h c molecule away from good old biphasic methaqualone  a k a  the intrepid quaalude  kite had called his quaalude isotopes  quovadis   and they were a great favorite for      year old bimmy g  and the slouched sharp haired sinister set he dropped ludes and quovadises with  washing them down with
hefenreffers  resulting in a kind of mnemonic brown out where the entire two year interval   the same interval during which the
ex m p  found somebody else  a newburyport divorcee who apparently put up a more sporting fight than mrs  g   and decamped
in his sticker covered ford with his seaman s bag and pea coat   the whole period s become in gately s sober memory just the
vague era of the attack of the killer sidewalks  quaaludes and    oz  hefenreffers awakened gately and his new droogs to the
usually dormant but apparently ever lurking ill will of innocent seeming public sidewalks everywhere  you didn t have to be
brainy trent kite to figure out the equation  quaaludes     not even that many beers    getting whapped by the nearest sidewalk

   as in you re walking innocently along down a sidewalk and out of nowhere the sidewalk comes rushing up to meet you 
whap  happened time after fucking time  it made the whole crew resent having to walk anywhere on quovadises because of not
having driver s licenses yet  which gives you some idea of the sum total i q  brought to bear on the problem of the attacks  a tiny
permanent cast in his left eye and what looks like a chin dimple are gately s legacy from the period before moving up to
percocets  which one advantage of the move deeper into oral narcs was that percocets   hefenreffers didn t allow you even
enough upright mobility to make you vulnerable co sidewalks  ever lurking ill will 
it was amazing that none of this stuff seemed much to hurt gately s performance playing ball  but then he was as devoted to
football as he was to oral cns depressants  at least for a while  he had disciplined personal rules back then  he absorbed
substances only at night  after practice  not so much as a fractional foamer between     h  and     h  during the seasons of
practice and play  and he settled for just a single dubois on thursday evenings before actual games  during football season he
ruled himself with an iron hand until the sun set  then threw himself on the mercy of sidewalks and the somnolent hum  he used
class to catch up on rem sleep  by freshman year he was starting on the beverly salem h s  minutemen varsity and was on
academic probation  most of the sinister set he d hung with were expelled for truancy or trafficking or worse by sophomore year 
gately kept hanging in and on til seventeen 
but quaaludes and quovadis and percocets are lethal in terms of homework  especially washed down with hefenreffer  and
extra especially if you re academically ambivalent and a d d  classified and already using every particle of your self discipline
protecting football from the substances  and   unhappily   high school is totally unlike higher education in terms of majorsport coaches  influence over instructors  athletes and grades wise  kite got gately through math and special ed  science  and the
french teacher was getting her strabysmic eyeballs fucked out by the minutemen s tanned lounge lizard of an offensive
coordinator on the behalf of gately and a semi retarded tight end  but english just fucking killed him  gately  all four of the
english teachers the athletic dept  tried gately on had this sieg heil idea that it was somehow cruel to pass a kid that couldn t do
the work  and the athletic dept  pointing out to them that gately had an especially challenging domestic situation and that
flunking gately and rendering him ineligible for ball would eliminate his one reason even to stay on in school   these were to no 
like  aveil  english was his sink or swim situation  what he then termed his  water lou   term papers he could more or less swing 
the football coach had wienies on retainer  but the in class themes and tests killed gately  who simply didn t have enough will left
over after sunset to choose like the crushingly dull ethan from over quovadis and hefenreffer  plus by this time three different
schools  authorities had him convinced he was basically dumb  anyway  but mostly it was the substances  this one particular b s h s  athletic dept  hired wienie of an english tutor spent a sophomore year march s worth of evenings in gately s company 
and by easter the kid weighed    pounds and had a nose ring and hand tremors and was placed by his frantic  functional parents
in a juvenile intervention rehab  where the wienie s whole first week of withdrawal was spent in a corner reciting howl in highvolume chaucerian english  gately flunked sophomore comp  in may and lost the fall s eligibility and withdrew from school for
a year to preserve his junior season  and but then  without the only other thing he d been devoted to  the psychic emergency brake
was off  and gately s sixteenth year is still mostly a gray blank  except for his mother s new red chintz tv watching couch  and
also the acquaintance of an accommodating rite aid pharmacist s assistant with disfiguring eczema and serious gambling debts 
plus memories of terrible rear ocular itching and of a basic diet of convenience store crud  plus the vegetables from his mother s
vodka glass  while she slept  when he finally returned for his sophomore year of class and junior year of ball at seventeen and    
lbs   gately was enervated  flabby  apparently narcoleptic  and on a need schedule so inflexible that he needed    mg  of good old
oxycodone hydro chloride out of his pocket s tylenol bottle every three hours to keep the shakes off  he was like a huge confused
kitten out on the field   the coach made him go in for p e t  scans  fearing m s  or lou gehrig s   and even the classic comics
version of ethan from was now beyond his abilities  and good old kite was gone by that last september of unsubsidized time 
admitted early on a full ride in comp  science by salem state u   meaning gately was now on his own in remedial math and
chem  on offense  gately lost his starting spot in the third game to a big clear eyed freshman the coach said showed nearly
limitless potential  then mrs  gately suffered her cirrhotic hemorrhage and cerebral blood thing in late october  just before the
midterms gately was getting ready to fail  bored eyed guys in white cotton blew blue bubbles and loaded her in the back of a
leisurely sirenless ambulance and took her first to the hospital and then to a medicaid l t i        out across the yirrell beach
span in pt  shirley  the backs of gately s eyes were too itchy for him to even be able to stand out on the red pocked stoop s steps
and see to wave adios  the first gasper he ever smoked was that day  a     out of a half finished pack of his mother s generics 
that she left  he didn t even ever go back to b  s h s  to clean out his lockers  he never played organized ball again 
i may have been dozing  some more heads came and awaited response and left  i may have dozed  it occurred to me that i
didn t have to eat if i was not hungry  this presented itself as almost a revelation  i hadn t been hungry in over a week  i could
remember when i was always hungry  constantly hungry 
then at some point pemulis s head appeared in the doorway  his strange twin towered a m  cowlick bobbing as he looked
back over each shoulder out into the hall  his right eye was either twitchy or swollen from sleep  something was wrong with it 
 mmyellow   he said 
i pretended to shade my eyes   howdy there stranger  
it is not pemulis s way to apologize or explain or worry that you might think ill of him  in this he reminded me of mario  this
almost regal lack of insecurity is hard to put together with his crippling neurasthenia on court 
 s up   he said  not moving from the doorway 
i could see my asking him where he d been all week leading to so many different possible responses and further questions that
the prospect was almost overwhelming  so enervating i could barely get out that i d just been lying here on the floor 
 lying here is all   i told him 
 so i just got told   he said   the petropulator mentioned hysterics  
it was almost impossible to shrug lying supine on thick shag   see for yourself   i said 
pemulis came all the way in  he became the only thing in the room that understood itself as basically vertical  he didn t look
very good  his color wasn t good  he had not shaved  and a dozen little black bristles jutted from the ball of his chin  he gave the
impression of chewing gum even though he was not chewing gum 

 he said  thinking  
 the opposite  thought prophylaxis  
 feeling a little punk  
 can t complain   i rolled my eyes up at him 
he made a sharp glottal stop  he moved toward the periphery of my vision and fit himself into the seam of two walls behind
me  i heard him sliding down to assume the back supported squat he sometimes liked 
the petropulator was petropolis kahn  i was thinking of the final film lecture in good looking men in small clever rooms
    and then of c t  s misadventure at himself s funeral  the moms had had himself interred in her family s traditional plot in
l islet province  i heard a whoop and two crashes directly overhead  my rib cage contracted and expanded 
 incster   pemulis said after a time 
a noteworthy thing turned out to be that the mound of earth on a freshly filled grave seems airy and risen and plump  like
dough 
 hal   pemulis said 
 javol  
 we ve got some really important interfacing to do  brother  
i didn t say anything  there were too many potential responses  both witty ones and earnest ones  i could hear pemulis s
cowlicks brush each wall as he looked to either side  and the slight sound of a small zipper being played with 
 i m thinking we could go someplace discreet and really interface  
 i m a highly tuned horizontal antenna tuned in to you lying right here  
 i was meaning could we go somewheres  
 so this urgency all of a sudden   i was trying to make my intonation jewish motherish  that melodic dip rise dip   all week 
not a call  not a card  now i should hear this about urgency  
 seen your mums around lately  
 haven t seen her all week  doubtless she s over helping c t  arrange a weather venue   i paused   i haven t seen him all week
either  come to think   i said 
 the eschaton s a no go   pemulis said   the map s a mess out there  
 we re going to get an announcement about the quebec kids very soon  i can feel it   i said  tm that highly tuned in this
position  
 what say let s skip the sausage analog and whip down to steak  n sundae and eat  
there was an extended pause as i ran a response tree  pemulis was zipping and unzipping something with a short zipper  i
couldn t decide  i finally had to choose almost at random   i m trying to cut down on patronizing places with   n  in their name  
 listen   i heard his knees creak as he leaned in toward the top of my head   about the tu savez quoi   
 the eeday emmay eezay  the synthetic bacchanal  that s definitely off  mike  talk about the map being a mess  
 that s part of what we need to interface about  if you d get off your literally your ass here  
i spent a minute watching the nasa glass fall and rise   don t even start  m m  
 what start  
 we re on hiatus  remember  we re living like shi ite moslems for the thirty days you miraculously blarneyed the guy into
giving us  
 blarney wasn t why we got it  inc  is the thing  
 and now  what  twenty days to go  we re going to produce urine like a mullah s babe  we agreed  
 this isn t   pemulis started 
i farted  but it didn t produce a noise  i was bored  i couldn t remember a time when pemulis had bored me   and i do not need
you launching temptation rhetoric my way   i said 
keith freer appeared in the doorway  leaning against the jamb with his bare arms crossed  he was still wearing the weird
unitard he slept in  which made him look like someone who tore phone books in half at a sideshow 
 does somebody have an explanation why there s human flesh on the hall window upstairs   he said 
 we re conversing here   pemulis told him 
i half sat up   flesh  
freer looked down at me   this is nothing to laugh at i don t think hal  there s i swear to fucking god a human strip of
forehead flesh upstairs on the hall window  and what looks like two eyebrows  and bits of nose  and now tall paul says down in
the lobby stice was seen coming out of the infirmary wearing something out of zorro  
pemulis was completely vertical  standing again  i could hear his knees as he rose   it s like a tete a tete in here  brother  we re
in here bunkered  mano a  
 stice got stuck to the window   i explained  lying all the way back down   kenkle and brandt were going to detach him with
warm water from a janitorial bucket  
pemulis said  how do you get stuck to a window  
 well from the looks it looks like they detached half his face from his head   freer said  feeling at his own forehead and
shuddering a little 
kieran mckenna s little porcine snout appeared in a gap under freer s arm  he still wore his stupid full head gauze wrap for
his supposed bruised skull   did you guys get to see the darkness  gopnik said he looks like a piece of cheese pizza where
somebody tore the cheese off  gopnik said troeltsch is charging two bucks a look   he ran off toward the stairwell without
waiting for a reply  his pocket jingling madly  freer looked at pemulis and opened his mouth  then apparently reconsidered and
followed off down the hall  we could hear a couple of sarcastic whistles at freer s unitard 
pemulis reappeared at the top of my vision  his right eye was definitely twitching   this is what i meant about going
someplace discreet  when have i ever urgently asked you to dialogue before  inc  
 certainly not within the last few days  mike  that s for sure  

 there was an extended pause  i raised my hands over my face and looked at their shapes against the indirect lights 
pemulis finally said  well  i m going to go make sure i eat before i have to see stice without a fucking forehead  
 have an analog for me   i said   let me know if there s word on the meet  i ll eat if i m going to have to play  
pemulis licked his palm and tried to get his cowlicks to behave  from my vantage he was high overhead and upside down   so
are you going to get up and go up and get dressed and stand on one foot with that opera thing on at some point  because i could
eat and then come up  we can tell mario we need to mano a tete  
now i was making a cage of my hands and watching the light through its shape as i rotated it   will you do me a favor  get
good looking men in small clever rooms that utilize every centimeter of available space with mind boggling efficiency out
for me  it s about a dozen cartridges in from the right on the third shelf down in the entertainment case  cue it up to about      
     maybe  the last five minutes or so  
 the third shelf down   i said as he scanned  tapping a foot   they ve got all himself s stuff together on the third shelf  
he scanned   baby pictures of famous dictators  fun with teeth  annular fusion is our fiend  i haven t even heard of half
your dad s shit that s here  
 it s friend  not fiend  either it s mislabeled or the label s peeling  and they re supposed to be alphabetized  it ought to be
right next to flux in a box 
 and me using the poor guy s lab   pemulis said  he loaded the player and turned on the viewer  his knees popping again as he
squatted to set the cue to       the huge screen hummed in a low pitch that ascended as it began to warm up  the screen taking on
a milky blue aspect like the eye of a dead bird  pemulis s feet were bare and i looked at the calluses on his heels  he tossed the
cartridge s case carelessly on a couch or chair behind me and looked down   what the fuck s fun with teeth supposed to be
about  
i tried to shrug against the friction of the carpet   pretty much what it says it s about   the funeral had been held on   or  
april in st  adalbert  a small town built around spud storage facilities fewer than five clicks west of the great concavity  we d all
had to fly up by way of newfoundland because of the volume of waste displacement launches that spring  and commercial
airlines hadn t yet had data on high altitude dioxin levels over the concavity  cloud cover prevented our seeing much of the new
brunswick coast  which i m told was a mercy  what happened at the funeral service itself was simply that a circling gull scored a
direct white hit on the shoulder of c t  s blue blazer  and that when he opened his mouth in shock at the direct hit  a large bluebodied fly flew right into his mouth and was hard to extract  several persons laughed  it was no huge or dramatic thing  the
moms probably laughed hardest of anyone 
the tp s tracker chugged and clicked  and the viewer bloomed  pemulis had been wearing parachute pants and a tam o shanter and lensless spectacles  but no shoes  the cartridge started close to what i d wanted to review  the protagonist s climactic
lecture  paul anthony heaven  all    kilos of him  gripping the lectern with both hands so you could see that he was missing his
thumbs  the sad dyed strands combed over his bald spot visible because he had his head down  reading the lecture in the deadening
academic monotone that himself so loved  the monotone was the reason why himself used paul anthony heaven  a
nonprofessional  by trade a data entry drone for ocean spray  in anything that required a deadening institutional presence   paul
anthony heaven had also played the threatening supervisor in wave bye bye to the bureaucrat  the massachusetts state
commissioner for beach and water safety in safe boating is no accident  and a parkinsonian corporate auditor in lowtemperature civics 
 thus the flood s real consequence is revealed to be desiccation  generations of hydrophobia on a pandemic scale   the
protagonist was reading aloud  peterson s the cage was running on a large screen behind the lectern  a number of shots of
undergraduates with their heads on their desks  reading their mail  making origami animals  picking at their faces with blank
intensity  established that the climactic lecture wasn t coming off as all that climactic to the audience within the film   we thus
become  in the absence of death as ideologic end  ourselves desiccated  deprived of some essential fluid  aridly cerebral  abstract 
conceptual  little more than hallucinations of god   the academic read in a deadly drone  his eyes never leaving his lectern s text 
the art cartridge critics and scholars who point to the frequent presence of audiences inside himself s films  and argue that the
fact that the audiences are always either dumb and unappreciative or the victims of some grisly entertainment mishap betrays
more than a little hostility on the part of an  auteuf pegged as technically gifted but narratively dull and plotless and static and not
entertaining enough   these academics  arguments seem sound as far as they go  but they do not explain the incredible pathos of
paul anthony heaven reading his lecture to a crowd of dead eyed kids picking at themselves and drawing vacant airplane  and
genitalia doodles on their college rule note pads  reading stupefyingly turgid sounding shit          for while clinamen and
tessera strive to revive or revise the dead ancestor  and while kenosis and daemonization act to repress consciousness and memory
of the dead ancestor  it is  finally  artistic askesis which represents the contest proper  the battle to the death with the loved dead 
  in a monotone as narcotizing as a voice from the grave   and yet all the time weeping  paul anthony heaven  as an upward
hall full of kids all scan their mail  the film teacher not sobbing or wiping his nose on his tweed sleeve but silently weeping  very
steadily  so that tears run down heaven s gaunt face and gather on his underslung chin and fall from view  glistening slightly 
below the lectern s frame of sight  then this too began to seem familiar 
he hadn t in the beginning burgled  gately  as a full time drug addict  though he did sometimes promote small valuables from
the apartments of the strung out nurses he x d and copped samples from  after the bailout from school  gately worked full time
for a time for a north shore bookmaker  a guy that also owned several titty clubs down rte    in saugus  whitey sorkin  that had
sort of casually befriended him when gately was still playing high profile ball  his professional association with whitey sor kin
continued part time even after gately discovered his real b e vocation  though he tended more and more toward less taxing
nonviolent crime 
but from age like eighteen to twenty three  gately and the prenominate gene fackelmann   a towering  slope shouldered 
wide hipped  prematurely potbellied  oddly priapistic  and congenitally high strung dilaudid addict with a walrusy mustache that
seemed to have a nervous life of its own   these two served as like whitey sorkin s operatives in the field  taking bets and
phoning them in to saugus  delivering winnings  and collecting debts  it was never clear to gately why whitey sorkin was called
whitey  because he spent a huge amount of time under ultraviolet lamps as part of an esoteric cluster headache treatment regimen

 and so was the constant shiny color of a sort of like dark soap  with almost the same color and coin of the realm classic profile as
the cheery young pakistani m d  who d told gately at our lady of solace hospital in beverly how teddibly soddy he was that
mrs  g  s cirrhosis and cirrhotic stroke had left her at roughly the neurologic level of a brussels sprout and then given him publictransportation directions to the point shirley l t i 
eugene   fax   fackelmann  who d dropped out of the lynn ma educational system at like ten  had met whitey sorkin
through the same eczema tic  gamble happy pharmacist s assistant gately had first met sorkin through  gately was now no longer
called bimmy or doshka  he was don now  nicknameless  sometimes donny  sorkin referred to gately and fackelmann as his
twin towers  they were more or less sorkin s paid muscle  except not in any sort of way important crime figures  paid muscle is
portrayed in popular entertainment  they didn t stand impassively flanking sorkin at crime figure meetings or light his cigar or
call him  boss  or anything  they weren t his bodyguards  in fact they weren t physically around him that much  they usually dealt
with sorkin and his saugus office and secretary via beepers and cellular phones       
and while they did collect debts for sorkin  including bad debts  especially gately   it s not like gately went around breaking
debtors  kneecaps  even the threat of coercive violence was pretty rare  partly  gately and fackelmann s sheer size was enough to
keep delinquencies from getting out of hand  and partly it was that everybody involved usually knew each other   sorkin  his
bettors and debtors  gately and fackelmann  other drug addicts  who sometimes bet  or more often dealt with gately and fackelmann for guys that did   even the north shore finest s vice guys  many of whom also sometimes bet with sorkin because he
gave the finest special civil servant reductions on vigorish  it was all like this community  usually gately s job on bad debts or
delinquent vig was to go around to the debtor at whatever bar the guy watched satellite sports at and just inform him that the debt
was threatening to get out of hand   making the debt itself seem like the delinquent party   and that whitey was concerned
about it  and work out some arrangement or payment plan with the guy  then the young gately d go into the bar s head and cellphone sorkin and get his ok on whatever arrangement they d worked out  gately was laid back and affable and never had a hard
word for anybody  hardly  nor did whitey sorkin  a lot of his bettors were old and steady customers  and lines of credit went with
the territory  most of the rare debt trouble that called for size and coercion involved guys with a gambling problem  kind of
pathetic furtive guys addicted to the rush of the bet  who got themselves in a hole and then tried suicidally to bet their way out of
the hole  and who d bet with several bookies at once  and who d lie and agree to payment arrangements they had no intention of
sticking to  suicidally betting they could keep all their debts in the air until they could square themselves with the major long shot
score they were always sure was around the corner  these types were painful  because usually gately knew the debtors and they d
exploit his knowing them and beg and weep and tug at both gately s and whitey sorkin s heartstrings with tales of loved ones and
wasting illnesses  they d sit there and look into gately s eyes and lie and believe their own lies  and gately would have to call in
the debtors  lies and sob stories and get sorkin s explicit decision on if to believe them and what to do  these types were gately s
first exposure to the concept of real addiction and what it can turn someone into  he hadn t yet connected the concept to drugs
really  except coke heads and hardcore needle jockeys  who at that point all seemed to him just as furtive and pathetic as the
gambling addicts  in their own way  these sob story   one more chance types were also the types that put whitey sorkin through
hell in terms of emotionally  causing whitey cluster headaches and terrible cranio facial neuralgia  and at a certain point sorkin
used to start adding  to the delinquent skeet  the vig  and the interest  extra charges for his own required intake of cafergot      
spansules and uv light and visits to enfield ma s national cranio facial pain foundation  the use of gately and fack elmann s
rump roast sized fists in actual hands on coercion got called for only when a compulsive debtor s lies and hole got serious enough
that sorkin became willing to forgo the guy s patronage in the future  at this sort of point  whitey sorkin s business objective
became to somehow induce the addicted debtor to cover his debts to sorkin before the debtor covered his debts to any of the other
books he was into  which meant for sorkin that he had to vividly demonstrate to the debtor that sorkin s was the least pleasant
hole to be in and the most important one to get out of  enter the twin towers  the violence was to be tightly controlled and
gradually progressive in like stages  the first round of incentivizing hose work   a light beating  maybe a broken digit or two  
usually fell to gene fackelmann  not only because he was the naturally crueler of the twin towers and rather liked putting a digit
in a car door  but also because he had a controlled restraint gately lacked  sorkin found that once gately got started in physically
on somebody it was like something ferocious and uncontrolled on a slope inside the big kid got dislodged and started to roll on its
own  and sometimes gately wouldn t be able to stop himself before the debtor was reduced to a condition where he wasn t even
going to be able to raise his head  much less funds  at which point not only did sorkin have to write off the debt but the big kid
donny d get so guilty and remorseful he d triple his drug intake and be no use to fucking nobody for a week  sorkin learned how
to use his towers to maximize their strengths  fackelmann got the first round light work for coercive collections  but gately was
better than fax at negotiating arrangements with guys so it never had to come to violence  and there were certain harder cases 
cases that laid sorkin out in bed with cranio facial stress for days at a time because they were hard case addicts that were either so
far gone or so deep in so many holes that fackelmann s light cruelty didn t resolve the situation  at an extreme point with some of
these cases sorkin got to a point where he was willing to forgo not only the debtor s future patronage but also the remittance due 
at a certain point the goal was to minimize future other hard cases by making it clear that w  sorkin was one book you couldn t
just flagrantly stay in the hole with and lie to for month after month without having your map seriously fucking reconfigured  here
again  in this type case gately s internal out of control slope of ferocity was superior to fackelmann s easy but ultimately shallow
sadism       
w  sorkin  like most psychosomatic level neurotics  was spiteful to his enemies and overgenerous to his friends  gately and
fackelmann each received    vig on the     vigorish sorkin took on every bet  and sorkin made over          worth of book
all over the north shore on a week s pro ball alone  which for most diplomaless young americans        per pre millennial week
would have been a very handsome living  but for the twin towers  rigid physical scheduling of narcotics needs was not even    
enough  weekly  gately and fackelmann moonlighted  and for a while separately   fackelmann s sideline with i d s and creative
personal checking  gately working freelance security for large card games and small drug deliveries   but even before they were
a real crew they copped as a unit  as in together  plus once in a moon with poor old v  nucci  for whom gately also occasionally
held the rope on late night osco and rite aid skylight missions  his entree to formal burglary proper  the fact that gately was
devoted to percocets and barn bams and fackelmann to dilaudid allowed them a high level of trust with each other s stashes 

 gately would do blues  which had to be injected  only when no oral narcs were to be got and he was face to face with early
withdrawal  gately feared and despised needles and was terrified of the virus  which in those days was laying out needle jockeys
left and right  fackelmann would cook up for gately and tie him off and let gately watch closely as he took the plastic wrap off a
mint new syringe and needle cartridge fackelmann could get with a fake medicaid iletin       i d  for diabetes mellitus  the
worst thing about dilaudid for gately was that the hydromorphone s transit across the blood brain barrier created a terrible fivesecond mnemonic hallucination where he was a gargantuan toddler in an xxl fisher price crib in a sandy field under a stormcloudy sky that bulged and receded like a big gray lung  fackelmann would loosen the belt and stand back and watch gately s
eyes roll up as he broke a malarial sweat and stared up at the delusion s respiritic sky while his huge hands throttled the air in front
him just like a toddler shakes at the bars of his crib  then after five or so seconds the dilaudid would cross over and kick  and the
sky stopped breathing and turned blue  a dilaudid nod made gately mute and sodden for three hours 
besides the maddening itch behind the eyes  fackelmann didn t like oral narcotics because he said they gave him terrible
sugar cravings that his huge soft slumped weight wouldn t tolerate indulging  not exactly the swiftest ship in her majesty s fleet
in terms of like upstairs  fackelmann was resistant to gately s pointing out that dilaudid also gave the faxman terrible sugarcravings  as did actually just about everything  the plain truth was that fackelmann just really liked dilaudid 
then good old trent kite got the administrative shoe from salem state  who informed him he d never study in the industry
again  and gately brought kite into the crew  and kite threw together some old time quo vadis for a small crew warming party 
and fackelmann introduced kite to pharmaceutical grade dilaudid  and kite found a new friend for life  he said  and kite and
fackelmann swiftly fell into the i d    credit history and furnished luxury apartment scam  in which by this time gately involved
himself pretty much only as a hobby  preferring bold nighttime merchandise promotion to fraud  which fraud tended to involve
meeting the people you stole from  which gately found slimy and kind of awkward 
gately lay in the trauma ward in terrific infected pain  trying to abide between cravings for relief by remembering a
blinding white afternoon just after xmas  when fackelmann and kite were off disposing of some of a furnished apartment s
furnishings and gately was killing time in the apartment laminating some false ma drivers licenses rush ordered by rich philips
andover academy       kids for what turned out to be the last new year s eve of unsubsidized time  he d been standing at an
ironing board in the by now pretty much unfurnished apartment  ironing laminates onto the fake licenses  watching good old
boston u  play clemson in the ken l ration magnavox kemper insurance forsythia bowl on a cumbersome first generation
inter lace hdv hanging on the bare wall  the high def viewer always now the last luxury furnishing to be fenced  the winter
daylight through the penthouse windows was dazzling and fell across the viewer s big flat screen and made the players look
bleached and ghostly  through the windows off in the distance was the atlantic o   gray and dull with salt  the b u  punter was a
hometown boston kid the announcers kept inserting was a walk on and an inspirational story that had never played a major sport
until college and now was already one of the finest punt specialists in n c a a  history  and had the potential to be a lock for a
pretty much limitless pro ball career if he bore down and kept his eye on the carrot  the b u  punter was two years younger than
don gately  gately s big digits could barely fit around the iron s ez grip handle  and stooping over the ironing board made the
small of his back ache  and he hadn t eaten anything except deep fried stuff out of shiny plastic packaging for like a week  and the
stink of the plastic laminates under the iron stunk wicked bad  and his big square face sagged lower and lower as he stared at the
punter s ghostly digital image until he found himself starting to cry like a babe  it came out of emotional nowheres all of a sudden 
and he found himself blubbering at the loss of organized ball  his one gift and other love  his own stupidity and lack of discipline 
that blasted cocksucking ethan from  his mom s sir osis and vegetabilization and his failure after four years ever yet to visit 
feeling suddenly lower than bottom feeder shit  standing over hot laminates and polaroid squares and little stick on d m v  letters
for rich blond male boys  in the blazing winter light  blubbering amid fraudulent stink and tear steam  it was two days later he got
pinched for assaulting one bouncer with the unconscious body of another bouncer  in danvers ma  and three months after that
that he went to billerica minimum 
entrepot bound  twitchy eyed and checking both sides behind him as he comes  rounding the curve of subdormitory b s hall
with his stick and little solid frustum shaped stool  michael pemulis sees at least eight panels of the drop ceiling have somehow
fallen out of their aluminum struts and are on the floor   some broken in that incomplete  hingey way stuff with fabric content
gets broken   including the relevant panel  no old sneaker is in evidence on the floor as he clears the panels to plant the stool  his
incredibly potent bentley phelps penlight in his teeth  looking up into the darkness of the struts  lattice 
given the faxter s historical proclavity for fraudulent scams  it was amazing to gately that he didn t ever know how
fackelmann had been fraudulently getting over on whitey sorkin in all kinds of little ways almost from the start  and didn t even
find it out until the not at all small scam with eighties bill and sixties bob  which took place during the three months gately was
out on bail sorkin had generously put up  by this time gately had fallen in with two lesbian pharmaceutical cocaine addicts he d
met at the gym doing upside down sit ups from the chin up bar  the lesbians  not gately  who was strictly from bench  curl  and
squat   these vigorous girls ran a rather intriguing house cleaning and key copying and burglary operation in peabody and
wakefield  and gately had begun working heavy merchandise lifting and  x  vehicle promotion for them  serious full time
burglary  as his taste for even the threat of violence diminished on account of remorse at the bouncer damage he d inflicted in that
danvers bar after just seven hefenreffers and an innocent comment about the b  s h s  s min utemen s inferiority to the danvers
h s  roughriders  and gately left more and more of sorkin s transfer and collection work to fackelmann  who by this time had
gotten back into oral narcotics out of virus fears and stopped resisting the sugar cravings he associated with oral narcs and gotten
so fat and soft his shirtfront looked like an accordion when he sat down to eat peanut m m s and nod  and now also to a badnews new guy sorkin had lately befriended and put to work  a fuchsia haired harvard square punk type kid with a build like a
stump and round black unblinking eyes  an old fashioned street junk needle jockey that went by the moniker bobby c or just  c  
and liked to hurt people  the only i v  heroin addict gately d come across that actually preferred violence  with no lips at all and
purple hair in three great towering spikes and little bare patches in the hair on his forearms   from constantly testing the edge on
his boot knife   and a leather jacket with way more zippers than anybody could ever need  and a pre electric earring that hung
way down and was a roaring skull in gold plate flames 
gene fackelmann had  it turns out  for years been getting fraudulently over on whitey sorkin s bookmaking operation in all

 sorts of little ways that gately and kite  according to kite  hadn t known about  usually it was something like fax taking longshot action from marginal bettors not well known to sorkin and not phoning the action in to sorkin s secretary  and then  when the
long shot lost  collecting the skeet plus vig       from the bettor and rat holing it all for himself  it had seemed to gately after he
found out about it a suicidal type risk  since if any of these long shots ever actually won fackelmann would be responsible for
giving the bettor his winnings from  whitey    meaning it would be sorkin that would hear the complaint if fackelmann didn t
come up with the   on his own and get it to the bettor   and the whole crew s pharmacological expenses meant they always
existed on the absolutest margins of liquidity  at least that s what gately and kite  according to kite  had always thought  it wasn t
until fackelmann s map had been presumably eliminated for keeps and kite had returned from his long highatus and gately and
kite were getting the late fackelmann s stuff together to divvy up valuables and dump the rest and gately found  taped to the
underside of fackelmann s porn cartridge storage case  over         in mint crisp o n a n  currency  not until then that gately
realized that fack elmann had through iron will kept unspent an emergency reserve skeet payment stake for just such a worst case
possibility  gately split this found fackelmann   with trent kite  then but went and turned his half of it in to sorkin  claiming it
was all they d found  it wasn t that he forked his half over to sorkin out of any kind of fear   sorkin would have regretfully had
the c kid and his nuck fag crew demap him  gately  too  along with fack elmann  if he d thought gately had been part of fax s
scam   but out of guilt over having been clueless about his own fellow twin tower screwing sorkin after sorkin had been so
neurasthenically over generous to them both  and because fackelmann s betrayal had ended up so hurting sorkin and causing him
so much psychosomatic grief that he d spent a whole week in bed in saugus in the dark with lone ranger type sleep shades on 
drinking vo and cafergot and clutching his traumatized cranium and face  feeling betrayed and abandoned  he d said  his whole
faith in the human creature shaken  he d wept to gately over the cellular phone  after it all came out  ultimately  gately gave
sorkin his half of fackelmann s secret   mostly to try and cheer sorkin up  let him know somebody cared  he also did it for
fackelmann s memory  which he was mourning fax s gruesome death even at the same time he cursed him for a liar and rat punk 
it was a time of moral confusion for don g   and his half of the post mortem   seemed like the best he could do in terms of like a
gesture  he didn t rat out that kite had a whole other half  which kite spent his half of the   on grateful dead bootlegs and a
portable semiconductor refrigeration unit for his d e c       s motherboard that upped his processing capacity to    mb  of
ram  roughly the same as an interlace disseminator substation or an nne bell cellular switchnet  though it wasn t two
months before he d pawned the d e c  and put it in his arm  and had become such a steeply downhill type dilaudid addict that
when he signed on as gately s new trusted associate for b es after gately got out of billerica the once mighty kite wasn t even
able to dicky an alarm or shunt a meter  and gately found himself the brains of the team  which it was a mark of his own highangle decline that this fact didn t make him more nervous 
the r n  that d flushed his colon while gately wept with shame is now back in the room with an m d  gately hasn t seen
before  he lies there pinwheel eyed from pain and efforts to abide via memory  one eye has some sort of blurry sleep goop film
in it that won t blink or rub away  the room is filled with mournful gunmetal winter p m  light  the m d  and gorgeous r n  are
doing something to the room s other bed  attaching something metally complex from out of a big case not unlike a good tablesilverware case  with molded purple velvet insides for metal rods and two half circles of steel  the intercom dings  the m d  s got
a beeper at his belt  an object with still more unhealthy associations  gately hasn t exactly been asleep  the heat of his post op
fever makes his face feel tight  like standing too close to a fire  his right side s settled down to a sick ache like a kicked groin 
fackelmann s favorite phrase had been  that s a goddamned lie   he d used it in response to just about everything  his mustache
always looked like it was getting ready to crawl off his lip  gately s always despised facial hair  the former naval m p  had had a
great big yellow gray mustache he waxed into two sharp protruding steer horns  the m p  was vain about his mustache and spent
giant amounts of time clipping and grooming and waxing it  when the m p  passed out  gately used to come quietly up and gently
push the stiff waxed sides of the mustache into crazy canted angles  sorkin s new third field operative c d claimed to collect ears
and to have a collection of ears  bobby c with his lightless eyes and flat lipless head  like a reptile  the m d  was one of those
apprentice residential m d s that looked about twelve  scrubbed and groomed to a dull pink shine  he radiated the bustling cheer
they teach m d s how to radiate at you  he had a child s haircut  complete with spit curl  and his thin neck swam in the collar of
his white m d  coat  and his coat s pens  pocket protector and the owlish glasses he kept pushing up  together with the little neck 
gave gately the sudden insight that most m d s and a d a s and p d  p o s and shrinks  the fearsomest authority figures in a drug
addict s life  that these guys came from the pencil necked ranks of the same weak chinned wienie kids that drug addicts used to
despise and revile and bully  as kids  the r n  was so attractive in the gray light and goop blur it was almost grotesque  her tits
were such that she had a little cleft of cleavage showing even over her r n  s uniform  which was not like a low neckline thing 
the milky cleavage that suggests tits like two smooth scoops of vanilla ice cream that your healthy type girls all have probably
got  gately s forced to confront the fact that he s never once been with a really healthy girl  and not with even so much as a girl of
any kind in sobriety  and then when she reaches way up to unscrew a bolt in some kind of steelish plate on the wall over the
empty bed the like hemline of her uniform retreats up north so that the white stockings  rich violinish curves at the top of the
insides of her legs in the white lisle are visible in backlit silhouette  and an embrasure of sad windowlight shines through
her legs  the raw healthy sexuality of the whole thing just about makes gately sick with longing and self pity  and he wants to
avert his head  the young m d  is also staring at the lissome stretch and retreating hem  not even pretending to help with the bolt 
missing as he goes to push up the glasses so that he stabs himself in the forehead  the m d  and r n  exchange several pieces of
real technical medical language  the m d  drops his clipboard twice  the r n  either doesn t notice any of the sexual tension in
the room because she s spent her whole life as the eye of a storm of sexual tension  or else she just pretends not to notice  gately s
almost positive the m d  s jacked off before to the thought of this r n   and he feels sick that he totally empathizes with the m d 
it d be circumambient sexual tension  would be the ghostword  gately d never even let an unhealthy strung out type female
go into the head for at least an hour after he d taken a dump in there  out of embarrassment  and now this sickening circumambient
creature had with her own fleet syringe and soft hands summoned a loose pathetic dump from the anus of bimmy gately  which
anus she had thus seen close up  producing a dump 
it doesn t even register on gately that it s spitting a little goopy sleet outside until he s made himself avert his head from the
window and r n  the ceiling s throbbing a little  like a dog when it s hot  the r n  had told him  from behind  her name was

 cathy or kathy  but gately wants to think of her as just the r n  he can smell himself  a smell like sandwich meat left in the sun 
and feel greasy sweat purling all over his scalp  and his unshaved chin against his throat  and the tube taped into his mouth is tacky
with the scum of sleep  the thin pillow is hot and he has no way to flip it over to the cool side of the pillow  it s like his shoulder s
grown its own testicles and every time his heart beats some very small guy kicked him in them  the testicles  the m d  sees
gately s open eyes and tells the nurse the gunshot patient is semiconscious again and is he q d for any kind of p m  med  the
sleetfall is slight  it sounds like somebody s throwing little fistfuls of sand at the window from real far away  the deadly r n  
helping the m d  clamp some kind of weird steel back braceish thing with what looks like a metal halo they d put together from
parts out of the big case  clamping the thing to the head of the bed and to little steel plates under the bed s heart monitor   it looks
sort of like the upper part of an electric chair  he thinks   the r n  looks down in mid stretch and says hi mr  gately and says
mr  gately is allergic and doesn t get any meds except antipyretics and toradol in a drip dr  pressburger do you mr  gately you
poor brave allergic thing  her voice is like you can just imagine what she d sound like getting x d and really liking it  gately s
repelled at himself for having taken a dump in front of this kind of r n  the m d  s name had sounded just like  pressburger  or
 priss burger   and gately s now sure the poor yutz d taken daily ass kickings from sinister future drug addicts  as a kid  the m d  s
perspiring in the ambient sexuality of the r n  he says  the m d  does  so what s he intu bated for if he s conscious and selfventilating and on a drip  this is while the m d  s trying to screw the metal halo itself to the top of the back braceish thing with
bolt head screws  one knee up on the bed and stretching so part of the red soft upper part of his ass is showing over his belt  not
being able to get the thing screwed on  shaking the metal halo like it s its stubborn fault  and even lying there gately can tell the
guy s turning the bolt head screws the wrong way  the r n  comes over and puts a cool soft hand on gately s forehead in a way
that makes the forehead want to die with shame  what gately can get from what she says to dr  pressburger is that there d been
concern that gately might have got a fragment of whatever projectile he got invaded with in  through  or near his lower something
trachea  since there d been trauma to his something with six syllables that started with sterno  she said the radiology results
were indefinite but suspicious  and somebody called pendleton had wanted a    mm  siphuncular nebulizer dispensing   ml  of
    mucomyst       q    h  on the off chance of hemorrhage or mucoidal flux  like just in case  the parts of this gately can
follow he doesn t care for one bit  he doesn t want to know his body even fucking has something with six syllables in it  the
horrifying r n  wipes gately s face off as best she can with her hand and says she ll try to fit him in for a sponge bath before she
goes off shift at     h   at which gately goes rigid with dread  the r n  s hand smells of kiss my face brand organic hand and
body lotion  which pat montesian also uses  she tells the poor m d  to let her have a try at the cranial brace  those things are
always a bear to screw in  her shoes are those subaudible nurses  shoes that make no sound  so it seems like she glides away from
gately s bed instead of walks away  her legs aren t visible until she gets a certain ways away  the m d  s own shoes have a wet
squeak to the left one  the m d  looks like he hasn t slept well in about a year  there s a faint vibe of prescription  drines about the
guy  on gately s view  he paces squeakily at the foot of the bed watching the r n  turn the screws the right way and pushes his
owlish glasses up and says that clifford pendleton  scratch golfer or no  is a post traumatic maroon  that nebulized mucomyst is
for  and here his voice makes it clear he s reciting from memory  like to show off  abnormal  viscid  or inspissated post traumatic
mucus  not potential hemorrhaging or edema  and that    mm  siphuncular intubation itself had been specifically discreditated as
an intratracheal edema prophylaxis in the second to latest issue of morbid trauma quarterly as so diametrically invasive that it
was more apt to exacerbate than to alleviate hemoptysis  according to somebody he calls  laird  or  layered   gately s listening in
with the uncomprehending close attention of like a child whose parents are discussing something adultly complex about child care
in its presence  the condescension with which prissburger inserts that hemoptysis means something called  pertussive
hemorrhage   like kathy the r n  wasn t enough of a pro not to have to insert little technical explanations for  makes gately sad
for the guy   it s obvious the guy pathetically thinks this kind of limp condescending shit will impress her  gately s got to admit
he would have tried to impress her  too  though  if she hadn t met him by holding a kidney shaped pan under his working anus 
the r n  s finishing packing up the parts of the brace thing the m d  couldn t seem to attach  meanwhile  she was saying the m d 
seemed awful well up on methodology for something called a  r  as they left  and gately could tell the m d  couldn t tell she was
being a little sarcastic  the m d  was struggling to try to carry the thing s case  which gately judges weighs at most    kg  it
occurs to him head on for the first time that the real reason stavros l  hired shelter cleaning guys out of halfway houses was that
he could get away with paying them like bupkis  and that he  don g   must surely on some level have known this all along but
been in some kind of denial about confronting it head on that he was getting fucked over by stavros the shoe freak  and that the
word embrasure had been surely another invasive wraith ghostword  and then now also that nobody seems to exactly be falling all
over themself to bring the paper and pen it had sure seemed like joelle van d  had understood gately s mimed request for  and that
thus maybe joelle s visit and show and tell with the snapshots had been just as much a febrile hallucination as the figuranted
wraith  and that it has stopped spitting sleet but the clouds out there still look like they mean serious business out there over
brighton allston  and that if joelle v d  s intimate visit with the photo album was a hallucination that at least meant it was also a
hallucination she was wearing fucking college kid ken erdedy s sweatpants  and that the low angled sadness of the cloudy p m 
light meant it had to be pretty near     h  est so that maybe there by the grace he could avoid maybe getting an uncontrolled
woodie getting sponged naked by the horrifyingly attractive k cathy and but still could get sponged by her linebacker of a
replacement  because the sour meaty smell of himself was grim  only maybe miss the woodie hazard and get sponged by the big
hairy moled          h  nurse in support hose to who gately s anus was a stranger  plus that     h  est was spontaneousdissemination time for mr  bouncety bounce  the mentally ill kiddy show host gately s always loved and used to try his best with
kite and poor old fackelmann to be home and largely alert for  and that nobody s once offered to click on the hd viewer that
hangs next to a myopic fake turner fog and boat print on the wall opposite gately s and the former kid s beds  and that he had no
remote with which to either activate the tp at      or ask somebody else to activate it  that without some kind of notebook and
pencil he couldn t communicate even the basicest question or like concept to anybody   it was like he was a vegetated
hemorrhagic stroke victim  without a pencil and notebook he couldn t even seem to get across a request for a notebook and
pencil  it was like he was trapped inside his huge chattering head  unless  his head then points out  joelle van dyne s visit had
been real and her understanding of the pen and notebook gesture had been real  and but somebody out there in the hallway with a
hat or at the hospital president s office or at the nurses  station with his innerdicted m  hanley brownies had also innerdicted the

 request for writing supplies  at the finest s request  so he couldn t get his story straight with anybody before they came for him 
that it was like a pre interrogation softening up thing  they were leaving him trapped in himself  a figurant  mute and unmoving
and blank like the house s catatonic lady slumped moist and pale in her chair or the advanced basics group s adopted girl s
vegetable kingdom sister  or the whole catatonic gang over at e m p h h  s    shed  silent and dead faced even when touching a
tree or propped up amid exploding front lawn firecrackers  or the wraith s nonexistent kid  it s got to be past     h   light wise 
unless it s the lowering clouds  there s roughly    or less visibility now outside the sleet crusted window  the room s
windowlight is darkening to that kaopec tate shade that has always marked the just pre sunset time of day that gately  like most
drug addicts  has always most dreaded  and had always either lowered his helmet and charged extra murderous at somebody to
block it out  the late day dread  or else dropped quovadis or oral narcotics or turned on mr  bouncety bounce extra loud or
busied himself in his silly chef s hat in the ennet house kitchen or made sure he was at a meeting sitting way up close in nosepore range  to block it out  the late day dread   the gray light late afternoon dread  always worse in winter  the dread  in winter s
watered down light   just like the secret dread he s always felt whenever everybody happened to ever leave the room and left
him alone in a room  a terrible stomach sinking dread that probably dates all the way back to being alone in his xxl dentons and
crib below herman the ceiling that breathed 
it occurs to gately that right now s just like when he was a toddler and his mom and her companion were both passed out or
worse  no matter how frightened or scared he might become he now again cannot get anybody to come or to hear or even know
about it  the discredited tube to prevent vicious or inspired bleeding in his suspicious trachea has left him completely alone 
worse off than a toddler that could at least bellow and yowl  rattling the bars of its playpen in terror that nobody tall was in any
shape to hear him  plus this dreadful time of weak gray late day light is the time  was the time when the sad and nerdily dressed
wraith appeared yesterday  assuming that was yesterday  assuming it was a real wraith  but the wraith  with its chinky coke and
theories of post mortem speed  had been able to interface with gately without aid of speech or gesture or bic  was why even out
of his mind gately had had to admit to himself it must have been a delusion  a fever dream  but he has to admit he d kind of liked
it  the dialogue  the give and take  the way the wraith could seem to get inside him  the way he said gately s best thoughts were
really communiques from the patient and abiding dead  gately wonders if his organic father the ironworker is not now maybe
dead and dropping in and standing very still from time to time for a communique  he felt slightly better  the room s ceiling was
not breathing  it lay flat as a stucco sheet  rippling only slightly with the petroleum fumes of fever and gately s own smell  then
bubbling up out of nowhere again he suddenly confronts deep focus memories of gene fackelmann s final demise and gately and
pamela hoffman jeep s involvement in fackelmann s demise 
gately  for several months before he did his state assault bit  was disastrously involved with one pamela hoffman jeep  his
first girl ever with a hyphen  a sort of upscale but directionless and not very healthy and pale and incredibly passive danvers girl
that worked in purchasing for a hospital supply co  in swampscott and was pretty definitely an alcoholic and drank bright drinks
with umbrellas in rte    clubs in the late p m  until she swooned and passed out with a loud clunk  that s what she called it  
 swooned   the swooning and passing out with a loud clunk as her head hit the table was more or less a nightly thing  and pamela
hoffman jeep fell automatically in love with any man she termed  chivalrous        enough to carry her out to the parking lot
and drive her home without raping her  which rape of an unconscious head lolling girl she termed  taking advantage    gately got
introduced to her by fackelmann  who one time as he came up through a sports bar called the pourhouse s parking lot to dialogue
with a sorkin debtor gately saw fackelmann staggering along carrying this unconscious girl to his ride  one big hand quite a bit
farther up her prom looking taffeta gown than it really needed to be to carry her  and fackelmann told gately if don d give this
gash a ride home he d stay and do the collection  which gately s heart wasn t in collections anymore and he jumped at the trade  as
long as fackelmann could promise him she could hold her various fluids in the  x  he was driving  so it was fackelmann who
told him  as he put the tiny and limp but still continent body in his arms in the parking lot of the pourhouse  to watch his personal
six  gately  and be sure and violate her a little  because this gash here was like one of those south sea culture gashes in that if
gately took her home and she woke up nonviolated she d be gately s for life  but gately obviously had no intention of raping an
unconscious person  much less even putting his hand up the gown of a girl that might lose her fluids any second  and this locked
him into the involvement  pamela hoffman jeep called gately her  night errand  and fell passively in love with his refusal to
take advantage  gene fackelmann  she confided  was not the gentleman gately was 
what helped make the involvement disastrous was that pamela hoffman jeep was always either so leglessly drunk or so
passively hungover all the time that any sort of sex any time at all with her would have classified as taking advantage 
this girl was the single passivest person gately ever met  he never once saw p h  j  actually get from one spot to another
under her own power  she needed somebody chivalrous to pick her up and carry her and lay her back down           it seemed
like  she was a sort of sexual papoose  she spent most of her life passed out and sleeping  she was a beautiful sleeper  kittenish
and serene  never drooling  she made passivity and unconsciousness look kind of beautiful  fackelmann called her death s posterchild  even at work  at the hospital supply co   gately imagined her horizontal  curled fetal on something soft  with all the hot
slack facial intensity of a sleeping baby  he imagined her bosses and coworkers all tiptoeing around purchasing whispering to
each other to not wake her up  she never once rode in the actual front seat of any vehicle he drove her home in  but she also never
threw up or pissed herself or even complained  just smiled and yawned an infant s little milky yawn and snuggled deeper into
whatever gately had swaddled her in  gately started doing that thing about yelling they d been robbed when he carried her into
whatever stripped luxury apt  they were crewing in  p h  j  wasn t what you d call great looking  but she was incredibly sexy 
gately felt  because she always managed to look like you d just x d her into a state of total unmuscled swoon  lying there
unconscious  trent kite told fackelmann he thought gately was out of his fucking mind  fax observed that kite himself was not
exactly a w  t  sherman with the ladies  even with coke whores and strung out nursing students and dipsoid lounge hags whose
painted faces swung loose from their heads  fackelmann claimed to have started a log just to keep track of kite s attempted
pickup lines   surefire lines like e g   you re the second most beautiful woman i ve ever seen  the first most beautiful woman i ve
ever seen being former british prime minister margaret thatcher   and  if you came home with me i m unusually confident that i
could achieve an erection   and said that if kite wasn t still cherry at twenty three and a half it was proof of some kind of divinetype grace 

 sometimes gately would come out of a demerol nod and look at pale passive pamela lying there sleeping beautifully and
undergo a time lapse clairvoyant thing where he could almost visibly watch her losing her looks through her twenties and her face
starting to slide over off her skull onto the pillow she held like a stuffed toy  becoming a lounge hag right before his eyes  the
vision aroused more compassion than horror  which gately never even considered might qualify him as a decent person 
gately s two favorite things about pamela hoffman jeep were  the way she would come out of her stupor and hold her cheek
and laugh hysterically each time gately carried her across the threshold of some stripped apartment and bellow that they d been
ripped off  and the way she always wore the long white linen gloves and bare shoulder taffeta that made her seem like some
upscale north shore debutante who s had like one too many dippers of country club punch and is just begging to be taken
advantage of by some low rent guy with a tattoo   she d make a sort of languid very slow motion bullwhip gesture with her
hand in the long white glove as she lay wherever gately had deposited her and simper out with an upscale inflection  don honey 
bring mommy a highball   she called a drink a highball   which it turned out was a deadly impression of her own mom  who it
turned out this lady made gately s own mom look like carry nation by comparison  lush wise  the only four times gately ever
met mrs  h  j  were all at e r s and sanitaria 
gately lies there pop eyed with guilt and anxiety in the hiss and click of resumed sleet  in the twilit st  e  s room  next to the
glittering back brace and skull halo thing clamped exoskeletally to the empty next bed and gleaming dully at selected welds 
gately trying to abide  remembering  it had been pamela hoffman jeep that finally clued gately in on the little ways gene
fackelmann had been historically getting over on whitey sorkin  and alerted him to the suicidal creek fackelmann had got
himself into with a certain mistaken bet scam that had blown up right in his map  even gately had been able to tell something was
the matter  for the last two weeks fackelmann had been squatting sweatily in a corner of the stripped living room  right outside the
little luxury bedroom gately and pamela were lying in  out there squatting over his sterno cooker and incredible twin hills of skyblue dilaudid and many hued m m s  not much speaking or responding or moving or even seeming to cop a nod  just sitting
there hunched and plump and glistening like some sort of cornered toad  his mustache flailing around on his lip  things would
have had to be bad indeed for gately ever to try to get coherent data out of p h  j  apparently the deal was that one of the bettors
that bet with sorkin through fackelmann was a guy gately and fackelmann know only as eighties bill  an impeccably groomed
guy that wore red suspenders under snazzy zegna brand menswear and tortoiseshell specs and docksiders  an old fashioned
corporate take overer and asset plunderer  maybe fifty  with an exchange place office and a souvenir free milken bumper
sticker on his beamer   it was a night of many highballs and much papoosing  and gately had to keep flicking the top of p h  j  s
skull to keep her conscious long enough to free associate her way through the details   who was on his fourth marriage to his
third aerobics instructor  and who liked to bet only on ivy league college hoops  but who when he did so   bet   bet amounts so
huge that fackelmann always had to get sorkin s pre approval on the bet and then call eighties bill back  and so on 
but so   according to pamela hoffman jeep   this eighties bill  who s a yale alum and usually unabashedly sentimental
about what pamela h  j  laughingly says fackelmann called his  almometer    well  on this particular time it seems like a little
impeccably groomed birdie has whispered in eighties bill s hairy ear  because this one time eighties bill wants to put     k
down on brown u  against yale u   i e  betting against his almome ter  only he wants      points instead of the even spread sorkin
and the rest of the boston books are taking off the atlantic city line for a spread  and fackelmann has to cell phone down to
saugus to bounce this off sorkin  except sorkin s down in the city in enfield at the national cranio facial pain foundation office
getting his weekly uv bombardment and cafergot refill from dr  robert   sixties bob   monroe   the septuagenarian pinksunglasses and nehru jacket wearing n c  f p f  ergotic vascular headache treatment specialized  a guy who in yore days
interned at sandoz and was one of t  leary s original circle of mayonnaise jar acid droppers at t  leary s now legendary house in
west newton ma  and is now    s b   an intimate acquaintance of kite  because sixties bob is an even bigger grateful dead
fanatic maybe even than kite  and sometimes got together with kite and several other dead devotees  most of who now had canes
and o  tanks  and traded historical souvenir type tiger s eyes and paisley doublets and tie dyes and lava lamps and bandannas and
plasma spheres and variegated black light posters of involuted geometric designs  and argued about which dead shows and
bootlegs of dead shows were the greatest of all time in different regards  and just basically had a hell of a time    s b   an
inveterate collector and haggling trader of shit  sometimes took kite along on little expeditions of eclectic and seedy shops for
dead related paraphernalia  sometimes even informally fencing stuff for kite  and so indirectly gately   covering kite with  
when kite s rigid need schedule didn t permit a more formal and time consuming fence  sixties bob then trading the merchandise
around various seedy locales for   s related shit nobody else d even usually want  a couple times gately had to actually finger an
ice cube out of a highball and slip it under the shoulderless neckline of p h  j  s prom gown to try and keep her on some kind of
track  like most incredibly passive people  the girl had a terrible time ever separating details from what was really important to a
story  is why she rarely ever got asked anything  but so the point is that the person that took fackelmann s call about eighties
bill s mammoth yale brown bet wasn t in fact sorkin but rather sorkin s secretary  one gwendine o shay  the howitzer breasted
old green cardless former i r a  moll who d gotten hit on the head with a truncheon by a godless belfast bobbie once too often
back on the old sod  and whose skull now was  in fackelmann s own terminology  soft as puppy shit in the rain  but who had just
the seedy sort of distracted grandmotherly air that makes her perfect for clapping her red knuckled old hands to her cheeks and
squealing as she claimed mass lottery lottery winnings whenever whitey sorkin and his ma statehouse bagmen cronies arrange
to have a sorkinite buy a mysteriously winning mass lottery ticket from one of the countless convenience stores sorkin   cronies
own through dummy corporations all up and down the north shore  and who  because she could not only give what sorkin
claimed was the only adequate cervical massage west of the berne hot alp springs center but also could both word process a
shocking     wpm and wield a shillelagh like nobody s business   plus had been w  sorkin s dear late i r a  moll mum s
scrabble pal back in belfast  on the old sod   served as whitey s chief administrative aide  manning the cellular phones when
sorkin was out or indisposed 
and so but p h  j  s point  which gately has to just about crack her scalp open flicking out of her  gwendine o shay  familiar
with eighties bill and his y u  bulldog sentimentality  plus cranially soft as a fucking grape  o shay took fackelmann s call
wrong  thought fackelmann said eighties bill wanted    k with      points on yale instead of      on brown  put fackelmann on
hold and made him listen to irish muzak while she put in a call to a yale athletic dept  mole out of sorkin s read protected

 database s mole file and learned that the yale u  bulldogs  star power forward had been diagnosed with an extremely rare
neurologic disorder called post coital vestibulitis       in which for several hours after intercourse the power forward tended to
suffer such a terrible vertiginous loss of proprioception that he literally couldn t tell his ass from his elbow  much less make an
authoritative move to the bucket  plus then o shay s second call  to sorkin s brown u  athletic mole  a locker room attendant
everybody thinks is deaf   reveals that several of brown u  s most sirenish and school spirited hetero coeds had been recruited 
auditioned  briefed  rehearsed  i e   debriefed   giggles pamela hoffman jeep  whose giggles involve the sort of ticklish shoulderwrithing undulations of a much younger girl getting tickled by an authority figure and pretending not to like it   and stationed at
strategic points       rest stops  in the spare tire compartment at the rear of the bulldogs  chartered bus  in the evergreen
shrubbery outside the teams  special entrance to the pizzitola athl  center in providence  in concave recesses along the pizzitola
tunnels between special entrance and visitors  locker room  even in a specially enlarged and sensually appointed locker next to the
power forward s locker in the vlr  all prepared   like the brown cheerleaders and pep squad  who ve been induced to do the
game pantyless  electrolysized and splits prone to help lend a pyrotechnic glandular atmosphere to the power forward s whole
playing environment   prepared to make the penultimate sacrifice for squad  school  and influential members of the brown
alumni bruins boosters assoc  so that gwendine o shay then switches back to fackelmann and oks the mammoth bet and
point spread  as like who wouldn t  with that kind of mole reported fix in the works  except of course she s taken the wager
backwards  i e  o shay thinks eighties bill s now got    k on yale coming within two points  while eighties bill   who it turns
out s cast himself as white knight in bidding for majority control of providence s federated funnel and cone corp   o n a n  s
leading manufacturer of conoid receptacles  with f f  c  ceo d by a prominent brown alumnus so rabid a bruins booster he
actually wears a snarling hollow bear head to conference games  whose ass eighties bill is going about kissing like nobody s
beeswax  p h  j  inserts  hinting it was eighties bill who d tipped the bruins staff off about the power forward s achilles  vas
deferens   e b  quite reasonably believes he s now got brown within a deuce for     el grande s 
the wrench in the ointment that nobody in providence has counted on is the picket and knuckleduster wielding appearance of
brown university s entire dworkinite female objectification prevention and protest phalanx outside the pizzitola athl  center s
main gates right at game time  two foppps per motorcycle  who blow through the filigreed gates like they were so much wet
kleenex and storm the arena  plus a division of brown s pluckier undergraduate n o w s who execute a pincer movement down
from the cheap seats up top during the first time out  at the precise moment the brown cheerleaders  first pyramid maneuver ends
in a mid air split that causes the pizzitola s scoreboard s scorekeeper to reel backward against his controls and blow out both
home s and visitors  zeroes  on the board  just as the foppps  unmuffled hawgs come blatting malevolently down through
the ground level tunnels and out onto the playing floor  and in the ensuing melee not only are cheerleaders  pep squad  and
comely brown u  sirens all either laid out with picket signs wielded like shillelaghs or thrown kicking and shrieking over the
burly shoulders of militant foppps and carried off on roaring hawgs  leaving the yale power forward s delicate nervous system
intact if overheated  but two brown u  bruin starters  a center and a shooting guard   both too wrung out and dazed by a
grueling week of comely siren auditioning and  rehearsing to have sense enough to run like hell once the melee spills out onto the
pizzitola hardwood   are felled  by a foppp knuckleduster and a disoriented referee with a martial arts background 
respectively  and so when the floor is finally cleared and stretchers borne off and the game resumes  yale u  cleans brown u  s
clock by upwards of    
then so fackelmann calls up eighties bill and arranges to pick up the skeet  which is          with the vig  which e b  gives
him in large denomination pre o n a n  scrip in a go brown bruins gym bag he d brought to the game to sit next to the
ursine headed ceo with and now has less than no use for  but so fackelmann receives the skeet downtown and blasts up cheesy
route   to saugus to deliver the skeet and pick up his vig on the vig       u s   right away  needing to cop blues in what s
starting to be the worst way  etc  plus fackelmann s figuring on maybe a small bonus or at least some emotional validation from
sorkin for bringing in such a mammoth and promptly remitted wager  but  when he gets to the rte    titty bar at the rear of which
sorkin has his administrative offices behind an unmarked fire door and all wallpapered in stuff that looks like ersatz wood
panelling  gwendine o shay wordlessly points behind her station at sorkin s personal office door with a terse gesture fackelmann
doesn t think fits with the up beatness of the occasion at all  the door s got a big poster of r  limbaugh on it  from before the
assassination  sorkin s in there working spreadsheets with his special monitor screen light filtering goggles on  the goggles 
lenses on their long protruding barrels look like lobsters 
eyes on stalks  gately and fackelmann and bobby c never spoke to sorkin until spoken to  not out of henchmanish obsequity
but because they could never tell what sorkin s cranio facial vascular condition was or if he could tolerate sound until they
verifiably heard him tolerating his own   sound   so g  fackelmann waits wordlessly to hand over eighties bill s skeet  standing
there tall and soft and palely sweating  the overall shape and color of a peeled boiled egg  when sorkin hikes an eyebrow at the
go bruins bag and says the knee slapping hilarity of the joke escapes him  fack elmann s mustache positively takes off all over
his upper lip  and he prepares to say what he always says when he s flummoxed  that whatever s being said is with all due respect a
goddamn lie  sorkin saves his data and pushes his desk chair back so he can reach all the way down to the fireproof drawer  the
goggles are often used in data processing sweatshops and list for a deuce  sorkin grunts as he hauls out a huge old mass lottery
box for quik pick cards and heaves it onto the desk  where it bulges obscenely  filled with      k u s    there s       fucking k
in there  all in ones     k minus vig  what sorkin via o shay believes to be eighties bill s winnings  all in small bills  because
sorkin s pissed off and can t resist making a little like gesture  fackelmann doesn t say anything  his mustache goes limp as his
mental machinery starts revving  sorkin  massaging his temples  staring up at fackelmann with his goggles like a crab in a tank 
says he supposes he can t blame fax or o shay  that he d have ok d the bet himself  what with the neurologic tip on the yale
forward they had  who could have foreseen thuggish feminazis screwing up the ointment  he utters a bit of gaelic that
fackelmann doesn t know but assumes to be fatalistical  he peels six c notes and an o n a n ite    spot off a wad the size of an
artillery shell and pushes them across the metal desk at fackelmann  his vig on the vig  he says what the fuck  sorkin does   this
eighties bill kid s irrational sentimentalism for yale will sooner or later catch up with him  veteran books tend to be statistically
philosophical and patient  fackelmann doesn t even bother to wonder why sorkin refers to eighties bill as  kid  when they re both
about the same age  but a high watt bulb is slowly beginning to incandesce over fackelmann s moist head  as in the faxter starts

 to conceptualize the overall concept of what must of happened  he still hasn t said anything  pamela hoffman jeep emphasizes 
sorkin looks fackelmann over and asks if he s gained some asymmetrical type weight  there  fackelmann s left tit does look
noticeably bigger than his right  under his sport coat  because of the legal envelope with         s and one     in it  the skeet
from an eighties bill who thought he d lost  just like sorkin thought e b  d won  the slight high whine in the room that sorkin
thinks is his infernatron disk drive is really the whine of fackelmann s high speed mentation  his mustache roils like a cracked
whip as he works his own internal mental spreadsheet    ok in one lumpy sum represented like     sky blue grams of
hydromorphone hydrochloride       or like           mg  soluble tablets of the shit  available from a certain rapacious but
discreet chinatown opiate dealer who d only deal synthetic narcs in     gram weights   which all translated  assuming kite
could be persuaded to pack up his d e c       and move far far away with fackelmann to help him set up a street distribution
matrix in some urban market far far away  into close to like let s see carry the one like     million in street value  which sum
meant that fackelmann and to a lesser jr  partner extent kite could have their chins on their chests for the rest of their days
without ever having to strip another apt   forge another passport  break another thumb  all if fackelmann just kept his map shut
about o shay s confabulation of yale  brown  brown yale  mumbled something about an i v  adulterant causing a sudden and
temporary gigantism in one tit  and blasted out of there straight down rte    to this one dr  wo and associates  hung toy s cold
tea emporium  chinatown 
by this time pamela hoffman jeep had succumbed to the highballs and her own swaddled warmth and was irreversibly
swooned  ice or fillip or no  twitching synaptically and murmuring to somebody named monty that he was certainly no kind of
gentleman in her book  but gately could chart the rest of fackelmann s shit creek s course for himself  when approached by
fackelmann with a go brown gym bag of dr  wo s finest wholesale dilaudid and invited to decamp with him and set up a
distrib matrix for their own drug empire far far away  kite would have staggered back in horror at fackelmann s obviously not
knowing that the bettor eighties bill was in fact none other than the son of sixties bob  viz  whitey sorkin s personal
migrainologist  who sorkin trusted and confided in as only a massive i v  dose of cafergot can make you trust and confide  and
whom sorkin would undoubtedly tell all about the guy s own son s huge win on yale  and who wasn t like ward and wally close
with his son  sixties bob wasn t  but naturally kept distant paternal tabs on him  and would certainly have known that e b  d in
fact bet brown in an attempt to cozy up to the conic ceo  and so would know that there d been some kind of mix up  and also that
 kite d still be staggering back in horror as all this added up  plus  even if sorkin somehow didn t get told of eighties bill s loss
and fackelmann s scam from sixties bill  the fact was that sorkin s newest savagest u s  muscle  bobby   c   c  old fashioned
smack addict  copped regular old organic burmese heroin from this dr  wo on a regular basis  and was sure to hear about     
grams of wholesale dilaudid bought by a fackelmann known to be c s co employee off sorkin       and thus that fackelmann  who
when he came to kite with the proposition was already in possession of a brown booster bag full of           mg  dilaudids and
minus sorkin s   ok   plus with as gately later knew only   k in suicidal scam backfire insurance capital   was already
dead  fackelmann was a dead man  kite would have said  staggering back with horror at fax s idiocy  kite d have said he could
smell fackejmann already biodegrading from here  dead as a fucking post  he d have told fackelmann  already worrying about
being seen sitting there with him in whatever titty bar they were in when fax hit kite with the proposal  and gately  watching
p h  j  sleep  could not only imagine but identify fully with how fackelmann  on hearing kite say he could smell him dead and
why  with how fackelmann  instead of taking his bagful of blues and gluing on a goatee and immediately fleeing to climes that d
never even fucking heard of metro boston s north shore   that the fax ter d done what any drug addict in possession of his
substance would do when faced with fatal news and attendant terror  facklemann d made a fucking beeline for their luxurystripped home and familiar safe feeling hearth and had plopped down and immediately fired up the sterno cooker and cooked up
and tied off and shot up and nailed his chin to his chest and kept it there with staggering quantities of dilaudid  trying to mentally
blot out the reality of the fact that he was going to get demapped if he didn t take some kind of decisive remedial action at once 
because  gately realized even then  this was your drug addict s basic way of dealing with problems  was using the good old
substance to blot out the problem  also probably medicating his terror by stuffing himself with peanut m m s  which would explain all the wrappers littering the floor of the corner he hadn t moved from  that thus this is why fackelmann has been squatting
moist and silent in a corner of the living room right outside this very bedroom here for days  this was why the apparent
contradiction of the staggering amount of substance fackelmann had in the gym bag next to him together with the cornered toad
look of a man in the great fear one associates with withdrawal  charting and thinking  drumming his fingers absently on p h  j  s
unconscious skull  gately realized he could more than empathize with fackelmann s flight into dilaudid and m m s  but he now
realizes that that was the first time it really ever dawned on him in force that a drug addict was at root a craven and pathetic
creature  a thing that basically hides 
the most sexual thing gately ever did with pamela hoffman jeep was he liked to unwrap her cocoon of blankets and climb
in with her and spoon in real tight  fitting his bulk up close against all her soft concave places  and then go to sleep with his face in
her nape  it bothered gately that he could empathize with fackelmann s desire to hide and blot out  but in the retrospect of
memory now it bothers him more that he didn t lie there up next to the comatose girl being bothered for more than a few minutes
before he felt the familiar desire that blots out all bother  and that that night he had unwrapped the cocoon of bedding and arisen so
automatically in service of this desire  and feels the worst of all that he d lumbered out of the bedroom in just jeans and belt out to
the gloaming living room where fackelmann was hunched moist and smeary mouthed in the corner next to a mountain of    mg 
dilaudids and his mixing bowl of distilled water and works kit and sterno unit  that gately had lumbered so automatically out to
fackelmann under the pretense   to himself  too  the pretense  was the worst thing   the pretense that he was just going to check
on poor old fackelmann  to maybe try and convince him to take some kind of action  go penitent to sorkin or flee the clime
instead of just hiding there in the corner with his mind in neutral and his chin on his chest and a stalactite of chocolated drool from
his lower lip lengthening  because he knew that the first thing fackelmann would do when gately left p h  j  and lumbered out to
the defur nished living room would be to fumble in his goretex works kit for a new factory wrapped syringe and invite gately to
hunker on down and get right with the planet  i e  ingest some of this mountain of dilaudid  to keep fackelmann company  which
to gately s shame he did  had done  and no part of the reality of fackelmann s creek and the need for action had even been brought
up  so intent were they on the blues  somnolent hum  blotting everything out  while pamela hoffman jeep lay wrapped tight in the

 other room dreaming of damsels and towers   gately did  he remembers vividly  he let fackelmann fix them both up but good 
and told himself he was doing it to keep fackelmann company  like sitting up with a sick friend  and  maybe worst  believed it
was true 
little entr actes of feverish dreams punctuate memories and being conscious  like  he dreams he s riding due north on a bus
the same color as its own exhaust  passing again and again the same gutted cottages and expanse of heaving sea  weeping  the
dream goes on and on  without any kind of resolution or arrival  and he weeps and sweats as he lies there  stuck in it  gately
comes sharply around when he feels the little rough tongue on his forehead   not unlike nimitz the m p  s little pet kitten s
hesitant tongue  when the m p  had still had the kitten  before the mysterious period when the kitten disappeared and the garbage
disposal wouldn t run right for days and the m p  sat hungover with his notebook at the kitchen table with his blond head in his
hands  just sat there for several days  and gately s mom went around pale as hell and wouldn t go near the kitchen sink for days 
and rushed to the bathroom when gately finally asked what was the deal with the garbage disposal and where was nimitz  when
gately gets his eyelids unstuck  though  the tongue is not even close to being nimitz s  the wraith is back  right by the bed 
dressed like before and blurred at the edges in the hat shadowed spill of hallway light  and except now with him is another 
younger  way more physically fit wraith in kind of faggy biking shorts and a u s  tank top who s leaning way over gately s railing
and     fucking licking gately s forehead with a rough little tongue  and as gately reflexively strikes out at the guy s map   no
man put his tongue on d  w  gately and lived   he has just enough time to realize the wraith s breath has no warmth to it  or
smell  before both wraiths vanish and a blue forked bolt of pain from his sudden striking out sends him back against his hot pillow
with an arched spine and a tube impeded scream  his eyes rolling back into the dove colored light of whatever isn t quite sleep 
his fever is way worse  and his little snatches of dreams have a dismantled cubist aspect he associates in memory with
childhood flu  he dreams he looks in a mirror and sees nothing and keeps trying to clean the mirror with his sleeve  one dream
consists only of the color blue  too vivid  like the blue of a pool  an unpleasant smell keeps coming up his throat  he s both in a
bag and holding a bag  visitors flit in and out  but never ferocious francis or joelle van d  he dreams there s people in his room
but he s not one of them  he dreams he s with a very sad kid and they re in a graveyard digging some dead guy s head up and it s
really important  like continental emergency important  and gately s the best digger but he s wicked hungry  like irresistibly
hungry  and he s eating with both hands out of huge economy size bags of corporate snacks so he can t really dig  while it gets
later and later and the sad kid is trying to scream at gately that the important thing was buried in the guy s head and to divert the
continental emergency to start digging the guy s head up before it s too late  but the kid moves his mouth but nothing comes out 
and joelle van d  appears with wings and no underwear and asks if they knew him  the dead guy with the head  and gately starts
talking about knowing him even though deep down he feels panic because he s got no idea who they re talking about  while the
sad kid holds something terrible up by the hair and makes the face of somebody shouting in panic  too late 
she d come out of the st  e  s doors and turned right for the quick walk back up to ennet and a grotesquely huge woman
whose hose bulged with stubble and whose face and head were four times larger than the largest woman joelle had ever seen had
grabbed her arm at the elbow and said she was sorry to be the one to tell her but that unbeknownst to her she was in almost mindboggling danger 
it took rather a while for joelle to look her up and down   this is supposed to be news  
so and but that night s next a m  d found gately and fackelmann still there in fackelmann s little corner  belts around their
arms  arms and noses red from scratching  still at it  the ingestion  on a hell of a tear  cooking up and getting off and eating
m m s when they could find their mouths with their hands  moving like men deep under water  heads wobbling on strengthless
necks  the empty room s ceiling sky blue and bulging and under it hanging on the wall overhead to their right the apartment s
upscale tp s viewer on a recursive slo mo loop of some creepy thing fackelmann liked that was just serial shots of flames from
brass lighters  kitchen matches  pilot lights  birthday candles  votive candles  pillar candles  birch shavings  bunsen burners  etc  
that fackelmann had got from kite  who just before dawn had come out dressed and declined to get high with them and coughed
nervously and announced he had to leave for a few days or more for a  totally key  and unmissable software trade show in a
different area code  not knowing gately now knew he knew fackelmann already to be dead  w  kite then trying to leave discreetly
with every piece of hardware he owned in his arms  including the nonportable d e c   trailing cables  then a bit later  as the a m 
light intensified yellowly and made both gately and fackelmann curse the fact that the curtains had been stripped and pawned  as
they continued to hunch and cook and shoot  at maybe o  oh  pamela hoffman jeep was up and vomiting briskly and applying
mousse against the workaday day  calling gately honey and her night errand and asking if she d done anything last night she d
have to explain to anybody today   kind of an a m  routine in their relationship   applying blush and drinking her standard antihangover breakfast       and watching gately and fackel mann s chins fall and rise at slightly different underwater rates  the
smell of her perfume and high retsin mints hung in the bare room long after she d bid them both ciao bello  as the a m  sun got
higher and intolerable  instead of taking action and nailing a blanket or something over the window they opted instead to obliterate
the reality of the eye scalding light and began truly bingeing on blues  flirting with an o  d  they scaled fackelmann s mt 
dilaudid at a terrible clip  fackelmann was by nature a binger  gately was typically more like a maintenance user  he rarely went
on a classic type binge  which meant plunking down in one place with an enormous stash and getting loaded over and over again
for long periods without moving  but when he did start a binge he might as well have been strapped to the snout of a missile for
all the control he had over length or momentum  fackelmann was having at the mountain of    mg  blues like there was no
tomorrow  every time gately even started to bring up the issue of how faxter had come by such a huge blue haul of the substance
  trying maybe to invite fackelmann to confront the reality of his trouble by describing it  like   fackelmann would cut him off
with a soft  that s a goddamn lie   this was pretty much all fackelmann would ever say  when loaded  even in response to things
like questions  you have to picture all the binge s verbal exchanges as occurring like very slowly  oddly distended  as if the time
were honey 
 serious fucking stash you managed to come by somehow right here  fa  
 that s a goddamn lie  
 man  man  i just hope gwendine or c s got the phone today out there  man  instead of whitey  no business getting done out
of here today i don t thi  

  s a goddamn he  
 that s for sure  fax  
 s a goddamn lie  
 fax  the faxter  count faxula  
 goddamn lie  
after a while in all the distension it got to be like a joke  gately would haul his big head upright and try to allege the
roundness of the planet  the three dimensionality of the phenomenal world  the blackness of all black dogs  
 s a goddamn lie  
they found it increasingly funny  after every exchange like this they laughed and laughed  each exhalation of laughter
seemed to take several minutes  the ceiling and the window s light receded  fackelmann wet his pants  this was even funnier 
they watched the pool of urine spread out against the hardwood floor  changing shape  growing curved arms  exploring the fine
oak floor  the rises and valleys and little seams  it might of gotten later and then early a m  again  the entertainment cartridge s
myriad small flames were reflected in the spreading puddle  so that soon gately could watch without taking his chin off his chest 
when the phone rang it was just a fact  the ringing was like an environment  not a signal  the fact of its ringing got more and
more abstract  whatever a ringing phone might signify was like totally overwhelmed by the overwhelming fact of its ringing 
gately pointed this out to fackelmann  fackelmann vehemently denied it 
at some point gately tried to stand and was rudely assaulted by the floor  and wet his own pants 
the phone rang and rang 
at another point they got interested in rolling different colors of peanut m m s into the puddles of urine and watching the
colored dye corrode and leave a vampire white football of m m in a nimbus of bright dye 
the intercom s buzzer to the luxury apartment complex s glass doors downstairs sounded  overwhelming both of them with
the fact of its sound  it buzzed and buzzed  they discussed wishing it would stop the way you discuss wishing it would stop
raining 
it became the icbm of binges  the substance seemed inexhaustible  mt  dilaudid changed shapes but never really much
shrank that they could see  it was the first and only time ever that gately i v  d narcotics so many times in one arm that he ran out
of arm vein and had to switch to the other arm  fackelmann was no longer coordinated enough to help him tie off and boot 
fackelmann kept making a string of chocolaty drool appear and distend almost down to the floor  the acidity of their urine was
corroding the apt  s hardwood floor s finish in an observable way  the puddle had grown many arms like a hindu god  gately
couldn t quite tell if the urine had explored its way almost back to their feet or if they were already sitting in urine  fackel mann
would see how close to the surface of the pond of their mixed piss he could get the tip of the string of spit before he sucked it back
up and in  the little game had an intoxicating aura of danger to it  the insight that most people like play danger but don t like reallife danger hit gately like an epiphany  it took him gallons of viscous time to try and articulate the insight to fackelmann so that
fackelmann could give it the imprimatur of a denial 
eventually the buzzer stopped 
the phrase  more tattoos than teeth  also kept going through gately s head as it bobbed  the head   even though he had no idea
where the phrase came from or who it was supposed to refer to  he hadn t been to billerica minimum yet  he was on bail that
whitey sorkin had bonded 
the taste of the m m s couldn t cut the weirdly sweet medical taste of hydromorphone in gately s mouth  he watched an old
stovetop burner s crown of blue flame shimmer in the shine of the urine 
during a ruddled sunset light period fackelmann had had a small convulsion and a bowel movement in his pants and gately
hadn t had the coordination to go to fackelmann s side during the seizure  to help and just be there  he had the nightmarish feeling
that there was something crucial he had to do but had forgot what it was     mg  injections of the blue bayou kept the feeling at
bay for shorter and shorter periods  he d never heard of somebody having a convulsion from an o d   and fackelmann had indeed
seemed to bounce to his version of back 
the sun outside the big windows seemed to go up and down like a yo yo 
they ran out of the distilled water fackelmann had in the mixing bowl  and fackelmann took a cotton and sopped up candydyed urine off the floor and cooked up with urine  gately appeared to himself to be repulsed by this  but there was no question of
trying to get to the stripped kitchen for the distilled water bottle  gately was tying off his right arm with his teeth  now  his left
was so useless 
fackelmann smelled very bad 
gately nodded out into a dream where he was on a beverly needham bus whose sides said paragon bus lines  the
gray line  in his stu porous recall over four years later in st  e  s he realizes that this bus is the bus from the dream that
wouldn t end and wouldn t go anywhere  but has the sickening realization that the connection between the two buses is itself a
dream  or is in a dream  and it s now that his fever returns to new heights and his line on the heart monitor gets a funny little hitch
like a serration at the  st and  rd nodes  which makes an amber light flash at the nurse s station down the hall 
when the buzzer sounded again they were watching the flames film late at night  now poor old pamela hoffman jeep s voice
came to them through the intercom  the intercom and apt  complex front doors unlocker button were all the way across the living
room by the apartment door  the ceiling bulged and receded  fackelmann had made his hand into the shape of a claw and was
studying the claw in the light of the tp s flames  mt  dilaudid was badly caved in on one side  a disastrous avalanche into lake
urine was a possibility  p h  j  sounded drunk as a nuck  she said to let her in  she said she knew they were in there  she used
party as a verb several times  fackelmann was whispering that it was a lie  gately remembers he actually had to prod himself in
the bladder to feel if he had to go to the bathroom  his unit felt small and icy cold against his leg in the wet jeans  the ammoniac
smell of urine and the breathing ceiling and drunk distant female voice     gately reached in the dark for the bars of his playpen 
grasped them with pudgy fists  hauled himself to his feet  his rising was more like the floor lowering  he wobbled like a toddler 
the apt  floor below him feinted right  left  circling for an opening to attack  the luxury windows hung with starlight  fackelmann
had made his claw come alive into a spider and was letting the spider climb slowly down his chest area  the starlight was smeary 

 there were no distinct stars  everything out of the line of fire of the cartridge viewer was dark as a pocket  the buzzer sounded
angry and the voice pathetic  gately put his foot out in the direction of the buzzer  he heard fackelmann telling his hand s claw s
spider it was witnessing the birth of an empire  then when gately put his foot down there was nothing there  the floor dodged his
foot and rushed up at him  he caught a glimpse of bulged ceiling and then the floor caught him in the temple  his ears belled  the
impact of the floor against him shook the whole room  a box of laminates teetered and fell and fanned clear laminates all over the
wet floor  the viewer fell off the wall and cast ruddled flames on the ceiling  the floor jammed itself against gately  pressing in
tight  and he grayed out with his scrunched face toward fackelmann and the windows beyond  with fackelmann holding the
spider out in mid air at him for his inspection 
 oh for christ s sake then 
 i was in two scenes  what else is in there i do not know  in the first scene i m going through a revolving door  you know 
around in this glass revolving door  and going around out as i go in is somebody i know but apparently haven t seen for a long
time  because the recognition calls for a shocked look  and the person sees me and gives an equally shocked look   we re
supposedly formerly very close and now haven t seen each other in the longest time  and the meeting is random chance  and
instead of going in i keep going around in the door to follow the person out  which person is also still revolving in the door to
follow me in  and we whirl in the door like that for several whirls  
 q  
 the actor was male  he wasn t one of jim s regulars  but the character i recognize in the door is epicene  
 q  
 hermaphroditic  androgynous  it wasn t obvious that the character was supposed to be a male character  i assume you can
identify 
 the other had the camera bolted down inside a stroller or bassinet  i wore an incredible white floor length gown of some sort
of flowing material and leaned in over the camera in the crib and simply apologized  
 q  
 apologized  as in my lines were various apologies   i m so sorry  i m so terribly sorry  i am so  so sorry  please know how
very  very  very sorry i am   for a real long time  i doubt he used it all  i strongly doubt he used it all  but there were at least
twenty minutes of permutations of  i m sorry  
 q  
 not exactly  not exactly veiled  
 q  
 the point of view was from the crib  yes  a crib s eye view  but that s not what i mean by driving the scene  the camera was
fitted with a lens with something jim called i think an auto wobble  ocular wobble  something like that  a ball and socket joint
behind the mount that made the lens wobble a little bit  it made a weird little tiny whirring noise  i recollect  
 q  
 the mount s the barrel  the mount s what the elements of the lens are arranged in  this crib lens s mount projected out way
farther than a conventional lens  but it wasn t near as big around as a catadioptric lens  it looked more like an eye stalk or a nightvision scope than a lens  long and skinny and projecting  with this slight wobble  i don t know much about lenses beyond basic
concepts like length and speed  lenses were jim s forte  this can t be much of a surprise  he always had a whole case full  he paid
more attention to the lenses and lights than to the camera  his other son carried them in a special case  leith was cameras  the son
was lenses  lenses jim said were what he had to bring to the whole enterprise  of filmmaking  of himself  he made all his own  
 q  
 well i ve never been around them  but i know there s something wobbled and weird about their vision  supposedly  i think
the newer born they are  the more the wobble  plus i think a milky blur  neonatal nystagmus  i don t know where i heard that
term  i don t remember  it could have been jim  it could have been the son  what i know about infants personally you coujd   it
may have been an astigmatic lens  i don t think there s much doubt the lens was supposed to reproduce an infantile visual field 
that s what you could feel was driving the scene  my face wasn t important  you never got the sense it was meant to be captured
realistically by this lens  
 q  
 i never saw it  i ve got no idea  
 q  
 they were buried with him  the masters of everything unreleased  at least that was in his will  
 q  
 it had nothing to do with killing himself  less than nothing to do with it  
 q  
 no i never saw his fucking will  he told me  he told me things 
 he d stopped being drunk all the time  that killed him  he couldn t take it but he d made a promise  
 q  
 i don t know that he ever even got a finished master  that s your story  there wasn t anything unendurable or enslaving in
either of my scenes  nothing like these actual perfection rumors  these are academic rumors  he talked about making something
quote too perfect  but as a joke  he had a thing about entertainment  being criticized about entertainment v  nonen tertainment and
stasis  he used to refer to the work itself as  entertainments   he always meant it ironically  even in jokes he never talked about
an anti version or antidote for god s sake  he d never carry it that far  a joke  
     
 when he talked about this thing as a quote perfect entertainment  terminally compelling   it was always ironic   he was
having a sly little jab at me  i used to go around saying the veil was to disguise lethal perfection  that i was too lethally beautiful
for people to stand  it was a kind of joke i d gotten from one of his entertainments  the medusa odalisk thing  that even in
u h i d  i hid by hiddenness  in denial about the deformity itself  so jim took a failed piece and told me it was too perfect to

 release   it d paralyze people  it was entirely clear that it was an ironic joke  to me  
 q  
 jim s humor was a dry humor  
 q  
 if it got made and nobody s seen it  the master  it s in there with him  buried  that s just a guess  but i bet you  
     
 call it an educated bet    q  
     
 q  q  q  
 that s the part of the joke he didn t know  where he s buried is itself buried  now  it s in your annulation zone  it s not even
your territory  and now if you want the thing   he d enjoy the joke very much  i think  oh shit yes very much  
by a rather creepy coincidence  it turned out that  up in our room  kyle dempsy coyle and mario were also watching one of
himself s old efforts  mario had gotten his pants on and was using his special tool to zip and button  coyle looked oddly
traumatized  he was sitting on the edge of my bed  his eyes wide and his whole body with the slight tremble of something hanging
from the tip of a pipette  mario greeted me by name  snow continued to whirl and eddy outside the window  the position of the
sun was impossible to gauge  the net posts were now buried almost up to their scorecard attachments  the wind was piling snow
up in drifts against all academy right angles and then pummelling the drifts into unusual shapes  the window s whole view had
the gray grainy quality of a poor photo  the sky looked diseased  mario worked his tool with great patience  it often took him
several tries to catch and engage the tool s jaws on the tongue of his zipper  coyle  still wearing his apnea mouthguard  stared at
our room s little viewer  the cartridge was himself s accomplice   a short melodrama with cosgrove watt and a boy no one had
ever seen before or since 
 you woke up early   mario said  smiling up from his fly  his bed was made up drum tight 
i smiled   turns out i wasn t the only one  
 you look sad  
i raised my hand with the nasa glass at coyle   an unexpected pleasure  k d c  
 thtithe fickn meth   coyle said 
i put the glass and toothbrush on my dresser and straightened its doily  i picked some clothing up and began separating it by
smell into wearable and unwearable 
 kyle says jim troeltsch tore some of ortho s face off trying to pull him off a window his face got glued to   mario said   and
then jim troeltsch and mr  kenkle tried to put toilet tissue on the ripped parts  the way tall paul sometimes puts little bits of
kleenex on a shaving cut  but ortho s face was a lot worse than a shaving cut  and they used a whole roll  and now ortho s face is
covered with toilet tissue  and the tissue s stuck now  and ortho can t get it off  and at breakfast mr  delint was yelling at ortho
for letting them put toilet tissue on it  and ortho ran to his and kyle s room and locked the door  and kyle doesn t have his key
since the accident with the whirlpool  
i helped mario on with his police lock s vest and affixed the velcro nice and tight  mario s chest is so fragile feeling that i
could feel his heartbeat s tremble through the vest and sweatshirt 
coyle removed the apnea guard  strings of white nighttime oral material appeared between his mouth and the guard as he
extracted it  he looked to mario   tell him the worst part  
i was watching coyle very closely to see what he planned to do with the sickening mouthpiece he held 
 hey hal  your phone has messages  and mike pemulis came by and asked if you were up and about  
 you haven t told him the worst part of it   coyle said 
 don t even think about putting that thing down anywhere my bed  kyle  please  
tm holding it away from everything  don t worry  
mario used his tool to zip up the long curved zipper of his backpack   kyle said there was a problem with a discharge again  
 
 so i heard   i said 
   and kyle says he woke up and ortho was missing  and ortho s bed was missing as well  so he turned on the light   
coyle gestured with the appliance   and lo and fucking capital b behold  
  yes and lo   mario said   ortho s bed is up near the ceiling of their room  the frame has some way got lifted up and bolted
to the ceiling sometime during the night without kyle hearing it or waking up  
 until the discharge  that is   i said 
this is it   said coyle  the tin cans and accusations i m moving his stuff around are one thing  i m going to lateral alice for a
switch like troeltsch did  this is the straw  
mario said  and his bed s up on the ceiling now  still  and if it falls it s going to go right through the floor and fall in graham
and petropolis s room  
 he s in there right now all mummified in toilet paper  sulking  with his bed hanging overhead  with the door locked  so i can t
even get my apnea guard cleaning supplies   coyle said 
i d heard nothing about troeltsch apparently switching room assignments with trevor axford  a gigantic wedge of snow slid
down a steep part of the roof over our window and fell past the window and hit the ground below with a huge whump  for some
reason the fact that something as major as a midterm room switch could have taken place without my knowing anything about it
filled me with dread  there were a few glitters of a possible incipient panic attack again 
mario s bedside table had a tube of salve for his pelvis s burn  unevenly squeezed  mario was looking at my face   is it you re
sad about not getting to play if the quebec players are canceled  
 and then to crown off the whole night he ends up with his face glued to a window   coyle said disgustedly 
 frozen   i corrected him 
 except but now listen to stice s explanation  

  let me guess   i said 
 for the bed hovering  
mario looked at coyle   you said bolted  
 i said presumably bolted is what i said  i said the only rationale that s possible is bolts  
 let me guess   i said 
 let him guess   mario told coyle 
 the darkness thinks ghosts   coyle stood and came toward us  his two eyes were not set quite level in his face   slice s
explanation that he swore me to discretion but that was before the bed on the ceiling was he thinks he s been somehow selected or
chosen to get haunted or possessed by some kind of beneficiary or guardian ghost that resides in and or manifests in ordinary
physical objects  that wants to teach the darkness how to not underestimate ordinary objects and raise his game to like a
supernatural level  to help his game   one eye was subtly lower than the other  and set at a different angle 
 or hurt somebody else s   i said 
 stice is mentally buckling   coyle said  still moving in  i was careful to stay just out of morning breath range   he keeps
staring at things with his temple veins flexing  trying to exert will on them  he bet me    beans he could stand on his desk chair
and lift it up at the same time  and then he wouldn t let me cancel the bet when i got embarrassed for him after half an hour 
standing up there flexing his temples  
i was also keeping a careful eye on the oral appliance   did you guys hear sausage analog and fresh squeezed for breakfast  
mario asked again if i were sad 
coyle said  i was down there  stice s map was taking the edge off appetites all over the room  then delint started in yelling at
him   he was looking at me oddly   i don t see what s so funny about it  man  
mario fell backward onto his bed and wriggled into his backpack s straps with practiced ease 
coyle said  i don t know if i should go to schtitt  or rusk  or what  or lateral alice  what if they haul him off somewhere 
and it s my fault  
 there s no denying the dark s raised his game this fall though  
 there are machine messages on the machine  hal  too   mario said as i held his hands carefully and pulled him upright 
 what if it s the mental buckling that s raised his game   coyle said   does it still count as buckling  
cosgrove watt had been one of the very few professional actors himself ever used  himself often liked to use rank amateurs 
he wanted them simply to read their lines with an amateur s wooden self consciousness off cue cards mario or disney leith would
hold up well to the side of wherever the character was supposed to be looking  up until the last phase of his career  himself had
apparently thought the stilted  wooden quality of nonprofes sionals helped to strip away the pernicious illusion of realism and to
remind the audience that they were in reality watching actors acting and not people behaving  like the parisian french bresson he
so admired  himself had no interest in suckering the audience with illusory realism  he said  the apparent irony of the fact that it
required nonactors to achieve this stilted artificial i m only acting here quality was one of very few things about himself s early
projects that truly interested academic critics  but the real truth was that the early himself hadn t wanted skilled or believable
acting to get in the way of the abstract ideas and technical innovations in the cartridges  and this had always seemed to me more
like brecht than like bresson  conceptual and technical ingenuity didn t much interest entertainment film audiences  though  and
one way of looking at himself s abandonment of anticonfluentialism is that in his last several projects he d been so desperate to
make something that ordinary u s  audiences might find entertaining and diverting and conducive to self forgetting       that he
had had professionals and amateurs alike emoting wildly all over the place  getting emotion out of either actors or audiences had
never struck me as one of himself s strengths  though i could remember arguments during which mario had claimed i didn t see a
lot of what was right there 
cosgrove watt was a pro  but he wasn t very good  and before himself discovered him  watt s career consisted mostly of
regional market commercials on broadcast television  his widest commercial exposure was as the dancing gland in a series of
spots for a chain of east coast endocrinology clinics  he d worn a bulbous white costume  white toupee  and either a ball andchain or white tap shoes  depending on whether he was portraying the before gland or the after gland  himself during one of
these commercials had shouted eureka at our hd sony and travelled personally all the way to glen riddle  pennsylvania  where
watt lived with his mother and her cats  to recruit him  he used cosgrove watt in almost every project for eighteen months  watt
for a time was to himself as deniro was to scorsese  mclachlin to lynch  allen to allen  and up until watt s temporal lobe
problem made his social presence unbearable  himself had actually put watt  mother  and cats up in a contiguous suite of what
later became prorectors  rooms off the main e t a  tunnel  the moms acquiescing in this but instructing orin  mario  and me never
ever to remain in a room alone with watt 
accomplice  was one of watt s later roles  it is a sad and simple cartridge  and so short that the tp retracked to the film s
beginning in almost no time  himself s film opens as a beautifully sad young bus station male prostitute  fragile and epicene and
so blond even his eyebrows and lashes are blond  is approached in the greyhound coffee shop by a flabby  dissipated looking old
specimen with gray teeth and circumflex eyebrows and obvious temporal lobe difficulties  cosgrove watt plays the depraved
older man  who takes the boy home to his lush but somehow scuzzy co op apartment  in fact the place himself had rented for o 
and the p g o a t  and had decorated in various gradations of scuz for the interiors of almost all his late projects 
the sad and beautiful aryan looking boy agrees to seduction by the dissipated old specimen  but only on the condition that
the man wear protection  the boy  who is inarticulate  nevertheless makes this stipulation extremely clear  safe sex or no sex  he
stipulates  holding up a familiar foil packet  the hideous old specimen   now in a smoking jacket and ascot of apricot colored
silk  and smoking through a long white fdr style filter   is offended  thinks the young male prostitute has sized him up as such
a depraved and dissipated old specimen that he might well have it  the human immuno virus  he thinks  his thoughts are rendered
via animated thought bubbles  which himself at that late middle stage hoped the audience would find at once self consciously
nonillusory and wildly entertaining  watt s old specimen is grinning grayly in what he thinks is a pleasant way as he obligingly
takes the foil packet and removes his ascot with what he believes to be a sensual flourish     but inside his thought bubble he s
having temporal lobe spasms of sadistic rage at the sad blond boy for appearing to size him up as a health risk  the obvious health

 risk here is referred to  both orally and in the thought bubble  merely as it  for example   little bastard thinks i m so dissipatedlooking that i ve been at this sort of thing so long that i m likely to have it  does he   the old specimen thinks  his thought bubble
going all jagged with rage 
so the flabby old specimen s now  at only six minutes into the cartridge  track      he s now taking the sad beautiful boy  in
the standard  extravagantly hunched  homosexual way  on the canopied bed of his tacky boudoir  the young male prostitute s
dutifully assumed the hunched  homo submissive position because the old ponce has showed him he s wearing the condom  the
young prostitute  who s shown  hunched  only from the left side during the act itself  seems beautiful in a fragile  skinny flanked 
visible ribs way  while the old specimen has the slack ass and pointy little breasts of a man made grotesque by years of
dissipation  the intercourse scene is done under bright lamps  without any sort of soft focus or light jazz background score to
lighten the atmosphere of clinical detachment 
what the sad blond submissive boy doesn t know is that the dissipated old specimen had secretly palmed an old fashioned
one sharp sided razor blade when he d gone into his burgundy tiled bathroom to gargle with cinnamon mouthwash and dab calvin
klein brand pheromonic musk on his flabby pulse points  and as he hunches animalistically over the boy  he s holding the
business end of the blade right up next to the sad boy s anus as he takes his pleasure  so that the blade s sharp side slices into both
condom and erect phallus on each outthrust  the hideous old specimen unmindful of the blood and whatever pain s involved in the
phallic slicing as  still hunched and thrusting  he peels the slit condom off like the skin of a sausage  the young male prostitute 
hunched submissively  feels the condom peel and then the blood and starts struggling like a condemned man  trying to get the
condomless bleeding flabby old specimen out and off of him  but the boy s thin and delicate  and the old man has no trouble
holding him down with his soft slack flabby weight until he s grimaced and grunted and taken his pleasure to its end  it s
apparently an explicit homosexual sex scene convention that whoever takes the submissive hunched position keeps his face
turned away from the camera while the dominant partner s phallus is inside him  and himself honors this convention  though a
self conscious footnote subtitled along the bottom of the screen rather irritatingly points out that the scene is honoring a
convention  the prostitute turns his agonized face around to the camera only after the depraved older homosexual has removed his
bloody and deflating post pleasure phallus  brings his blond browed face around to his left to face the audience in a mute howl as
he collapses onto his delicate chest with his arms out on the satin sheets and his violated bum hiked high in the air  revealing now
at the crease of his bum and upper hamstring a vivid purple splotch  more vivid than any bruise and with eight spidery tentacles
radiating from it that are  the older man s horrified thought bubble reveals  the unmistakable eight legged vivid contusion blotch
sign of kaposi s sarcoma  that most universal symptom of it  and the boy is sobbing that the depraved old homosexual has made
him   the prostitute   a murderer  the boy s racking sobs making the hiked bum waggle in front of the old specimen s horrified
face as the boy sobs into the chartreuse satin and shrieks  murderer  murderer   over and over  so that almost a third oi
accomplice  s total length is devoted to the racked repetition of this word   way  way longer than is needed for the audience to
absorb the twist and all its possible implications and meanings  this was just the sort of issue mario and i argued about  as i see
it  even though the cartridge s end has both characters emoting out of every pore  accomplice    essential project remains abstract
and self reflexive  we end up feeling and thinking not about the characters but about the cartridge itself  by the time the final
repetitive image darkens to a silhouette and the credits roll against it and the old man s face stops spasming in horror and the boy
shuts up  the cartridge s real tension becomes the question  did himself subject us to     seconds of the repeated cry  murderer  
for some reason  i e  is the puzzlement and then boredom and then impatience and then excruciation and then near rage
aroused in the film s audience by the static repetitive final     of the film aroused for some theoretical aesthetic end  or is himself
simply an amazingly shitty editor of his own stuff 
it was only after himself s death that critics and theorists started to treat this question as potentially important  a woman at u 
cal irvine had earned tenure with an essay arguing that the reason versus no reason debate about what was unentertaining in
himself s work illuminated the central conundra of millennial apres garde film  most of which  in the teleputer age of home only
entertainment  involved the question why so much aesthetically ambitious film was so boring and why so much shitty reductive
commercial entertainment was so much fun  the essay was turgid to the point of being unreadable  besides using reference as a
verb and pluralizing conundrum as conundra       
from my horizontal position on the bedroom floor i could use the tp s remote to do everything but actually remove and insert
cartridges into the drive s dock  the room s window was now a translucent clot of snow and steam  interlace s spontaneous
disseminations for new new england were all about weather  with our subscription system  e t a  got numerous large market
spontaneous tracks  each track took a slightly different angle on the weather  each track had a slightly different focus  remote
reports from boston s north and south shores  providence  new haven  and hartford springfield served to establish a consensus
that a terrific amount of snow had fallen and was continuing to fall and blow around and pile up  cars were shown abandoned at
hasty angles  and we got to see the universal white vw bug shape of snow buried cars  black helmeted gangs of adolescents on
snowmobiles were shown prowling new haven s streets  clearly up to no good  pedestrians were shown bent over and
floundering  remote report journalists were shown trying to flounder over to them to get their thoughts and reflections  one
floundering reporter in quincy on the south shore abruptly disappeared from view except for a hand with a microphone
protruding bravely from some sort of sinkhole of snow  the bent backs of technicians were then shown floundering away from the
remote camera to his aid  people with snow blowers stood in their own little blizzards  a pedestrian was filmed doing a
spectacular pratfall  cars at all angles in streets were shown with their tires spinning  shuddering in stasis  one track kept cutting
back to a man endlessly trying to brush off a windshield that immediately whitened again behind each brushstroke  a bus sat with
its snout in a monster sized drift  athscme fans atop the wall north of ti conderoga nny were shown making horizontal
cyclones of snow in the air  rouged somber women in interlace studios concurred that this was the worst blizzard to hit the
region since b s       and the second worst since b s        a man in a wheelchair was shown staring stonily at a two meter
drift across the ramp outside the state house  satellite maps of east central o n a n  showed a white formation that was spiralled
and shaggy and seemed to have what looked like claws  it was not a nor easter  a hot moist ridge from the gulf of mexico and an
arctic cold front had collided over the concavity  the storm s satellite photo was superimposed on schemata of the     ass kicker
and shown to be just about identical  an unwelcome old acquaintance was back  a striking woman with black bangs and vivid

 lipstick said  smiling somberly  another track iterated  this was not a nor easter  it might have been better to say  smiling
mirthlessly   the flat glazed eyes of the man brushing impotently at his windshield seemed to represent an important visual image 
different tracks kept returning to his face  he refused to acknowledge journalists or requests for thoughts  his was the creepy
businesslike face of someone carefully picking up glass in the road after an accident in which his decapitated wife s been impaled
on the steering wheel  another track s anchor was a beautiful black woman with purple lipstick and what looked like a very tall
crew cut  reports of snow came in from all directions  after a while i stopped keeping track of the number of times the word
snow was repeated  all synonyms for snowstorm were rapidly exhausted  helmetless thrill seekers on snowmobiles were doing
doughnuts in copley square downtown  homeless men hunched nearly drift covered in doorways  readying snorkels of rolled up
newspaper  jim troeltsch  now apparently a resident of b      had liked to do a pretty funny impression of an interlace
anchorwoman having an orgasm  one of the thrill seekers  snowmobiles spun out of control and plunged into a drift  and the
remote camera stayed on the drift for several moments  but nothing emerged  connecticut s national guard reserve had been
ordered to assemble but had not assembled because travel in connecticut was impossible  three men in uniforms and gray
helmets chased two men in white helmets  all on snowmobiles  for reasons an on site journalist described as not yet emergent 
remote site journalists used such words as emergent  individual  alleged  utilize  and developing  but all this impersonal diction
was preceded by the anchorperson s first name  as if the report were part of an intimate conversation  an interlace delivery boy
was shown delivering recorded cartridges on a snowmobile and was described as plucky  otis p  lord had undergone a procedure
for the removal of the hitachi monitor on thursday  lamont chu had said  i had never once ridden a snowmobile  skied  or
skated  e t a  discouraged them  delint described winter sports as practically getting down on one knee and begging for an
injury  the snowmobiles on the viewer all made sounds like little chain saws that were extra pugnacious to compensate for being
so little  there was a poignant shot of a stuck plow in northampton   individuals who are not with emergency reasons to travel 
 sic  were being officially discouraged from travelling by a state trooper in a hat with a chinstrap  a brockton man in a lands  end
parka took a fall too burlesque to have been unstaged 
i could barely recall the     blizzard  the academy had been open for only a few months  i remember the edges of the shaved
hilltop were still square and steep and striped in sedimentary layers  final construction delayed by some nasty piece of litigation
from the va hospital below  the storm came barrelling in southeast from canada in march  dwight flechette and orin and the
other players had had to be led to the lung roped together  single file  schtitt in the lead carrying a highway flare  a couple photos
hung in c t  s waiting room  the last boy along the rope disappeared into a forlorn gray whirl  the lung s new bubble had had to
be taken down and fixed when snow weight stove it in on one side  the t stopped running  i remember some of the younger
players had cried and sworn up and down that the blizzard wasn t their fault  for days snow churned steadily out of a graphite sky 
himself had sat in a spindle backed chair  at the same living room window c t  now uses for advanced worry  and aimed a series
of nondigital cameras at the mounting snow  after years in which his consuming obsession was the establishment of e t a   orin
said  himself had started in with the film obsession almost immediately after the academy was up and running  orin has said the
moms had assumed the film thing was a passing obsession  himself had seemed interested mostly in the lenses and rasters      
at first  and in the consequences of their modification  he sat in that chair throughout the whole storm  sipping brandy from a onehanded snifter  his long legs not quite covered by a plaid blanket  his legs had seemed to me almost endlessly long back then  he
always seemed to be right on the edge of coming down with something  his record up until then indicated that he remained
obsessed with something until he became successful at it  then transferred his obsession to something else  from military optics to
annular optics to entrepreneurial optics to tennis pedagogy to film  in the chair during the blizzard he d had beside him several
different types of camera and a large leather case  the inside of the case was striated with lenses down both sides  he used to let
mario and me put different lenses in our eyes and squint to hold them  imitating schtitt 
one way of looking at the film obsession s endurance is that himself was never really successful or accomplished at
filmmaking  this was something else on which mario and i had agreed to disagree 
it took almost a year to complete the move from weston to e t a  the moms had attachments in weston and she drew things
out  i was pretty small  i lay flat on my back on our room s carpet and tried to recall details of our home in weston  twidgeling the
tp s remote with my thumb  i do not have mario s head for remembered detail  one dissemination track simply panned the metroboston sky and horizons from atop the hancock tower  on the fm band  wyyy was apparently doing its weather report via
mimesis  broadcasting raw static while the student staff doubtless did bongs in celebration of the storm and then went up sliding
around the union s cerebral rooftop  the hancock camera s pan included the sinciput of the m i t  union  its roof s convolutions
filling with snow ahead of the rest of it  creepy filigrees of white against the roof s deep gray 
our subdorm room s only carpet was an oversized corruption of the carpet page from the lindisfarne gospels in which you
had to look very closely to make out the tiny pornographic scenes in the byzantine weave surrounding the cross  i d acquired the
carpet years ago during a period of intense interest in byzantine pornography inspired by what i d seen as a titillating reference in
the o e d  i too had moved serially between obsessions  as a child  i adjusted my angle on the carpet  i was trying to align myself
along some sort of grain in the world i could barely feel  since pemulis and i stopped  meaning the grain  not the world  i realized
i could not distinguish my own visual memories of the weston house from my memories of hearing mario s detailed reports of his
memories  i remember a late victorian three level on a low quiet street of elms  hyperfertilized lawns  tall homes with oval
windows and screen porches  one of the street s homes had a pineapple finial  only the street itself was low  the lots were humped
up high and the houses so tall the broad street seemed nevertheless constricted  a sort of affluence flanked defile  it seemed always
to be summer or spring  i could remember the moms s voice high overhead at a screen porch door  calling us in as dusk drifted
down and leaded fanlights began to light up at homes  doors in some sort of linear sync  either our driveway or another driveway
flanked with whitewashed stones the shapes of beads or drops  the moms s intricate garden in a backyard enclosed by a
fencework of trees  himself on the screen porch  stirring a gin and tonic with his finger  the moms s dog s  johnson  not yet
neutered  confined by psychosis in a sort of large fenced pen abutting the garage  running around and around the pen when
thunder sounded  the smell of noxzema  himself behind orin in the upstairs bathroom  towering over and down  teaching orin to
shave against the grain  upward  i remember s  johnson leaping up on his hind legs and sort of playing the fence with his paws as
mario approached the pen  the rattling chain link s pitch  the circle of earth worn bare by s j  s orbit in the pen when thunder

 sounded or planes crossed overhead  himself sat low in chairs and could cross his legs and still have both feet flat on the floor 
he d hold his chin in his hand while he looked at you  my memories of weston seemed like tableaux  they seemed more like
snapshots than films  a weird isolated memory of summertime gnats knitting the air above the shaggy animal head of a neighbor s
topiary hedge  our own round shrubs trimmed flat as tabletops by the moms  more horizontals  the chatter of hedge clippers 
their power cords bright orange  i had to swallow spit with almost every breath  i remembered climbing with a dawdler s heavy
tread the cement steps up from the street to a gambrel roofed late victorian whose narrow height from the steps gave it the
distended look of thick liquid hanging  gingerbread eaves  undulate shingles of weathered red  zinc gutters the moms s graduate
students came and kept clean  a blue star in the front window and the words block mother  which had always suggested
either a rectangular woman or some type of football crowd cheer  the inside cool and dim and a smell of lemon pledge  i had no
visual memories of my mother without white hair  all that varied was the length  a touch tone phone  with a cord running into the
wall  on a horizontal surface in a recessed alcove near the front door  cork floors and pre mounted shelving of woody smelling
wood  the chilling framed print of lang directing metropolis in             a hulking black chest with strap hinges of brass  a
few of himself s old heavy tennis trophies as bookends on the mounted shelving  an etagere filled with old fashioned magnetic
videos in bright adverting boxes  a cluster of blue and white delfts on the etagere s top shelf that had dwindled as one figurine
after another got knocked off by mario  stumbling or shoved  the blue white chairs with the protective plastic that made your legs
sweat  a divan done in some sort of burlapesque iranian wool dyed to the color of sand mixed with ash   this may have been a
neighbor s divan  some cigarette burns in the fabric of the divan s arms  books  videotapes  kitchen s cans   all alphabetized 
everything painfully clean  several spindle backed captain s chairs in contrasting fruit woods  a surreal memory of a steamed
lavatory mirror with a knife sticking out of the pane  a massive stereo television console of whose gray green eye i was afraid
when the television was off  some of the memories have to be confabulated or dreamed   the moms would never have had a
divan with burns in it 
a picture window east  the direction of boston  with claret colored figures and a blue sun all suspended in a web of lead  the
candy colored summer sunrise through that window as i watched television in the a m 
the tall thin quiet man  himself  with his razor burn and bent glasses and chinos too short  whose neck was slender and
shoulders sloped  who slumped in candied east window sunlight with his tailbone supported by windowsills  meekly stirring a
glass of something with his finger while the moms stood there telling him she d long since abandoned any reasonable hope that he
could hear what she was telling him   this silent figure  of whom i still remember mostly endless legs and the smell of noxzema
shave cream  seems  still  impossible to reconcile with the sensibility of something like accomplice  it was impossible to imagine
himself conceiving of sodomy and razors  no matter how theoretically  i lay there and could almost remember orin telling me
something almost moving that himself had once told him  something to do with accomplice  the memory hung somewhere just
out of conscious reach  and its tip of the tongue inaccessibility felt too much like the preface to another attack  i accepted it  i
could not remember 
off down the weston street a church with an announcement board in the grass out front   white plastic letters on a slotted
black surface   and at least once mario and i stood watching a goatish man change the letters and thus the announcement  one of
the first occasions where i remember reading something involved the announcement board announcing 
life is like tennis those who serve best usually win
with the letters all spaced far out like that  a big fresh cement colored church  liberal with glass  denomination not recalled 
but built in what was  in the b s   o s probably  modern   a parabolic poured concrete shape billowed and peaked like a cresting
wave  a suggestion in it of some paranormal wind somewhere that could make concrete billow and pop like a tucking sail 
our own subdorm room now has three of those old weston captain s chairs whose backs dent your spine if you don t fit it
carefully between two spindles  we have an unused wicker basket for laundry on which are stacked some corduroy spectationpillows  floor plans for hagia sophia and s  simeon at qal at si man on the wall over my bed  the really prurient part of
consummation of the levirates over the chairs  also from the old interest in byzantinalia  something about the stiff and
dismantled quality of maniera greca porn  people broken into pieces and trying to join  etc  at the foot of mario s bed a surplusstore trunk for his own film equipment and a canvas director s chair where he s always laid out his police lock  lead weights  and
vest for the night  a fiberboard stand for the compact tp and viewer  and a stenographer s chair for using the tp to type  five total
chairs in a room where no one ever sits in a chair  as in all the subdorm rooms and hallways  a guilloche ran around our walls half
a meter from the ceiling  new e t a s always drove themselves bats counting their room s guilloche s interwoven circles  our
room had     and truncated bits of     and      two left halves stuck like open parentheses up in the southwest corner  between
the ages of eleven and thirteen i d had a plaster knock off of a lewd constantine frieze  the emperor with a hyperemic organ and
an impure expression  hung by two hooks from the guilloche s lower border  now i couldn t for the life of me recall what i d done
with the frieze  or which byzantine seraglio the original had decorated  there had been a time when data like these were instantly
available 
the weston living room had had an early version of himself s full spectrum cove lighting and at one end an elevated
fieldstone fireplace with a big copper hood that made a wonderful ear splitting drum head for wooden spoons  with memories of
some foreign adult i didn t recognize grinding at her temples and pleading do stop  the moms s jungle of green babies had
spread out into the room from another corner  the plants  pots on stands of various heights  hanging in nests of twine suspended
from clamps  arrayed at eye height from projecting trellises of white painted iron  all in the otherworldly glow of a white hooded
tube of ultraviolet light hung with thin chains from the ceiling  mario can recall violet lit laces of ferns and the wet meaty gloss of
rubber tree leaves 
and a coffee table of green shot black marble  too heavy to move  on whose corner mario knocked out a tooth after what
orin swore up and down was an accidental shove 
mrs  clarke s varicotic calves at the stove  the way her mouth overhead would disappear when the moms reorganized
something in the kitchen  my eating mold and the moms s being very upset that i d eaten it   this memory was of orin s telling
the story  i had no childhood memory of eating fungus 
my trusty nasa glass still rested on my chest  rising when my rib cage rose  when i looked down my own length  the glass s

 round mouth was a narrow slot  this was because of my optical perspective  there was a concise term for optical perspective that
i again could not quite make resolve 
what made it hard really to recall our old house s living room was that so many of its appointments were now in the living
room of the headmaster s house  the same and yet altered  and by more than rearrangement  the onyx coffee table mario had
fallen against  specular is what refers to optical perspective  it came to me after i stopped trying to recall it  now supported
compact disks and tennis magazines and a cello shaped vase of dried eucalyptus  and the red steel stand for the family xmas tree 
when in season  the table had been a wedding gift from himself s mother  who died of emphysema shortly before mario s
surprise birth  orin reports she d looked like an embalmed poodle  all neck tendons and tight white curls and eyes that were all
pupil  the moms s birth mother had died in quebec of an infarction when she   the moms   was eight  her father during her
sophomore year at mcgill under circumstances none of us knew  the hydrant sized mrs  tavis was still alive and somewhere in
alberta  the original l islet potato farm now part of the great concavity and forever lost 
orin and bain et al  at family trivia during that terrible first year s blizzard  orin imitating the moms s high breathy  my son
ate this  god  please    never tiring of it 
orin had liked also to recreate for us the spooky kyphotic hunch of himself s mother  in her wheelchair  beckoning him closer
with a claw  the way she seemed always caved in over and around her chest as if she d been speared there  an air of deep
dehydration had hung about her  he said  as if she osmosized moisture from whoever came near  she spent her last few years
living in the marlboro st  brownstone they d had before mario and i were born  tended by a gerontologic nurse orin said always
wore the expression of every post office mug shot you ve ever seen  when the nurse was off  a small silver bell was apparently
hung from an arm of the old lady s wheelchair  to be rung when she could not breathe  a cheery silver tinkle announcing
asphyxiation upstairs  mrs  clarke would still pale whenever mario asked about her 
it s become easier to see the climacteric changes in the moms s own body since she began confining herself more and more to
the headmaster s house  this occurred after himself s funeral  but in stages   the gradual withdrawal and reluctance to leave the
grounds  and the signs of aging  it is hard to notice what you see every day  none of the physical changes has been dramatic  
her nerved up dancer s legs becoming hard  stringy  a shrinking of the hips and a girdly thickening at the waist  her face settles a
little lower on her skull than it did four years ago  with a slight bunching under the chin and an emerging potential for something
pruny happening around her mouth  in time  i thought i could see 
the word that best connoted why the glass s mouth looked slotty was probably foreshortened 
the q r s  infantilist would no doubt join the old grief therapist in asking how watching one s moms begin to age makes you
feel inside  questions like these become almost koans  you have to lie when the truth is nothing at all  since this appears as a
textbook lie under the therapeutic model  the brutal questions are the ones that force you to lie 
either our old kitchen or a neighbor s kitchen panelled with walnut and hung with copper pate molds and herbal sprigs  an
unidentified woman   not avril or mrs  clarke   standing in that kitchen in snug cherry slacks  loafers over bare feet  waggling
a mixing spoon  laughing at something  a long tailed comet of flour on her cheek 
it occurred to me then with some force that i didn t want to play this afternoon  even if some sort of indoor exhibition meet
came off  not even neutral  i realized  i would on the whole have preferred not to play  what schtitt might have to say to that  v 
what lyle would say  i was unable to stay with the thought long enough to imagine himself s response to my refusal to play  if
any 
but this was the man who made accomplice   whose sensibility informed the hetero hardcore mobius strips and the sadoperiodontal fun with teeth and several other projects that were just thoroughgoingly nasty and sick 
then it occurred to me that i could walk outside and contrive to take a spill  or squeeze out the window on the rear staircase
of hmh and fall several meters to the steep embankment below  being sure to land on the bad ankle and hurt it  so i d not have to
play  that i could carefully plan out a fall from the courts  observation transom or the spectators  gallery of whatever club c t  and
the moms sent us to to help raise funds  and fall so carefully badly i d take out all the ankle s ligaments and never play again 
never have to  never get to  i could be the faultless victim of a freak accident and be knocked from the game while still on the
ascendant  becoming the object of compassionate sorrow rather than disappointed sorrow 
i couldn t stay with this fantastic line of thought long enough to parse out whose disappointment i was willing to cripple
myself to avoid  or forgo  
and then out of nowhere it returned to me  the moving thing himself had said to orin  this was concerning  adult  films 
which from what i ve seen are too downright sad to be truly nasty  or even really entertainment  though the adjective adult is kind
of a misnomer 
orin had told me that once he and smothergill  flechette  and i think penn s older brother had gotten hold of a magnetic video
of some old hardcore x film   the green door or deep throat  one of those old chestnuts of cellulite and jism  there were
excited plans to convene in v r   and watch the thing in secret after lights out  the viewing rooms at that point had broadcast
televisions and magnetic vcr devices  instructional mag vids from galloway and braden  etc  orin and co  were all around
fifteen at the time  bombed by their own glands   they were pop eyed at the prospect of genuine porn  there were rules about
videos  suitability for viewing in the honor code  but himself was not noted for his discipline  and schtitt didn t yet have delint
  the first generation of e t a s did pretty much as they pleased off court  as long as they were discreet 
nevertheless  word about this  adult  film got around  and somebody   probably mary esther thode s sister ruth  then a
senior and insufferable   ratted the boys  viewing plans out to schtitt  who took the matter to himself  orin said he was the only
one himself called into the headmaster s office  which in that era had only one door  which himself asked orin to close  orin
recalled seeing none of the unease that always accompanied himself s attempts at stern discipline  instead himself invited orin to
sit and gave him a lemon soda and stood facing him  leaning back slightly so that the front edge of his desk supported him at the
tailbone  himself took his glasses off and massaged his closed eyes delicately   almost trea suringly  his old eyeballs   in the
way orin knew signified that himself was ruminative and sad  one or two soft interrogatives brought the whole affair out in the
open  you could never lie to himself  somehow you just never had the heart  whereas orin made almost an olympic sport of
lying to the moms  anyway  orin quickly confessed to everything 

 what himself said then moved him  orin told me  himself told orin he wasn t going to forbid them to watch the thing if they
really wanted to  but just please to keep it discreet  just bain and smothergill and orin s immediate circle  nobody younger  and
nobody whose parents might hear about it  and for god s sake don t let your mother get wind  but that orin was old enough to
make his own entertainment decisions  and if he decided he wanted to watch the thing       and so on 
but himself said that if orin wanted his personal  fatherly as opposed to headmasterly  take on it  then he  orin s father  
though he wouldn t forbid it   would rather orin didn t watch a hard porn film yet  he said this with such reticent earnestness
there was no way orin couldn t ask him how come  himself felt his jaw and pushed his glasses up several times and shrugged and
finally said he supposed he was afraid of the film giving orin the wrong idea about having sex  he said he d personally prefer that
orin wait until he d found someone he loved enough to want to have sex with and had had sex with this person  that he d wait until
he d experienced for himself what a profound and really quite moving thing sex could be  before he watched a film where sex was
presented as nothing more than organs going in and out of other organs  emotionless  terribly lonely  he said he supposed he was
afraid that something like the green door would give orin an impoverished  lonely idea of sexuality 
what poor old o  claimed to have found so moving was himself s assumption that o  was still cherry  what moved me to feel
sorry for orin was that it seemed pretty obvious that that had nothing to do with what himself was trying to talk about  it was the
most open i d ever heard of himself being with anybody  and it seemed terribly sad to me  somehow  that he d wasted it on orin 
i d never once had a conversation nearly that open or intimate with himself  my most intimate memory of himself was the
scratchiness of his jaw and the smell of his neck when i fell asleep at supper and he carried me upstairs to bed  his neck was thin
but had a good meaty warm smell  i now for some reason associate it with the odor of coach schtitt s pipe 
i tried briefly to picture ortho stice hoisting his bunk up and bolting it to the ceiling without waking coyle  our room s door
remained ajar from mario s exit with coyle to find someone with a master key  yardguard and wagenknecht s heads popped in
briefly and urged me to come have a look at the darkness s ruined map and withdrew when they got no response  the second
floor was pretty quiet  most of them were still dawdling at breakfast  awaiting some announcement on the weather and quebecois
squads  snow hit the windows with a gritty sound  the angle of the wind had made a kind of whistle out of one corner of the
subdorm building  and the whistling came and went 
then i heard john wayne s stride in the hall outside  light and even and easy on floors  the stride of a guy with stellar calfdevelopment  i heard his low sigh  then  though the door was too far behind me to see  for a moment or two i could somehow tell
for sure that john wayne s head was inside the open door  i could feel it clearly  almost painfully  he was looking down at me
lying there on the lindisfarne carpet  there was none of the gathering tension of a person deciding whether or not to speak  i
could feel my throat s equipment move when i swallowed  john wayne and i never had much to say to one another  there wasn t
even hostility between us  he ate dinner with us at hmh every so often because he and the moms were tight  the moms made
little attempt to disguise her attachment to wayne  now his breathing behind me was light and very even  no waste  complete
utilization of each breath       
of us three  it was mario who had spent the most time with himself  sometimes travelling with him for location work  i had
no idea what they spoke about together  or how openly  none of us had ever pressed mario to say much about it  it occurred to me
to wonder why this was so 
i decided to get up but then did not in fact get up  orin was convinced that himself was a virgin when he met the moms in his
late thirties  i find this pretty hard to believe  orin will also grant that there s no doubt himself was faithful to the moms right up
to the end  that his attachment to orin s fiancee was not sexual  i had a sudden and lucid vision of the moms and john wayne
locked in a sexual embrace of some kind  john wayne had been involved with the moms sexually since roughly the second month
after his arrival  they were both expatriates  i hadn t yet been able to identify a strong feeling one way or the other about the
liaison  nor about wayne himself  except for admiring his talent and total focus  i did not know whether mario knew of the
liaison  to say nothing of poor c t 
it was impossible for me to imagine himself and the moms being explicitly sexual together  i bet most children have this
difficulty where their parents are concerned  sex between the moms and c t  i imagined as both frenetic and weary  with a kind
of doomed timeless faulknerian feel to it  i imagined the moms s eyes open and staring blankly at the ceiling the whole time  i
imagined c t  never once shutting up  talking around and around whatever was taking place between them  my coccyx had gone
numb from the pressure of the floor through the thin carpet  bain  graduate students  grammatical colleagues  japanese fightchoreographers  the hairy shouldered ken n  johnson  the islamic m d  himself had found so especially torturing   these
encounters were imaginable but somehow generic  mostly a matter of athleticism and flexibility  different configurations of limbs 
the mood one more of cooperation than complicity or passion  i tended to imagine the moms staring expressionlessly at ceilings
throughout  the complicit passion would have come after  probably  with her need to be sure the encounter was hidden  petersonallusions notwithstanding  i wondered about some hazy connection between this passion for hiddenness and the fact that himself
had made so many films titled cage  and that the amateur player he became so attached to was the veiled girl  orin s love  i
wondered whether it was possible to lie supine and throw up without aspirating vomit or choking  the plumed spout of a whale 
the tableau of john wayne and my mother in my imagination was not very erotic  the image was complete and sharply focused
but seemed stilted  as if composed  she reclines against four pillows  at an angle between seated and supine  staring upward 
motionless and pale  wayne  slim and brown limbed  smoothly muscled  also completely motionless  lies over her  his untanned
bottom in the air  his blank narrow face between her breasts  his eyes unblinking and his thin tongue outthrust like a stunned
lizard s  they stay just like that 
she wasn t dumb   she figured it was likely that they d let her loose just to see where she d go 
she went home  she went to the house  she got one of the last trains before they closed the t  probably  it took forever to get
from comm  ave  down to enfield marine in her clogs and skirt in the snow  and melt soaked the veil and made it adhere to the
features below  she d been close to removing the veil to get away from the outside linebacker of a federal lady anyway  she
looked now just like a linen pale version of what she really looked like  but there was no one about in the snow  she figured if she
could speak with pat m  pat m  might be prevailed upon to put her in quarantine with clenette and yolanda  not let in no law  she
could tell pat about the wheelchairs  try to convince her to dismantle the ramp  the visibility was so bad she didn t see it til she

 cleared the shed  the middlesex county sheriff s car  fiercely snow tired  lights going bluely  parked idling in the roadlet outside
the ramp  wipers on occasional  a uniform at the wheel absently feeling his face 
he says  i m mikey  alcoholic and addict and a sick fuck  you know what i m saying  
and they laugh and shout out  you definitely are  as he stands there rocking the podium slightly  blurred a bit through the
linen  smearing one side of his face with a laborer s hand as he tries to think what to say  it s another of these round robin speaker
deals  each speaker picking the next from the smoky lunchtime crowd  jogging up to the fiberboard podium trying to think what to
say  and how  for the five minutes each is allotted  the chairperson at the table up by the podium has a clock and a novelty shop
gong 
 well   he says   well so i seen some of the old mikey come back out yesterday  you know what i m saying  fucking scared
me to see it  what it was  i was going to take my kid down to the lanes and bowl a couple  with my kid  who he just got the cast

whatnot  because you know how the judge said i got to get one of them s fucking consent to even see my kid  you know what i m
saying  because of the restraining order on the old mikey  from before  i got to get their permission  and i  what  accept that  i
say ok  so i m calling up all accepting and on the happy wagon for my sister to consent  and she out of the goodness of her heart
she makes me wait while she says she s got to check it with ma  and they consent  finally  and i  what  accept that  you know
what i m saying  and i say i was going to be there at such and such time and whatnot  and my sister says ain t i even going to say
thank you  like with the attitude  you know what i m saying  and i say  t the fuck  what  you want a fucking medal for letting me
see my own kid  and the cunt hangs up on me  oh  fucking oh  ever since the judge with the order  it s with the attitude over
there  the cunt and ma both  so after she just hangs up on me a little of the old mikey i think starts to come out and i go over there
and yes all right i got to be honest i do i park on the grass of their fucking lawn  and i go up and go up and i see her and i m like
fuck you you cunt  and ma s in the hall behind her in the door  i go fucking hang up on me why don t you  you should go for
some fucking counselling you know what i m saying  and they don t neither one of them like that verbal comment too much 
right  the cunt almost starts laughing and goes  like  i m telling her to go for counseling  
crowd laughter 
 i mean i ain t exactly coming over there with long term sobriety  right  and i accept that  but the cunt s got the hook on the
door and she s going who the fuck are you to be telling me to go for fucking counselling after the sick fucking little like stunt you
and that bimbo pulled on that kid who only just now even got the cast off  oh  and no sign of the fucking kid anywhere  just her
and ma through the screen door  all over the place with the attitude  and now they tell me to get the fuck off their porch  no they
tell me  as in like permission denied  consent to see my own kid fucking refused  and the cunt still in her fucking bathrobe after
noon  and ma behind her half in the bag already and hanging on to the fucking wall  you know what i m saying  my serenity s
like  see yaa  and i say up boat ayouse s asses  i m here for my goddamn kid  and now my sister says she s going for the phone 
and ma s saying the fuck  get the fuck out  mikey  and plus did i mention no sign of the kid  and i ain t to even like touch the
screen door  not without consent  and i m wanting to fucking kill somebody here  you know what i m saying  and my sister s
getting the antenna out on the phone  and so i go ok i m fucking leaving  but i like grab my balls at the both of them and go eat
me the boatayouse  you know what i m saying  cause now it s the old mikey back  and now   got with the attitude now  also  i m
wanting to light my cunt of a sister up so bad i can t hardly see to get the truck off the lawn and leave  but and so and but so i m
driving back home  and i m so mad i all of a sudden try and pray  and i try and pray  driving along and whatnot  and it comes to
me i see irregarding of their fucked up attitude i still need to go back and apologize irregardless  for grabbing my balls at them 
cause that s old fucking behavior  i see for my own sobriety s sake i need to go back and try and say i m sorry  the thought of it
just about makes me puke  you know what i m   but i go back and pull the truck up out front on the street and pray and go back
up on the porch  and i fucking apologize  and i go to my sister please can i at least see the kid to see the cast off  and the cunt goes
fuck you  get the fuck out  we don t accept your fucking apology  and no sign of ma  and the fucking kid there s no sign of him 
so i got to accept her word and don t even know for sure if the cast is even off  but why i needed to share i think is it scared me  i
scared me  you know what i m saying  i was at the counsellor s after and i told him i go i got to get some kind of hold on this
fucking temper or i m going to end up right back in front of the fucking judge for lighting somebody up again  you know what i m
saying  and god fucking forbid it should be somebody that s in my family  because i been that route once too many times
already  and i go like am i nuts  dr   or what  do i got a like death wish or what  you know what i m saying  the cast just only
now finally comes off and i m wanting to light up the fucking cunt that s got to consent i should get closer than a hundred m  s to
the kid  is it like i m trying to set myself up for a drink or what exactly is it with this spring loaded temper  if i m sober  the
temper and judge is why i fucking got sober in the first place  so what the fuck is this  well fuck me  i m just grateful i got some
of that out  it s been up in my head  renting space  you know what i m saying  i see vinnie s getting ready to fucking gong me  i
want to hear from tommy e  back there against the wall  yo tommy  what are you  spanking the hog back there or what  but
i m just glad to be here  i just wanted to get some of that shit out  
the man s pants  crease was gone at the knee and his cardin topcoat looked slept in 
 it was good of you to grant me an easement  
pat m  tried to recross her legs and shrugged   you said you weren t here professionally  
 good of you to believe me   the assistant district attorney for suffolk county s  th circuit up on the near north shore s hat
was a good dress stetson with a feather in the band  he held it up in his lap by the brim and slowly rotated it by moving his
fingers along the brim  he d re crossed his legs twice   we met you and mars at the marblehead regatta for the mcdonald s
house thing for children  not this summer but either the sum  
 i know who you are   pat s husband wasn t a celebrity but knew a lot of local celebrities  from the mint reconditioned sportscar upscale network around boston 
 well it s good of you  i m here about one of your residents  
 but not professionally   pat said  it wasn t a question or verification  she was cool steel when it came to protecting the

 residents and house  then back home in her own home she was a shattered husk of a wreck 
 frankly i m not sure why i am here  you re just down the hill from the hospital  i ve been up at saint elizabeth s off and on
for three days  perhaps   need to simply air this  the  th district boys   the p d s   speak well of the place  your house here 
perhaps i need simply to share this  to work up the nerve  my sponsor s no help  he s simply said do it if you want to have any
hope of things getting better  
anything less than a combination thoroughgoing professional and aa longtimer would have at least hiked an eyebrow at one
of the most powerful and remorseless constables in three counties saying sponsor 
 it s phob comp anon   the a d a  said   i went through choices       last winter and have been working a program of
recovery in phob comp anon a day at a time to the best of my ability ever since then  
 i see  
 it s tooty   the a d a  said  he did a pause with his eyes closed and then smiled  still with his eyes closed   it is  rather  me 
and my enmeshment issues with tooty s       condition  
phob comp anon was a decade old    step splinter from al anon  for codependency issues surrounding loved ones who
were cripplingly phobic or compulsive  or both 
 it s a long story and not a particularly interesting one  i m sure   the a d a  said   suffice to say that tooty s been in torment
over some oral dental hygienic violation issues that have their roots we re discovering in some issues from a childhood whose
dysfunctionality we   well  which she d been in denial about for quite some time  it doesn t matter what  my program s my own 
the hiding the car keys  the cutting off her credit with different dentists  the checking the wastebaskets for new brush wrappers
five times an hour   my unmanageability s my own  and i m doing what i can  day by day  to let go and detach with love  
 i think i understand  
 i m working nine  now  
pat said  the ninth step  
the a d a  reversed the hat s rotation by moving his fingers in the opposite direction along the brim 
 i m trying to make direct amends to whosoever my fourth  and eighth step work s revealed i ve harmed  except in cases
where to do so would injure them or others  
a tiny spiritual slip from pat in the form of a patronizing smile   i have a nodding acquaintance with nine myself  
the a d a  was barely there  his eyes fixed and dilated  the remorselessly ingathered eyebrow angle pat had always seen in
his photos was completely reversed  the brows now formed a little peaked roof of pathos 
 one of your residents   he said   a mr  gately  court remanded out of the  th circuit  peabody i believe  or staff counselor 
alumni  some status  
pat made a kind of exaggerated innocent trying to place the name type face 
the a d a  said  it doesn t matter  i m aware of your constraints  i want nothing from you on him  it s him i ve been up at
saint elizabeth s to see  
pat allowed herself one slightly flared nostril at this news 
the a d a  leaned forward  hat rotating between his calves  elbows on knees in the odd defecatory posture men used to try to
communicate earnestness in their sharing   i m told   i owe the   mr  gately   an amend  i need to make an amend to mr 
gately   he looked up   you too   this remains within these walls  as if it were my anonymity  all right  
 yes  
 it doesn t matter what for  i blamed the   i ve harbored a resentment  against this gately  concerning an incident i d
considered responsible for making tooty s phobia reflare  it doesn t matter  the specifics  or his culpability or exposure to
prosecution in the incident   i ve come to believe these don t matter  i ve harbored this resentment  the kid s picture s been up on
my priority board with the pictures of far more objectively important threats to the public weal  i ve been biding my time  waiting
to get him  this latest incident   no  don t say it  you needn t say a thing   seemed like just the opening  my last chance went
federal and then fizzled  
pat allowed herself a very slightly puzzled forehead 
the man waved the hat   it doesn t matter  i ve hated  hated this man  you know that enfield s suffolk county  this incident
with the canadian assault  the alleged firearm  the witnesses who can t depose because of their own exposure        my sponsor  my
entire group   they say if i act on the resentment i m doomed  i ll get no relief  it won t help tooty  tooty s lips will still be white
pulp from the peroxide  her enamel in tatters from the constant irrational brushing and brushing and brushing and    he clamped
his fine clean hand over his mouth and produced a high pitched noise that frankly gave pat the howlers  his right eyelid twitching 
he took several breaths   i need to let it go  i ve come to believe that  not just the prosecution   that s the easy part  i ve
already tossed the file  though whatever civil liability the   mr  gately might face is another matter  not my concern  it s so
damnably ironic  the man s going to two step out of at the very least a probation violation and prosecution on all his old highly
convictable charges because i have to pitch the case  for the sake of my own recovery  i  who wanted nothing so much as to see
this man locked down in a cell with some psychopathic cellmate for the rest of his natural life  who shook my fist at the ceiling
and vowed    and again the noise  this time muffled by the fine hat and so less well muffled  his shoes pounding a little on the
carpet in rage so that pat s dogs raised their heads and looked quizzically at him  and the epileptic one had a very small loud noise
seizure 
 i hear you saying this is very hard but you ve decided what you need to do  
 worse   the a d a  said  blotting his brow with an unfolded handkerchief   i have to make an amend  my sponsor s said  if i
want the growth that promises real relief  i have to make direct amends  put out my hand and say that i m sorry and ask the man s
forgiveness for my own failure to forgive  this is the only way i ll be able to forgive him  and i can t detach with love from
tooty s phobic compulsion until i ve forgiven the b  the man i ve blamed in my heart  
pat looked him in the eye 
 of course i can t say i ve tossed the canadian case s file  i needn t go that far they say  that would expose me to conflict of
interest   the irony   and could hurt tooty  if my position s threatened  i ve been told i can simply let him simmer on that until

 time passes and nothing moves forward   he raised his own eyes   which means you cannot tell anyone either  declining to
prosecute for personal spiritual reasons   the office   it would be hard for others to understand  this is why i ve come to you in
explicit confidence  
 i hear your request and i ll honor it  
 but listen  i can t do it  cannot  i ve sat outside that hospital room saying the serenity prayer over and over and praying for
willingness and thinking of my own spiritual interests and believing this amend is my higher power s will for my own growth and
i haven t been able to go in  i go and sit paralyzed outside the room for several hours and drive home and pry tooty away from the
sink  it can t go on  i have to look that rotten   no  evil  i m convinced in my heart  that son of a bitch is evil and deserves to be
removed from the community  i have to walk in there and extend my hand and tell him i ve wished him ill and blamed him and
ask for forgiveness   him   if you knew what sick  twisted  sadistically evil and sick thing he did to us  to her   and ask him
for forgiveness  whether he forgives or not is not the issue  it s my own side of the street i need to clean  
 it sounds very  very hard   pat said 
the fine hat was almost spinning between the man s calves  the pantcuffs of which had been pulled up in the defecatory
forward lean to reveal socks that weren t  it seemed  both quite the same texture of wool  the mismatched socks spoke to pat s
heart more than anything else 
 i don t even know why i came here   he said   i couldn t simply leave again and drive home  yesterday she d been at her
tongue with one of those old nocoat linguascraper appliances until it bled  i can t go home and look on that again without having
cleaned house  
 i hear you  
 and you were just down the hill  
 i understand  
 i don t expect help or counsel  i already believe i have to do it  i ve accepted the injunction to do it  i believe i have no choice 
but i can t do it  i haven t been able to do it  
 willing  maybe  
 haven t yet been willing  yet  i wish to emphasize yet  

   november year of the depend adult undergarment
immediately pre fundraiser exhibition fete
gaudeamus igitur
usually  part of the experience of having the place you live in throw a gala is watching different people arrive for the
festivities   the warshavers  the cartons and peltasons and prines  the chins  the middlebrooks and gelbs  an incidental lowell 
the buckmans in their claret colored volvo driven by their silent grown son who you never see except when he s driving kirk and
binnie buckman someplace  dr  hickle and his creepy niece  the chawafs and heavens  the reehagens  the palsied and mega
wealthy mrs  warshaver with her pair of designer canes  the donagan brothers from svelte nail  but usually we never get to see
them arriving  the friends and patrons of e t a   for the fundraising exhibition and gala  usually while they re arriving and getting
greeted by tavis we re all down in the lockers  dressing and stretching  getting ready to exhibit  getting shaved and taped by
loach  etc 
it must usually be an unusual occasion for the guests  too  because for the first few hours they re there to watch us play  
they re all audience   then at some point with the last couple matches winding down the guys in white jackets with trays start
appearing in comm  ad   and the gala starts  and then it s the guests who become the participants and performers 
dressing and stretching  wrapping grips with gauze tex or filling a pouch with fuller s earth  coyle  freer  slice  traub  or
sawdust  wagen knecht  chu   getting taped  those in puberty getting shaved and taped  a ritual  even the conversation  usually 
such as it is  has a timeless ceremonial aspect  john wayne hunched as always on the bench before his locker with his towel like a
hood over his head  running a coin back and forth over the backs of his fingers  shaw pinching the flesh between his thumb and
first finger  acupressure for a headache  everyone had gone into their like autopilot ritual  possalthwaite s sneakers were pigeontoed under a stall door  kahn was trying to spin a tennis ball on his finger like a basketball  at the sink  eliot kornspan was
blowing out his sinuses with hot water  no one else was anywhere near the sink  a certain number of hysterical pre competition
rumors about the quebec jr  team and the severity of the weather circulated and were refuted and shifted antigens and returned 
you could hear the high register end of the wind even down here  the csikszentmihalyi kid was doing a kind of piaffer in place 
his knees hitting his chest  stretching his hip flexors out  troeltsch sat up against his locker near wayne  wearing a disconnected
headset and broadcasting his own match in advance  there were fart accusations and  denials  rader snapped a towel at
wagenknecht  who liked to stand for long periods of time bent at the waist with his head against his knees  arslanian sat very still
in a corner  blindfolded in what was either an ascot or a very fey necktie  his head cocked in the attitude of the blind  it was
unclear whether b squads would even get to play  no one was sure how many courts the m i t  union had inside  rumors flew
this way and that  michael pemulis was nowhere to be seen since early this a m   at which time anton doucette said he d seen
pemulis quote  lurking  out by the west house dumpsters looking quote  anxiously depressed  
then a small but univocal cheer went up from some of the players when otis p  lord appeared at the door  his cadaverous
dad escorting him  o p l  out of post op and pale but looking his old self  with just a thin little choker width bandage of gauze
around his neck from the monitor s removal and an odd ellipse of dry red skin around his mouth and nostrils  he came in and
shook a few hands and used the stall next to postal weight and left  he wasn t playing today 
j  l  struck was applying an astringent to areas of his jaw 
an hysterical rumor that the quebec players had been spotted coming down a ramp out of a charter bus in the main lot and
were by all appearances not the quebec j d c  and  w c  squads but some sort of special olympicish quebec adult wheelchairtennis contingent   this rumor flew wildly around the locker room and then died out when a couple of the sub    s who burned
nervous energy by scampering around checking rumors scampered out and up the stairs to check the rumor and failed to return 

 across the wall on the female side we could easily hear thode and donni stott invoking camilla  goddess of speed and light
step  thode had had an hysterical tantrum after breakfast because poutrincourt hadn t showed for the females  pre match staff
thing and looked to be awol  loach et al  had outfitted ted schacht with a complex knee brace with jointed aluminum struts
down both sides and a coin sized hole in the elastic over the kneecap for dermal ventilation  and schacht was lumbering around
between the stalls and the locker with his arms straight out and his weight on his heels pretending to walk like frankenstein 
several people talked to themselves at their lockers  barry loach was down on one knee shaving hal s left ankle for tape  a
couple of us remarked how hal wasn t eating the usual customary snickers bar or aminopal  hal had his hands on loach s shoulders as the tape went on  a match wrap is two horizontal layers just above the malleolus knob thing  then straight down and four
times around the tarsus just in front of the joint  so there s a big gap for flexion of the joint  but a compacting and supportive wrap 
then loach puts a liner sock and a wick sock over the tape  then slides on the little inflatable aircast deal and pumps it to the
right pressure  checking with a little gauge  and velcros it just tight enough for support plus max flexion  hal was on the bench
with his hands on loach s shoulders through the whole little routine  everybody s had his hands on loach s shoulders at one time
or another  hal s shave and wrap take four minutes  schacht s knee and fran unwin s hamstring thing each take over ten  wayne s
quarter looked like it was dancing on his knuckles  because of the towel over his head all you could see was a very thin oval
section of his face  like an almond on its end  wayne got to have a small disk player in his locker  and joni mitchell was playing 
which nobody ever minded because he kept it very low  stice was blowing a purple bubble  freer was trying to touch his toes 
traub and whale  also on the wrap bench  later said hal was being weird  like they said asking loach if the pre match locker
room ever gave him a weird feeling  occluded  electric  as if all this had been done and said so many times before it made you feel
it was recorded  they all in here existed basically as fourier transforms of postures and little routines  locked down and stored and
call uppable for rebroadcast at specified times  what traub heard as fourier transforms whale heard as furrier transforms  but
also  as a consequence  erasable  hal had said  by whom  hal before a match usually had a wide eyed ingen uish anxiety of
someone who d never been in a situation even remotely like this before  his face today had assumed various expressions ranging
from distended hilarity to scrunched grimace  expressions that seemed unconnected to anything that was going on  the word was
that tavis and schtitt had chartered three buses to take the squads to an indoor venue mrs  inc had had alumnus corbett th thorp
call in mammoth favors to arrange   several mostly unused courts somewhere in the deep brain tissue of the m i t  student
union   and that the whole gala would be moved over to the student union  and that the quebec team and most of the guests
were being contacted by cellular about the cancellation of the previous cancellation and the change in venue  and that those guests
who didn t hear about the change would ride in the buses with the players and staff  some of them in formal  and evening wear 
probably  the guests  traub also says he also heard hal use the word moribund  but whale couldn t confirm  schacht entered a
stall and drove the latch home with a certain purposeful sound that produced that momentary gunslinger enters saloon type hush
throughout the locker room  nobody in the vicinity could say they heard barry loach respond one way or another to any of the
strange moody things hal was saying as loach locked down the ankle for high level play  wa genknecht apparently really did
fart 
the consensus among e t a s is that head trainer barry loach resembles a wingless fly blunt and scuttly  etc  one e t a 
tradition consists of big buddies recounting to new or very young little buddies the saga of loach and how he ended up as an
elite head trainer even though he doesn t have an official degree in training or whatever from boston college  which is where
he d gone to school  in outline form  the saga goes that loach grew up as the youngest child of an enormous catholic family  the
parents of which were staunch catholics of the old school of extremely staunch catholicism  and that mrs  loach  as in the
mom  s life s most fervent wish was that one of her countless children would enter the r c  clergy  but that the eldest loach boy
had done a two year u s n  bit and had gotten de mapped early on in the brazilian o n a n  u n  joint action of y t m p   and
that within weeks of the wake the next oldest loach boy had died of ciquatoxic food poisoning eating tainted blackfin grouper 
and the next oldest loach  therese  through a series of adolescent misadventures had ended up in atlantic city nj as one of the
women in sequined leotards and high heels who carries a large posterboard card with the round   on it around the ring between
rounds of professional fights  so that hopes for therese becoming a carmelite dimmed considerably  and on down the line  one
loach falling helplessly in love and marrying right out of high school  another burning only to play the cymbals with a first rate
philharmonic  now crashing away with the houston p o    and so on  until there was just one other loach child and then barry
loach  who was the youngest and also totally under mrs  l  s thumb  emotionally  and that young barry had breathed a huge sigh
of relief when his older brother   always a pious and contemplative and big hearted kid  brimming over with abstract love and an
innate faith in the indwelling goodness of all men s souls   began to show evidence of a true spiritual calling to a life of service
in the r c  clergy  and ultimately entered jesuit seminary  removing an enormous weight from his younger brother s psyche
because young barry   ever since he first slapped a band aid on an x men figure   felt his true calling was not to the
priesthood but to the liniment and adhesive ministry of professional athletic training  who  finally  can say the whys and whences
of each man s true vocation  and then so barry was a training major or whatever at b c   and by all accounts proceeding
satisfactorily toward a degree  when his older brother  quite far along toward getting ordained or frocked or whatever as a licensed
jesuit  suffered at age twenty five a sudden and dire spiritual decline in which his basic faith in the innate indwelling goodness of
men like spontaneously combusted and disappeared   and for no apparent or dramatic reason  it just seemed as if the brother had
suddenly contracted a black misanthropic spiritual outlook the way some twenty five year old men contract sanger brown s
ataxia or m s   a kind of degenerative lou gehrig s disease of the spirit   and his interest in serving man and god in man and
nurturing the indwelling christ in people through jesuitical pursuits underwent an understandable nosedive  and he began to do
nothing but sit in his dormitory room at st  john s seminary   right near enfield tennis academy  coincidentally  on foster
street in brighton off comm  ave   right by the archdiocese h q  or whatever   sitting there trying to pitch playing cards into a
wastebasket in the middle of the floor  not going to classes or vespers or reading his hours  and talking frankly about giving up
the vocation altogether  which all had mrs  loach just about prostrate with disappointment  and had young barry suddenly reweighted with dread and anxiety  because if his brother bailed out of the clergy it would be nearly irresistibly incumbent on barry 
the very last loach  to give up his true vocation of splints and flexion and enter seminary himself  to keep his staunch and beloved
mom from dying of disappointment  and so a series of personal interviews with the spiritually necrotic brother took place  barry

 having to station himself on the other side of the playing cards  wastebasket so as even to get the older brother s attention  trying to
talk the brother down from the misanthropic spiritual ledge he was on  the spiritually ill brother was fairly cynical about barry
loach s reasons for trying to talk him down  seeing as how both men knew that barry s own career dreams were on the line here
as well  though the brother smiled sardonically and said he d come to expect little better than self interested  l looking out from
human beings anyway  since his prac ticum work out among the human flocks in some of boston s nastier downtown venues  
the impossibility of conditions changing  the ingratitude of the low life homeless addicted and mentally ill flocks he served  and
the utter lack of compassion and basic help from the citizenry at large in all jesuitical endeavors   had killed whatever spark of
inspired faith he d had in the higher possibilities and perfectibility of man  so he opined what should he expect but that his own
little brother  no less than the coldest commuter passing the outstretched hands of the homeless and needy at park street station 
should be all too humanly concerned with nothing but the care and feeding of numero uno  since a basic absence of empathy and
compassion and taking the risk to reach out seemed to him now an ineluctable part of the human character  barry loach was
understandably way out his depth on the theological turf of like apologia and the redeemability of man   though he was able to
relieve a slight hitch in the brother s toss that was stressing his card throwing arm s flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and so to up the
brother s card in wastebasket percentage significantly   but he was not only desperate to preserve his mother s dream and his
own indirectly athletic ambitions at the same time  he was actually rather a spiritually upbeat guy who just didn t buy the brother s
sudden despair at the apparent absence of compassion and warmth in god s supposed self mimetic and divine creation  and he
managed to engage the brother in some rather heated and high level debates on spirituality and the soul s potential  not that much
unlike alyosha and ivan s conversations in the good old brothers k   though probably not nearly as erudite and literary  and
nothing from the older brother even approaching the carcinogenic acerbity of ivan s grand inquisitor scenario 
in outline  it eventually boiled down to this  a desperate barry loach   with mrs  l  now on    mg  of daily ativan      
and just about camped out in front of the candle lighting apse of the loach s parish church   loach challenges his brother to let
him prove somehow   risking his own time  barry s  and maybe safety somehow   that the basic human character wasn t as
unempathetic and necrotic as the brother s present depressed condition was leading him to think  after a few suggestions and
rejections of bets too way out even for barry loach s desperation  the brothers finally settle on a  like  experimental challenge 
the spiritually despondent brother basically challenges barry loach to not shower or change clothes for a while and make himself
look homeless and disreputable and louse ridden and clearly in need of basic human charity  and to stand out in front of the park
street t station on the edge of the boston common  right alongside the rest of the downtown community s lumpen dregs  who all
usually stood there outside the t station stemming change  and for barry loach to hold out his unclean hand and instead of
stemming change simply ask passersby to touch him  just to touch him  viz  extend some basic human warmth and contact  and
this barry does  and does  days go by  his own spiritually upbeat constitution starts taking blows to the solar plexus  it s not clear
whether the verminousness of his appearance had that much to do with it  it just turned out that standing there outside the station
doors and holding out his hand and asking people to touch him ensured that just about the last thing any passerby in his right mind
would want to do was touch him  it s possible that the respectable citizenry with their bookbags and cellulars and dogs with little
red sweater vests thought that sticking one s hand way out and crying  touch me  just touch me  please  was some kind of new
stem type argot for  lay some change on me   because barry loach found himself hauling in a rather impressive daily total of    
significantly more than he was earning at his work study job wrapping ankles and sterilizing dental prostheses for boston college
lacrosse players  citizens found his pitch apparently just touching enough to give him    but b  loach s brother   who often
stood there in collar less mufti up against the plastic jamb of the t sta tion s exit  slouched and smirking and idly shuffling a deck
of cards in his hands   was always quick to point out the spastic delicacy with which the patrons dropped change or   into barry
loach s hand  these kind of bullwhip motions or jagged in and outs like they were trying to get something hot off a burner  never
touching him  and they rarely broke stride or even made eye contact as they tossed alms b l  s way  much less ever getting their
hand anywhere close to contact with b l  s disreputable hand  the brother not unreasonably nixed the accidental contact of one
commuter who d stumbled as he tried to toss a quarter and then let barry break his fall  not to mention the bipolarly ill bag lady
who got barry loach in a headlock and tried to bite his ear off near the end of the third week of the challenge  barry l  refused to
concede defeat and misanthropy  and the challenge dragged on week after week  and the older brother got bored eventually and
stopped coming and went back to his room and waited for the st  john s seminary administration to give him his walking papers 
and barry loach had to take incompletes in the semester s training courses  and got canned from his work study job for not
showing up  and he went through weeks and then months of personal spiritual crisis as passerby after passerby interpreted his
appeal for contact as a request for cash and substituted abstract loose change for genuine fleshly contact  and some of the tstation s other disreputable stem artists became intrigued by barry s pitch   to say nothing of his net receipts   and started
themselves to take up the cry of  touch me  please  please  someone    which of course further compromised barry loach s
chances of getting some citizen to interpret his request literally and lay hands on him in a compassionate and human way  and
loach s own soul began to sprout little fungal patches of necrotic rot  and his upbeat view of the so called normal and respectable
human race began to undergo dark revision  and when the other scuzzy and shunned stem artists of the downtown district treated
him as a compadre and spoke to him in a colle gial way and offered him warming drinks from brown bagged bottles he felt too
disillusioned and coldly alone to be able to refuse  and thus started to fall in with the absolute silt at the very bottom of the metro
boston socio economic duck pond  and then what happened with the spiritually infirm older brother and whither he fared and
what happened with his vocation never gets resolved in the e t a  loach story  because now the focus becomes all loach and
how he was close to forgetting   after all these months of revulsion from citizens and his getting any kind of nurturing or
empathic treatment only from homeless and addicted stem artists   what a shower or washing machine or a ligamental
manipulation even were  much less career ambitions or a basically upbeat view of indwelling human goodness  and in fact barry
loach was dangerously close to disappearing forever into the fringes and dregs of metro boston street life and spending his whole
adult life homeless and louse ridden and stemming in the boston common and drinking out of brown paper bags  when along
toward the end of the ninth month of the challenge  his appeal   and actually also the appeals of the other dozen or so cynical
stem artists right alongside loach  all begging for one touch of a human hand and holding their hands out   when all these
appeals were taken literally and responded to with a warm handshake   which only the more severely intoxicated stemmers

 didn t recoil from the profferer of  plus loach   by e t a  s own mario incan denza  who d been sent dashing out from the back
bay co op where his father was filming something that involved actors dressed up as god and the devil playing poker with tarot
cards for the soul of cosgrove watt  using subway tokens as the ante  and mario d been sent dashing out to get another roll of
tokens from the nearest station  which because of a dumpster fire near the entrance to the arlington st  station turned out to be
park street  and mario  being alone and only fourteen and largely clueless about anti stem defensive strategies outside t stations 
had had no one worldly or adult along with him there to explain to him why the request of men with outstretched hands for a
simple handshake or high five shouldn t automatically be honored and granted  and mario had extended his clawlike hand and
touched and heartily shaken loach s own fuliginous hand  which led through a convoluted but kind of heartwarming and faithreaffirming series of circumstances to b  loach  even w o an official b a   being given an asst  trainer s job at e t a   a job he
was promoted from just months later when the then head trainer suffered the terrible accident that resulted in all locks being
taken off e t a  saunas  doors and the saunas  maximum temperature being hard wired down to no more than    c 
the inverted glass was the size of a cage or small jail cell  but it was still recognizably a bathroom type tumbler  as if for
gargling or post brushing swishing  only huge and upside down  on the floor  with him inside  the tumbler was like a prop or
display  it was the sort of thing that would have to be made special  its glass was green and its bottom over his head was pebbled
and the light inside was the watery dancing green of extreme ocean depths 
there was a kind of louvered screen or vent high on one side of the glass  but no air was coming out  in  the air inside the
huge glass was pretty clearly limited  as well  because there was already co  steam on the sides  the glass was too thick to break
or to kick his way out  and it felt like he might have possibly broken the leg s foot already trying 
there were some green and distorted faces through the glass s side s steam  the face at eye level belonged to the latest
subject  the dexterous and adoring swiss hand model  she stood looking at him  her arms crossed  smoking  exhaling greenly
through her nose  then looked down to confer with another face  seeming to float at about waist level  that belonged to the shy and
handicapped fan who o  d realized had shared the subject s swiss accent 
the subject behind the glass would meet orin s eye steadily but did not acknowledge him or anything he shouted  when orin
had tried to kick his way out was when he d recognized that the subject was looking at his eyes rather than into them as
previously  there were now smeared footprints on the glass 
every few seconds orin wiped the steam of his breath away from the thick glass to see what the faces were doing 
his foot really was hurt  and the remains of whatever had made him fall asleep so hard really were making him sick to his
stomach  and in sum this experience was pretty clearly not one of his bad dreams  but orin       was in deep denial about its not
being a dream  it was like the minute he d come to and found himself inside a huge inverted tumbler he d opted to figure  dream 
the stilted amplified voice that came periodically through the small screen or vent above him  demanding to know where is the
master buried  was surreal and bizarre and inexplicable enough to orin to make him grateful  it was the sort of surreal
disorienting nightmarish incomprehensible but vehement demand that often gets made in really bad dreams  plus the bizarre
anxiety of not being able to get the adoring subject to acknowledge anything he said through the glass  when the speaker s screen
slid back  orin looked away from the glass s faces and up  figuring that they were going to do something even more surreal and
vehement that would really nail down the undeniable dream status of the whole experience 
mile  luria p           who disdained the subtler aspects of technical interviews and had lobbied simply to be given a pair of
rubber gloves and two or three minutes alone with the subject s testicles  and who was not really swiss   had predicted accurately
what the subject s response would be when the speaker s screen was withdrawn and the sewer roaches began pouring blackly and
shinily through  and as the subject splayed itself against the tumbler s glass and pressed its face so flat against the absurd glass s
side that the face changed from green to stark white  and  much muffled  shrieked at them  do it to her  do it to her    luria p        inclined her head and rolled her eyes at the a f r  leader  whom she had long regarded as something of a ham 
human beings came and went  an r n  felt his forehead and yanked her hand back with a yelp  somebody down the hall was
jabbering and weeping  at one point chandler f   the recently graduated nonstick cookware salesman  seemed to be there in the
classic resident confiteor position  his chin on his hands on the bedside crib railing  the room s light was a glowing gray  the
ennet house house manager was there  fingering the place her missing eyebrow d been  trying to explain something about how
pat m  hadn t come because she and mr  m  d had to kick pat s little girl out of the house for using something synthetic again  and
was in a too shaky place spiritually to even leave home  gately felt physically hotter than he d ever felt  it felt like a sun in his
head  the crib type railings got tapered on top and writhed a little  like flames  he imagined himself on the house s aluminum
platter with an apple in his mouth  his skin glazed and crispy  the m d  that looked age twelve appeared with others wreathed in
mist and said up it to    q   and let s try doris        that the poor son of a bitch was burning down  he wasn t talking to
gately  the m d  was not addressing don gately  gately s only conscious concern was asking for help to refuse demerol  he
kept trying to say addict  he remembered being young on the playground and telling maura duffy to look down her shirt and spell
attic  somebody else said ice bath  gately felt something rough and cool on his face  a voice that sounded like his own brainvoice with an echo said to never try and pull a weight that exceeds you  gately figured he might die  it wasn t calm and peaceful
like alleged  it was more like trying to pull something heavier than you  he heard the late gene fackelmann saying to get a load of
this  he was the object of much bedside industry  a brisk clink of i v  bottles overhead  slosh of bags  none of the overhead
voices talking to him  his input unrequired  part of him hoped they were putting demerol in his i v without him knowing  he
gurgled and mooed  saying addict  which was the truth  that he was  he knew  the crocodile that liked to wear hanes  lenny  that
at the podium liked to say  the truth will you set you free  but not until it s done with you   the voice down the hall was weeping
like its heart would break  he imagined the a d a  with his hat off earnestly praying gately would live so he could send him to
m d c  walpole  the harsh sound he heard up close was the tape around his unshaved mouth getting ripped off him so quick he
hardly felt it  he tried to avoid projecting how his shoulder would feel if they started pounding on his chest like they pound on
dying people s chests  the intercom calmly dinged  he heard conversing people in the hall passing the open door and stopping for
a second to look in  but still conversing  it occurred to him if he died everybody would still exist and go home and eat and x their
wife and go to sleep  a conversing voice at the door laughed and told somebody else it was getting harder these days to tell the
homosexuals from the people who beat up homosexuals  it was impossible to imagine a world without himself in it  he remem 

 bered two of his beverly high teammates beating up a so called homosexual kid while gately walked away  wanting no part of
either side  disgusted by both sides of the conflict  he imagined having to become a homosexual in walpole  he imagined going
to one meeting a week and having a shepherd s crook and parrot and playing cribbage for a cigarette a point and lying on his side
in his bunk in his cell facing the wall  jacking off to the memory of tits  he saw the a d a  with his head bowed and his hat
against his chest 
somebody overhead asked somebody else if they were ready  and somebody commented on the size of gately s head and
gripped gately s head  and then he felt an upward movement deep inside that was so personal and horrible he woke up  only one
of his eyes would open because the floor s impact had shut the other one up plump and tight as a sausage  his whole front side of
him was cold from lying on the wet floor  fackelmann around somewhere behind him was mumbling something that consisted
totally of g s 
his open eye could see the luxury apt  window  it was dawn outside  a glowing gray  and birds had plenty to say out in the
bare trees  and at the big window was a face and a windmill of arms  gately tried to adjust the vertical hold on his vision  pamela
hoffman jeep was at the window  their apt  was on the second floor of the luxury complex  she was up in a tree right outside the
window  standing on a branch  looking in  either gesturing wildly or trying to keep her balance  gately felt a rush of concern about
her falling out of the tree and was preparing to ask the floor to maybe please relax its hold a second and let him go when p h  j  s
face suddenly fell and exited the bottom of the window and was replaced by the face of bobby   c   c  bobby c raised a slow
two finger salute to his temple in an impassively mocking hello as he scanned the evidence of serious bingeing in the room 
through the window  eyeballing mt  dilaudid with special attention  nodding down to somebody down under the tree  he edged
forward on the branch until he was right up flush with the window and pushed up on its frame with one hand  trying to open the
locked window  the rising sun behind him cast a shadow of his head against the wet floor  gately called out to fackelmann and
tried to roll and sit up  his bones felt full of busted glass  bobby c held up a six pack of hefenreffer and waggled it suggestively 
like wanting in  gately had just managed to sit partly up when c s fist in its fingerless glove came through the window  spraying
double pane glass  the fallen tp screen continued to show shots of small flames  gately could see  c s arm came through and
groped for the latch and raised the window  fackelmann was bleating like a sheep but not moving  a syringe he hadn t bothered
with removing hung from the inside of his elbow  gately saw bobby c had glass in his purple hair and a vintage taurus pt   mm 
jammed into his spike studded belt  gately sat there dumbly as c clambered on in and kind of tiptoed through the various puddles
and rolled fackelmann s head back to check his pupils  c clucked his tongue and let fackelmann s head fall back against the wall 
fax still softly bleating  he turned smartly on his boot s heel and started across toward the apartment door  and gately sat there
looking at him  when he got to where gately was sitting on the floor with his wet legs curved parenthesized out in front of him
like some sort of huge pre verbal rug rat c stopped as if to say something he d just remembered  looking down at gately  his smile
wide and warm  and gately noticed he had a black front tooth just as c caught him over the ear with the taurus pt and put him
back down  the floor got the back of gately s head worse than the gun butt did  his ears belled  it wasn t stars he saw  then
bobby c kicked gately in the balls  s o p  to keep your man down  and gately drew his knees up and turned his head and was
sick out onto the floor  he heard the apartment door opening and the leisurely sound of c s boots going down the stairs to the
complex s door  between spasms  gately urged fackelmann to go for the window as rickety tick as he could  fack elmann was
slumped back against the wall  he was looking at his legs and saying he couldn t feel his legs  that he was numb from the scalp on
down and climbing 
c returned shortly  and at the head of a whole entourage type group of people gately didn t like the looks of at all  there were
desmonts and pointgrave  canadian harvard square small time thug types gately knew slightly  small time freelancers  too
canadianly dumb for anything but the brutalest work  gately was unglad to see them  they wore overalls and nonmatching
flannel shirts  the poor eczematic pharmacist s assistant guy was behind them  carrying a black dr  bag  gately was on his back
pedalling his legs in the air  which is what anybody that s played organized ball knows is what you do for a brody to the groin  the
pharmacist s assistant stopped behind c and stood there looking at his own weejuns  three big unfamiliar girls entered in red
leather coats and badly laddered hose  then poor old pamela hoffman jeep  her taffeta torn and stained and her face gray with
shock  got borne in through the door by two oriental punks in shiny leather jackets  they had their hands under her ass and
carried her as if seated  one leg out and a white stick of bone protruding from her shin  which her shin was a serious mess  gately
saw all this upside down  pedalling his legs until he could get up  one of the big girls carried an old type graphix bong and a glad
cinch sak kitchen can bag  either pointgrave or desmonts   gately could never remember which of them was who   carried a
case of bonded liquor  c asked generally if it was party time  the room brightened as the sun climbed  the room was filling up 
another of the girls made negative comments about the urine on the floor  fackelmann in the corner began saying it was all a
goddamned lie  c pretended to answer himself in a falsetto and said yes indeedyweedy it was party time  now a very bland
groomed collegeish guy in a wembley tie entered with a tatung corp  box and put it down by where the pharmacist s assistant
was still standing  and the bland guy rehung the teleplayer on the wall and ejected the tp s small flame cartridge  dropping it on
the wet floor  the two oriental toughs carried pamela hoffman jeep over to a far corner of the living room  and she screamed
when they dropped her onto a box of counterfeit little commonwealth of ma peel off seals  they were small  the orientals  and
they were looking down at him  but neither had bad skin  a small grim woman with a tight gray bun and sensible shoes entered
last and shut the apt  door behind her  gately rolled slowly to his knees and stood up  still bent a bit at the waist  not moving  one
eye still swollen shut  he could hear fackelmann trying to stand  p h  j  stopped shrieking and blacked out and slumped down
until her chin was on her chest and her ass half off the box  the room smelled like dilaudid and urine and gately s vomit and
fackelmann s bowel movement and the red leather girls s fine leather coats  c came on over and reached up and put his arm
around gately s shoulders and stood with him like that while two of the tough girls in their coats passed around bottles of bourbon
from the case  gately could focus best when he squinted  the a m  sun hung in the window  up and past the tree  yellowing  the
bottles were the black labelled boxy bottles that signified jack daniels  a churchbell off in the square struck seven or eight 
gately had had a bad experience with jack daniels at age fourteen  the bland groomed corporate guy had inserted a different tp
cartridge and now was getting a portable cd player out of the tatung box while the pharmacist s assistant watched him 
fackelmann said whatever it was was a total goddamn lie  pointgrave or desmonts took the bottle c had taken from the tough

 girls and handed to gately  the sunlight on the floor through the window was spidered with shadows of branches  everybody in
the room s shadows were moving around on the west wall  c also held a bottle  soon just about everybody had their own
individual bottle of jack  gately heard fackelmann asking somebody to open his for him he was numb to the ceiling and climbing
and he couldn t feel his hands  the small grim librarianish woman went to fackelmann  removing her purse from her shoulder 
gately was figuring out what he was going to say on the faxter s behalf when whitey sorkin arrived  until then he figured it was
c s party and just not to unnecessarily rile c  it seemed to take a long time to formulate mental thoughts  pamela hoffman jeep s
shin looked like ground chuck  c lifted his square bottle and asked for general permission to like propose a toast  p h  j  s lips
were blue with shock  gately felt bad that he felt so little romantic concern now that she d fallen out of the tree  he spent no time
wondering if she d ratted them out  if she d brought bobby c to them or vice versy  at least one of the girls in the red leather coats
had an awful big adam s apple for a girl  c roughly turned gately s shoulders toward fackelmann in the corner and toasted to old
friends and new friends and what looked like a serious fucking a score for gene gene the fax machine  given the size of this
dilaudid pile and all the evidence of some serious fucking partying they could see  and smell  everyone drank from their bottle 
the grim faced little woman had to help fackelmann find his mouth with the mouth of his bottle  all three of the big women
displayed adam s apples when they tilted way back to chug  the polite swallow of jack almost made gately heave  c s item in his
belt pressed against gately s thigh and so did some of the belt s spikes  desmonts and pointgrave both had s w items in
shoulder holsters  the oriental punks didn t display any arms but had a look about them like they didn t ever even shower
unarmed  safe bet they at least had little weird sharp chinky things you threw at people  gately figured  several of c s group
chugged their whole bottle  one of the big girls hurled her bottle at the west wall  but it didn t break  why is it you feel it in your
gut and not your nuts per se  when you get brodied  gately was turning and looking wherever c s arm was turning him  the
contorted face on the rehung viewer from the corporate guy s cartridge was whitey sorkin s  a portrait sorkin had let some
neuralgic painter do of him having a cluster headache out at the national cranio facial pain foundation in the city  for a series for
an ad for aspirin  the cartridge seemed like just a continuous still of the painting  so that it looked like sorkin on the wall was sort
of presiding over the gathering in a mute pained way  the librarianish little woman was threading a sewing needle with thread  her
mouth real tight  the pharmacist s assistant was getting little skin flakes all over the black bag as he hunkered down over the bag
removing several syringes from the bag and filling them out of a      iu ampule and handing them up to be passed around  the
n c  f p f  painting had a red fist pulling a handful of brain out of the top of sorkin s skull while sorkin s face looked out of the
viewer with the classic migraine sufferer s look of super intense thought  almost more meditative than hurt looking  one oriental
kid was squatting chinkishly in the corner drinking jack and the other was sweeping up spilled laminates off the floor  using a flap
from the tatung box for a dustpan  chinks could do some serious sweeping  gately reflected  another of the girls threw her
bottle at the wall  it was when c didn t even have gately facing them that it dawned on gately the girls in coats and slatternly hose
were fags dressed up as girls  like as in transvestals  bobby c was beaming  the first bit of real personal ass fear gately felt was
when he realized these people looked like mostly members of bobby c s personal set  that they weren t the people sorkin would
dispatch if he was sending his own people and coming himself  soon  that sorkin s painting on the wall was symbolic of sorkin
wasn t coming  that sorkin had given bobby c free rain on this piece of painful business  the pharmacist s assistant removed two
pre filled syringes from the bag  unwrapping their crinkly plastic  c told gately quietly how whitey said to say he knew bonnie
wasn t part of fackelmann s score to fuck sorkin and eighties bill  that he didn t need to do anything except kick back and enjoy
the party and let fackelmann face his own music and to not let any like   th century notions of defending the weak and pathetic
drag gately into this  c said he was sorry about the bit of the beating  he had to make sure gately didn t try and get fackelmann
out the window while he was down unlocking the door  that he hoped gately wouldn t hold it against him  cause he wished him
no particular ill and wanted no beef  later  this was all said very quietly and intensively while the two fags in wigs that had tried
to break bottles were sitting on a box filling the graphix s huge party bowl with grass from the glad bag  which contained grass 
desmontes sat in a director s chair  everybody else was drinking out of their square bottle  standing around the sunny room in the
awkward postures of way more people than seats  their arms were pale and hairless  the two oriental toughs were tying each
other off  the draft through the fist hole in the window made gately shiver  the other fag was making like comments about
gately s physique  gately asked c quietly if he and fackelmann couldn t get cleaned up real quick and they could all go see
sorkin together and whitey and gene could reason together and work out an accord  fackelmann found his voice and asked
loudly if anybody wanted to hike on over here to mt  dilaudid and get fucking fucked up  gately winced  bobby c smiled at
fackelmann and said it looked like fax had had about enough  but at the same time the psoriatic assistant came to fackelmann
and checked his pupils with a penlight and then shot him up with a pre filled  using an artery in his neck  the back of
fackelmann s head hit the wall several times  his face flushing violently in the standard clinical reaction to narcan        the
pharmacist then came c and gately s way  the portable cd player started in with poor old linda mccartney as c held gately and
the asst  pharmacist tied him off with an m d  s rubber strap  gately stood there slightly hunched  fackelmann was making sounds
like a long submerged man coming up for air  c told gately to fasten his seatbelt  urine had turned part of the apt  s luxuryhardwood floor s finish soft and white  like soap scum  the cd playing was one c d played all the fucking time in the car when
gately had been with him in a car  somebody had taken an old disk of mccartney and the wings   as in the historical beatles s
mccartney   taken and run it through a kurtzweil remixer and removed every track on the songs except the tracks of poor old
mrs  linda mccartney singing backup and playing tambourine  when the fags called the grass  bob  it was confusing because
they also called c  bob   poor old mrs  linda mccartney just fucking could not sing  and having her shaky off key little voice
flushed from the cover of the whole slick multitrack corporate sound and pumped up to solo was to gately unspeakably
depressing   her voice sounding so lost  trying to hide and bury itself inside the pro backups  voices  gately imagined mrs  linda
mccartney   in his staff room s wall s picture a kind of craggy faced blonde   imagined her standing there lost in the sea of her
husband s pro noise  feeling low esteem and whispering off key  not knowing quite when to shake her tambourine  c s depressing
cd was past cruel  it was somehow sadistic seeming  like drilling a peephole in the wall of a handicapped bathroom  two of the
transvestals were doing the swim to the awful tape in the swept center of the floor  the other had one of fackelmann s arms while
the bland guy in the wembley tie gripped fack elmann s other arm and was slapping fackelmann lightly as the dilaudid fought
the narcan  they d seated fackelmann in his corner in gately s special demerol chair  gately s balls throbbed with his pulse  the

 pharmacist s assistant s face was right up in gately s  his cheeks and chin were a mess of silvery scaly flakes  and an oily sweat on
his forehead caught the window s sunlight as he gave gately a tight smile 
 i m pretty much straight already  c man  after that nut shot   gately said   if you don t want to waste the narcan  
 oh this isn t no narcan   c said softly  holding gately s arm 
 hadly   said the assistant  uncapping the syringe 
c said  hold on to your hat   he poked the assistant s shoulder   tell him  
 it s pharm grade sunshine         the assistant said  tapping for a good vein 
 hold on to your heart   c said  watching the needle go in  the pharmacist slid it in expertly  horizontal and flush to the skin 
gately had never done sunshine  next to ungettable outside a canadian hospital  he watched his own blood ruddle the serum as
the pharmacist extended his thumb to ease the plunger back  the pharmacist s assistant could really boot  c s tongue was in the
corner of his mouth as he watched  the corporate guy had fackelmann s arms held tight and a transvestal who d gotten in behind
the chair held his head by the chin and hair as the gray lady knelt before him with her threaded needle  gately couldn t keep
himself from watching the stuff go in him  there was no pain  he wondered for a second if it was a hot shot  it seemed like a
whole lot of trouble to go to just to get him off  the pharmacist s thumbnail was ingrown  there were a couple eczema flakes on
gately s arm where the guy was inclined over it  you get to like the sight of your own blood after a while  the pharmacist had him
half booted when fackelmann started screaming  the scream s pitch got higher as it drew out  when gately could look away from
the stuff going in  he saw the librarian type lady was sewing fackelmann s eyelids open to the skin above his eyebrows  as in they
were sewing poor old count faxula s eyes open  a kid on the playground had used to turn his lids inside out at girls like they were
doing now to the poor old faxter  gately gave a reflexive jerk toward him  and c hugged him tight with one arm 
 easy   c said very softly 
the taste of the hydrochloride in the sunshine was the same  delicious  the taste of the smell of every dr  s office everywhere 
he d never done talwin px  impossible to get scrips for  the px  a canadian blend  u s  talwin s       got    mg  of naloxone
mixed in  to cut the buzz  is why gately only did nx on top of barn bams  he understood they d given fackelmann the anti narc
so he d feel the needle as they sewed his eyes open  cruel is spelled with a u  he remembered  the two orientals left the room at
c s direction  linda mcc  sounded borderline psychotic  the little gray lady worked fast  the eye that was already sewed open
bulged obscenely  everybody in the room except c and the corporate guy and grim lady started shooting dope  two of the fags
had their eyes shut and their faces at the ceiling as if they couldn t take watching what they were doing to their arm  the
pharmacist was tying off the passed out pamela hoffman jeep  which seemed like insult   injury  there was every different kind
of style and skill level of injection and boot going on  fackelmann s face was still a scream face  the corporate tool type was
dropping fluid from a pipette into fackelmann s sewed open eye while the lady rethreaded the needle  it was just seeming to
gately he d seen the fluid in eye thing in a cartridge or movie the m p  d liked when he was a bim playing ball on the chintz in the
sea when the sunshine crossed the barrier and came on 
you could see why the u s  made them cut the buzz  the air in the room got overclear  a glycerine shine  colors brightening
terribly  if colors themselves could catch fire  the word on the c ii talwin px was it was intense but short acting  and pricey  no
word on its interaction with massive residual amounts of i v  dilaudid  gately tried to figure while he still could  if they were
going to eliminate his map with an o d  they d have used something cheap  and if the librarian was going to sew his eyes open 
gately was trying to think  too they wouldn t have got him  him  got him off 
the very air of the room bulged  it ballooned  fackelmann s screams about lies rose and fell  hard to hear against the arterial
roar of the sun  mcc  was trying to muffle a cough  gately couldn t feel his legs  he could feel c s arm around him taking more
and more of his weight  c s arms s muscles rising and hardening  he could feel this  his legs were  like  opting out  attack of
floors and sidewalks  kite used to sing a ditty called     uses for sterno me lad   c was starting to let him down easy  strong
squat hard kid  most heroin men you can knock down with a boo  c  there was a gentleness about c  for a kid with the eyes of a
lizard  he was letting him down real easy  c was going to protect bimmy don from the bad floor s assault  the supported swoon
spun gately around  c moving around him like a dancer to slow the fall  gately got a rotary view of the whole room in almost
untakable focus  pointgrave was vomiting chunkily  two of the fags were sliding down the wall they had their backs to  their red
coats were aflame  the passing window exploded with light  or else it was desmontes that was vomiting and pointgrave was
taking the tp s viewer off the wall and stretching its fibroid wire over toward fackelmann against the wall  one of fax s eyes was
as open as his mouth  disclosing way more eye than you ever want to see on somebody  he was no longer struggling  he stared
piratically straight ahead  the librarian was starting on his other eye  the bland man had a rose in his japel and he d put on glasses
with metaj lenses and was blind high and missing fax s eye with the dropper half the time  saying something to pointgrave  a
transvestal had p h  j  s torn hem hiked up and a spiderish hand on her flesh colored thigh  p h  j  s face was gray and blue  the
floor came up slowly  bobby c s squat face looked almost pretty  tragic  half lit by the window  tucked up under gately s spinning
shoulder  gately felt less high than disembodied  it was obscenely pleasant  his head left his shoulders  gene and linda were both
screaming  the cartridge with the held open eyes and dropper had been the one about ultra violence and sadism  a favorite of
kite  gately thinks sadism is pronounced  saddism   the last rotating sight was the chinks coming back through the door  holding
big shiny squares of the room  as the floor wafted up and c s grip finally gave  the last thing gately saw was an oriental bearing
down with the held square and he looked into the square and saw clearly a reflection of his own big square pale head with its eyes
closing as the floor finally pounced  and when he came back to  he was flat on his back on the beach in the freezing sand  and it
was raining out of a low sky  and the tide was way out

james o  incandenza  a filmography 
the following listing is as complete as we are able to make it  because the twelve years of incandenza s directorial activity also coincided with
large shifts in film venue   from public art cinemas  to vcr capable magnetic recordings  to interlace telentertainment laser dissemination and
reviewable storage disk laser cartridges   and because incandenza s output itself comprises industrial  documentary  conceptual  advertorial 
technical  parodic  dramatic noncommercial  nondramatic   anti confluential   noncommercial  nondramatic commercial  and dramatic commercial
works  this filmmaker s career presents substantive archival challenges  these challenges are also compounded by the facts that  first  for
conceptual reasons  incandenza eschewed both l  of c  registration and formal dating until the advent of subsidized time  secondly  that his

 output increased steadily until during the last years of his life incandenza often had several works in production at the same time  thirdly  that his
production company was privately owned and underwent at least four different changes of corporate name  and lastly that certain of his highconceptual projects  agendas required that they be titled and subjected to critique but never filmed  making their status as film subject to
controversy 
accordingly  though the works are here listed in what is considered by archivists to be their

of the shed s objay darts  and one of the reasons why they regale the e t a s only when hal s down there at the unexamined life is that hal is
the only e t a  who seems truly interested  which is the sort of thing your veteran off duty cop can always sense  e g  one of the objay darts
they re into is the lady who sits very still with her eyes closed  the cops explain that the lady is not catatonic in the strict sense of catatonic but
rather a  d p    which is mental health facility slang for debilitatingly phobic  her deal is apparently that she s almost psychotically terrified of the
possibility that she might be either blind or paralyzed or both  so e g  she keeps her eyes shut tight          out of the reasoning that as long as
she keeps her eyes shut tight she can find hope in the possibility that if she was to open them she d be able to see  they say  but that if she were
  

 ever to actually open her eyes and actually not be able to see  she reasons  she s lost that precious like margin of hope that she s maybe not blind 
then they run through her similar reasoning behind sitting absolutely motionless out of a phobia of being paralyzed  after each anecdote tale like

from one side of his mouth to the other as he holds his snifter tight in both hands and makes his jowls accordionize as he nods and posits that the
terrifying thing is that the common unifying symptom of most of the shed s objay darts is a terror so terrifying it makes the object of the terror
come true  somehow  which observation always makes both of the big dim workingmen shiver an identical and kind of almost delicious looking

one of the graduate prorectors  little tasks is supposedly to go around to different subdorm floors and check the rooms for things like are the
beds made up drum tight  with unpleasant little extra drills added to the regimens of bed making and toothpaste cap replacing slackers  though
few of the prorectors have the combination anality and drive actually to go around to their assigned rooms with a checklist  the exceptions being
aubrey delint  mary esther thode  and the hatchet faced kenyan tony nwangi  who s got the pemulis troeltsch schacht suite under extremely

hal s private dread is that tavis will want him to offer up his personal competitive map and dignity to john   n r    wayne   who s never in
several matches lost more than three games in a set to hal   for the titillation of the alumni and patrons at the november fundraiser gala s
exhibitions  though this is pretty unlikely right before the what aburger  when hal ll be apt to face wayne in the semis anyway  and schtitt isn t apt
to want an utter demapping that fresh in hal s mind right before a major event 
  
hal incandenza had been thought for a while as a toddler to have some sort of attention deficit disorder   partly because he read so fast and
spent so little time on each level of various pre cd rom video games  partly because just about any upscale kid even slightly to port or starboard
of the bell curve s acme was thought at that time to have a d d    and for a while there d been a certain amount of specialist shuttling  and many
of the specialists were veterans of mario and were preconditioned to see hal as also damaged  but thanks to the diagnostic savvy of brandeis s
child development center the damage assessments were not only retracted but reversed way out to the other side of the damaged to gifted
continuum  and for much of the glabrous part of his childhood hal d been classified as somewhere between  borderline gifted  and  gifted   
though part of this high cerebral rank was because b c d c  s diagnostic tests weren t quite so keen when it came to distinguishing between raw
neural gifts and the young hal s mono maniacally obsessive interest and effort  as if hal were trying as if his very life were in the balance to please
some person or persons  even though no one had ever even hinted that his life depended on seeming gifted or precocious or even exceptionally
pleasing   and when he d committed to memory entire dictionaries and vocab check software and syntax manuals and then had gotten some
chance to recite some small part of what he d pounded into his ram for a proudly nonchalant mother or even a by this time as far as he wasconcerned pretty much out there father  at these times of public performance and pleasure   the weston ma school district in the early b s 
    s had had interschool range of reading and recall spelling beeish competitions called  battle of the books   which these were for hal pretty
much of a public turkey shoot and approval fest   when he d extracted what was desired from memory and faultlessly pronounced it before certain persons  he d felt almost that same pale sweet aura that an lsd afterglow conferred  some milky corona  like almost a halo of approved grace 
made all the milkier by the faultless nonchalance of a moms who made it clear that his value was not contingent on winning first or even second

it s not clear to joelle whether avril even knew this  since jim and avril hadn t been intimate with each other  i e  conjugally  for quite some time

 i fear i simply have to deny the insinuation that it s disloyal or ungrateful to find oneself troubled by certain quite glaring inconsistencies in this
master quote unquote program you all seem to expect us simply to open up and blindly swallow whole and then walk around glazed with our arms
right out straight in front of us parroting  reciting    geoff  geoffrey  man  i don t think anybody s trying to insinuate anything over on you  brother 
i know i ain t trying to  
no  you simply sit there with your arms crossed nodding with that timeless patience that communicates condescension and judgment without
exposing you to responsibility for insinuating anything aloud  
 maybe when i look patient i m really trying to be patient with myself  for not finishing school and etcetera and having a hard time keeping up
with you  
this aa tactic of masking condescension behind humility     
 i guess i m just sorry for you you re feeling frustrated with the program today  i know there s lots of days i m frustrated with it  so i don t know
what to say helpful to you except what they said to me  to just hang in there  
 one day at a one day at a one day  
 brother  that s just all i know to tell you that s worked for me  i know for me it don t matter if there s days i fucking hate it  i just have to do it 
and it don t help me or anybody else if i go around negativing on newcomers and trying to take out my issues on trying to fuck them up with godpuzzles  
 mr  gately sir  i found myself sitting tonight in yet another alcoholics anonymous meeting the central message of which was the importance of
going to still more alcoholics anonymous meetings  this infuriating carrot and donkey aspect of trudging to meetings only to be told to trudge to
still more meetings  
 i hear you  
 as if  i mean  what s supposedly going to be communicated at these future meetings i m exhorted to trudge to that cannot simply be
communicated now  at this meeting  instead of the glazed recitation of exhortations to attend these vague future revelatory meetings  
 i m doing my best to stay with you here day man  
 and tonight i m just settling in in yet another uneven legged chair  cultivating that glazed passive spectatorial state of mind that is clearly what
they re trying to inspire in the ephebe  settling in next to a positively redolent emil m  and trying to hold my poor addled denial ridden mind open
with all available main  listening to this ravaged looking yalie in yellow slacks detail episodes of tremens whose gruesomeness interdicted any
possible identification   
 i m remembering i heard pat tell you that thinking people who are walking ahead of you are following you is a pretty bad kind of d t s  brother  
 and i informed her that there s a well known surveillance tactic known as the box surveillance  which involves certain members of the
surveillance team establishing themselves in front of the subject  
 except i don t ever remember you explaining why a sociology teacher weaving his way from his fourth bar to his fifth bar is important enough
for four guys from some you never mentioned what kind of conspiracy to be pulling this real complex surveillance thing  
     
 except i was interrupting your point you were sharing  i know  and i m sorry  
 your basic decency is why you re whom i bring my thoughts to  don  you know that  
 that makes me feel good day man  
 i mean to whom else might i speak  the girl who takes her eye out and fondles it  poor ewell with his obsessive tattoo charts  lenz 
 it makes me feel good you think i m decent to talk to  that s supposed to be why i m here  i sure needed to talk  at the start  can you
remember where you were headed before i broke i interrupted  
 something this broken ivy leaguer said  some aa sally  he said that only one newcomer in a million actually trudges into an alcoholics
anonymous closed meeting and in fact doesn t belong there  
 meaning doesn t turn out to have the disease you mean  
 yes  and that he said that quote if you   looking right at yours truly  seemingly  with that wearily amused patient expression you all must
practice in front of the mirror   he said that only one newcomer in a million doesn t belong here  and if quote you think you re that one in amillion  you definitely belong here  and everyone howled with mirth  stomped their feet and blew coffee through their noses and wiped their eyes
with the backs of their hands and elbowed each other  howled with mirth  
 but you were  like  unsmiling at it  
 and everyone labels as denial or ingratitude what s actually horror  don  the horror of acknowledging that you do apparently have some sort of
problem with mild sedatives and fine chianti  and wanting with all sincerity to give every fair chance to a treatment modality which millions swear
up and down has helped them with their own problem  
 you re talking about aa  
 to want very much to believe in it  and to try  and then to your horror find the program riddled with these obvious and idiotic fallacies and
reductia ad absurdum which   
tm going to need to ask you to try and say that again in words i can follow  geoffrey  if you want me to be right there alongside with you  and
i m sorry if that seems descending  
 don  i am sincere when i say i m frightened when i find that there are things about this allegedly miraculous program s doctrine that simply do
not follow  that do not cohere  that do not make anything resembling rational sense  
 i m with you on that one now  brother  
 tonight s example of the one in a million  say  don  let me ask you  don  in all earnest  why shouldn t every human being in the world be in
aa  
 now i m not with you anymore again  geoffrey  
  

  don  why doesn t every featherless biped on earth qualify for aa  by aa s reasoning  why isn t everyone everywhere an alcoholic  
 well geoffrey man it s a totally private decision to admit the disease  nobody can go tell another man he s   
 but indulge me for a moment  by aa s own professed logic  everyone ought to be in aa  if you have some sort of substance problem  then you
belong in aa  but if you say you do not have a substance problem  in other words if you deny that you have a substance problem  why then you re
by definition in denial  and thus you apparently need the denial busting fellowship of aa even more than someone who can admit his problem  
 don t look at me like that  show me the flaw in my reasoning  i beg you  show me why not everyone should be in aa  given the way aa regards
those who don t believe they belong there  
 and now you don t know what to say  there s no cockle warming cliche that applies    the slogan i ve heard that might work here is the slogan
analysis paralysis   oh lovely  oh very nice  by all means don t think about the validity of what they re claiming your life hinges on  oh do not ask
what is it  do not ask not whether it s not insane  simply open wide for the spoon  
 for me  the slogan means there s no set way to argue intellectual type stuff about the program  surrender to win  give it away to keep it 
god as you understand him  you can t think about it like an intellectual thing  trust me because i been there  man  you can analyze it til you re
breaking tables with your forehead and find a cause to walk away  back out there  where the disease is  or you can stay and hang in and do the
best you can  
 aa s response to a question about its axioms  then  is to invoke an axiom about the inadvisability of all such questions  
 i ain t aa day man  no one like individual can respond for aa  
 am i out of line in seeing something totalitarian about it  something dare i say un american  to interdict a fundamental doctrinal question by
invoking a doctrine against questioning  wasn t this the very horror the madisonians were horrified of in       amendments i and ix  my
grievance is disallowed because my petition for redress is a priori interdicted by the inadvisability of all petitioning  
 i m about to get fucking lapped here i m so not following  you honestly don t see what s a little whacked out about what you re saying about
denial  
 i m thinking your failure to engage me on the question itself means either i m right  and aa s whole belonging versus denial matrix is
constructed on logical sand  in which case horror  or else it means you re stupefied with condescending pity for me for some reason i fail to grasp 
doubtless because of denial  in which case the look on your face right now is the same weary patience that makes me want to scream in meetings  
 so scream  they can t kick you out  
 how comforting  
 this is a thing i do know  they can t kick you out

an anxiety fest captured nicely by the banner shaped posters delint used to have d  harde put up each fall over the senior locker sections of
both locker rooms that had winners never have to quit until some of the other prorectors went to schtitt and got him to make delint take
them down 
  
it s surely been spelled out already that prorectors teach one marginal class per term and serve as on court assistants to schtitt s
lebensgefahrtin aubrey delint  and that their existence at e t a  is marginal and low prestige and their spiritual state on the low continuum
between embittered and accepting  and for many of the more neurasthenic e t a  students the prorectors are kind of repellent the way hideously
old people are repellent  reminding the students of the kind of low prestige purgatorial fate that awaits the marginal and low ranked jr  player  and
while a couple of the prorectors are feared  none of them is all that much respected  and they re avoided  and stick together with one another and
keep to themselves and seem on the whole sad  with that grad schoolish sense of arrested adolescence and reality avoidance about them

dear filbert  
it s been a quiet week here on mount gawdforsakenb   today is perishing hot  windless  quiet as a tomb  lush and pretty  every floral unit on
the grounds has its pistil aprick and petals atremble in a truly shameless fashion  for the bees are about  the whole hill hums drowsily  yesterday 
your uncle charles was accosted on the north path by a bumblebee that he alleges was so enormous it sounded like a tuba  and he dispatched mr 
harde and the grounds crew with skeet rifles and orders to        bring the sikorski sized bugger down   i shall spare you details of the subsequent
misadventures of the grounds crew  two of whom are now recovering satisfactorily 
the paucity of decibels here is due in part to all six a teams  departure yesterday for milan  with gerhardt  aubrey  carolyn  and urquhart at the
pedagogical tiller  it seems not so many moons ago that we were seeing you  marlon  ross  and the rest off on the european clay junket  i recall
pressing the maternal beak to the terminal window s glass  trying to make my filbert out somewhere behind the airplane s impossible little bullethole windows  i cried like a fool every time  as of course i did all over again yesterday  embarrassing everyone but mario  who also cried 
as for me  i ve swotted and wakked all morning  cranking up your uncle charles s videophone and trying to cajole the editors of various
supermarket trade publications to run m g m  sc latest plea for amending less to fewer m those        express check out lanes  one old editorial
codger said that he d dearly love to help me out but that his newsletter was devoted exclusively to issues of promotional display  when i suggested
that a little comic relief in the form of the l       f bulletin might not be amiss  he chortled  chortling is good  we like chortling  however  i did
manage to twist the arms  harder to do telephonically than one might think  of produce weekly  star market s quarterly register  and
pricechopper s shelf and cart  so the wheels of adjectival justice continue  albeit creakily  to turn 
the very last gobbet of academy news is that your uncle charles had his blood cholesterol tested late last week  though the verdict rendered
was no worse than a rather unperspicuous  normal to upper normal   sic   the penultimate modifier has caused  as you might anticipate  much
pacing and high decibel whingeing  as well as vows of eternal xerophagy from here on out  your uncle charles has already  for some months now 
made a practice of swallowing three teaspoons of fish liver oil just before he hurls the administrative skeleton bedward for the night  your brothers
have taken to trekking over on slow nights to watch him swallow his oil  purely out of enthusiasm for the faces charles makes as the stuff goes
gulletward  i e ordered the poor man a low lipid  artery friendly cookbook as a sort of whatthehell present the day the results came in  and your
uncle charles has already pored over the thing and marked several yummers  we re to have a swot at cabbage patties tonight  fast laners that we
are  i do suppose the poor man will find a way to ladle rice brand into his toothpaste before this spasm of angst subsides  bless his heart   as it
were 
my  this machine does let one maunder on  i d best get back to harrying grocers  one of this fall s matriculates  is the son of a man who s
apparently become an immensely wealthy telegrocerf in the upper midwest  so perhaps the express lane solecism issue will simply disappear in

 just a theory  just tossing it out for the machine s consideration  
 a practice to be encouraged  this particular theory s unfortunately a dink  plus i don t think you quite meant proviso   
 number   remains a no miss proposal  though  picture this  obtain a ring  as in a wedding band  so you present yourself to the subject as
visibly married  
 you know i hate these strategy calls  
 also of course works if you really do happen to be married  in which case you ve got a ring already  
tm sitting here soaking my ankle  o  
 the object being  to present yourself to the subject as married  as in happily married  and you engage her in a conversation in which you make
a big deal of how head over heels in love you are with your wife  how wonderful she is  the wife  how blue and clean the pilot light of passion still
burns in the central heating system of your love for her  your wife  even after all these several years you ve been hitched  
tm sitting here looking through an old box of letters to kill just a very few minutes before a bunch of us climb in the tow truck for pemulis s
annual i  day eve town painting  
 but as you re saying all this to the subject  your manner is nevertheless indicating that you re attracted to her  
 it s poignant somehow that you always use the word subject when you mean the exact obverse  
 but it s not like flirtatious or salivious  your manner  more like just strongly involuntarily attracted  almost as if hypnotized against your will  your
manner can indicate this just by following the subject s conversational movements and changes of posture or facial expression in that sort of
vacant intense way a hungry person watches somebody eating  following the movements of the fork as if memerized  with  of course now  the
occasional flicker of pain and conflict in your eyes  at the fact that here you are involuntarily memerized by somebody other than your serapic wife 
which the point   
 time  yo  i think you mean seraphic  i also think you meant lascivious and mesmerized  
 you know what your problem is  hallie  
 i have just one problem  
 but hang on until you see that   s worth not making me digress away from  though  because the point being to get across how it s an incredible
tribute to the subject s overwhelming female charms that you can even really even see her  the subject  since you re so in love with your wife you
barely even see most women as even female anymore  much less be involuntarily attracted to the subject  much less have maybe the thought of
infidelity skitter no matter how involuntarily across your devoted mind  and it s not like you ll have to volunteer any of this directly  the subject ll
draw the observations on her own  that s the point of the conflicted flickers in your memerized eyes  or at the most an involuntary tortured groan 
a quick bite of the knuckle of the forefinger  
 a heel of the hand to the forehead or something like that  
 get your manner down just conflicted looking enough and the subject herself ll actually start drawing you out on this fact  the involuntary
attraction that s so painful to you and so flattering and tributary to her  
 so wait  this is like a conversation where you re affecting all this flickering and groaning  like you mean a cocktail party small talk
conversation  or do you just brandish your fake ring at some girl at a bus stop and start a tortured tribute to your seraphic wife  
 it takes place anywhere  venue adjustable    s portable and never miss  the point is to maneuver the issue of your devoted attracted conflicted
pain to the point where you can appear to almost sort of break down and can ask the subject in all tortured sincerity if she thinks your involuntarily
finding her so visibly female and attractive makes you a bad husband  display vulnerability and ask her to evaluate the like integrity of your heart 
seem desperate  your whole married self concept shaken  practically beg the subject to reassure you you re not a bad hearted man  plead with the
subject to say what she thinks it might be about her charms that could drive your serapic wife even momentarily from your heart  you present the
attraction you feel for the subject as this involuntary identity threatening soul searing type crisis you just desperately need her help with  the
subject s  person to person  
 sounds very moving  
 and if it so happens you really are married  the additional advantage to   s pitch is that you and the subject both  however briefly  get to believe
it  the pitch  the involuntary passionate doomed knight errant type pitch  
 and of course  o   the subject just happens to be married herself  often with small children  putting her directly in your crosshairs  
 a matter of what s the word personal preference and taste that doesn t impact   s surefire no miss quality one way or the other  it s the doomed
involuntary conflicted good man s downfall type quality that no subject can seemingly resist  
 ainsi  then  
 well o  the thing s sick  it s even sicker than    was it    the one you said that loach inspired  where you d supposedly just that very day
dropped out of jesuit seminary after umpteen years of disciplined celibacy because of carno spiritual yearnings you hadn t even been quite in touch
with as carno spiritual in nature until you just now this very moment laid eyes on the subject  with the breviary and rented collar  
 that was    yes    s pretty much of a gynecopia also  but within a kind of narrower demographic psychological range of potential subjects 
notice i never said   was no miss  
 well you must be a very proud young man  this is even sicker  the fake ring and fictional spouse  it s like you re inventing somebody you love
just to seduce somebody else into helping you betray her  what s it like  it s like suborning somebody into helping you desecrate a tomb they don t
know is empty  
 this is what i get for passing down priceless fruits of hard experience to somebody who still thinks it s exciting to shave  
 i ought to go  i have a blackhead i have to see to  
 you haven t asked why i called right back  why i m calling during high toll hours  
 plus i feel some kind of toothache starting  and it s the weekend  and i want to see schacht before mrs  clarke s confectionery day in the sun
tomorrow  plus i m naked  
 i m surprised you were even there  in person  i was expecting the disembodied voice and asking you to call back asap on this  what is it out
there        why aren t you outside hard at play  don t tell me schtitt started cancelling p m  s for i  day eve  
 i tagged this kid pemberton in the eye up at net  it was inadvertent  we were only four games in  he hit a big soft fluffy goose of an approach
and i was trying to handcuff him  i hit it at him only to handcuff him  he never even got his stick up  right in the left socket  it made a sound like a
champagne cork  a prorector named corbett thorp said he thought pemberton might have detached a retina  something sure seemed detached 
he was walking around in diminishing circles like he d been hit with a mallet  
 you sound really  like  remorse riddled  
 kitchens arid heat  o  i ve taken my share of balls in various spots  and whence bizarre metric theories about emily dickinson all of a sudden  by

 the way  and what s up with the lurking figures with wheelchairs  
 you re a top ten junior stickman suddenly now this year  hallie  what s schtitt doing giving you a cloth mouse like hugh pemberton to bat
around anyway  
 you remember him  
 who could forget a kid that looks like he s curtsying when he serves  with the white visor and the little amber glasses  that kid s been hanging
from the bottom of the ladder by his nails since he was nine  
 it s been carnage all week  schtitt s playing the c teams against the a s  it s for the c s development  donni said  also because today word s
down from the tower some of the staff thought some of the a s looked tentative against port wash  
 they despise tentativity  
 i think they want us just short of cocky for the fundraiser and then the whataburger  where wayne s got a chance to knock this veach kid off
the pole  
 let s not forget you though either  h  i can get down for at least the whataburger semis if you get there  if you want incentive  
 as in in person  o   
 word is you re worth watching now  
 word  
 i keep my ear to the cement  hallie  
 at least for very short subjects  i d imagine  
 we take off for the patriots that friday  what is that like the   th or   th  but it s a saturday afternoon game  i can be down there by midday
sunday if you re still in the thick  
 you ll probably need to wear some sort of sign around your neck so i know it s you  
 so then you ll be up here just as we re down there  oddly  playing  
 it goes without saying you d give me the advance skinny if anybody i didn t want to see was by any chance flying down there with you guys  
 the c versus a thing s been more like grotesque than confidence building  guys are taking out stress in kind of twisted ways  struck beat
gloeckner in    minutes and then made a show of revealing he d had   kilo ankle weights on under his socks  wayne made van slack cry right
there in front of everybody  
 word is wayne has exactly one gear  
 then thursday coyle had his left wrist tied to his right ankle and was still beating this new kid stockhausen until schtitt sent tex watson down
to tell him to knock it off  
 so but the reason i m really calling  hallie  
 and you re being evasive about the dread about the disabled  the like rolling stalkers  
 i haven t seen wheel one in days  i m thinking possibly this was a kind of very shy sort of fan club of people without legs that look up to me   
 grotesque entendre  o  
   as  like  the ultimate leg  they use different ruses to follow me around and never come close or say anything because they re really shy
because they don t have legs  so now my mind s resting easier  
 now if the roach  and spiders at heights fears d subside you could really hold the head high  
 so the reason i m calling  
 i already said i d let you know when and if  no sightings of any journalists  your moment profiler  
 i m actually glad i got you in person  i was going to ask you to call me asap  
tm pleased to call you a sap whenever you like  o  
 that s below you  and i can hear you still chewing that grisly shit  that shit s going to make your lower jaw fall right off  i ve seen it happen
down here  believe me  and you re wondering why the tooth problems all the time suddenly  
 snuff s saliva stimulating  it s actually oral hygiene enhancing  when you factor in all the extra brushing  the caries are himself s legacy  you
know that  the himself whose root canals put dr  zegarelli s kids through andover  
 this basically nonsocial call  h   is because i need your feedback on some issues from these half dozen or so very complex and far ranging and
in depth conversations i had with a certain subject  
 not the mobile home person  surely  
 whole different ballpark of subject  the dickinson theory i have to admit came from these conversations  
 sounds like one deep lady  
 whole levels and dimensions to this one  we ve had a whole series of very intense verbal interchanges  transcendentalist poetics was just one
of the in depth issues ranged over  this subject keeps me on the cerebral toes  
 dickinson s about as transcendentalist as poe  your subject s   for    
 this is all off to the side of the call  i told this subject i d consider certain issues very carefully before i really responded  
 which meant you d consider what she wanted to hear and how to ladle it on until she begs you to have intercourse with her  
 i hence need considered sounding responses to two basic questions  
 why this sick thing of making me complicit in these strategic pursuits when you know i think they re troubled and sick  it s like asking
somebody to help you culture anthrax or something  
 just two questions is all  
 now i m beginning almost to be able to feel my pulse in the tooth  it feels like the infection s gathering force so fast  
 firstly  what does the following word i can t find in the dictionary mean  s a m i z d a t  
 samizdat  russian compound noun  soviet twentieth century idiom  sam   stem   self   izdat   undeclined verb   to publish   i think the literal
denotation s technically archaic  the sub rosa dissemination of politically charged materials that were banned when the eschaton era kremlin was
going around banning things  connotatively  the generic meaning now is any sort of politically underground or beyond the pale press or the stuff
published thereby  there s no real samizdat in the u s  per se  first amendment wise  i don t think  i suppose ultra radical quebecois and albertan
stuff could be considered o n a n ite samizdat  
tow  
 not just separatisteur pamphlets  now  it d have to be more incendiary  materials advocating violence  destruction of property  disruption of
grids  anti o n a n  terrorism and so on  i don t think o n a n  s got technical bans per se  i don t think  but poutrincourt said the r c m p s are
empowered to impound literature and even desktop publishing and interlink hardware et cetera without any sort of warrant  
 r c m p  
 mounties  o  
 the nelson eddy guys in silly hats and equestrian jaspers  
 close enough  next question  
 so you d have no idea why the mad stork s name would come up in connection with somebody saying samizdat  
 this is the second question  
 call it l a   
 not in any strict sense of the term  i guess i could see some separatisteurs trying to read the onantiad or brick as anti reconfiguration films 
maybe stuff like poultry in motion  a lot of himself s stuff was self distributed  too  and immanent domain s allegedly on one level an allegory about
the concavity  though that overlooks that gentle wasn t even president when the thing came out  but you can tell your subject that himself s work

 was all very self consciously american  his interest in politics was subordinate to form  always  and none of it s banned  whatever s still on the
interlace back menus is inter grid  you can order the onantiad in manitoba  vera cruz  anywhere  
 speaking of quebec separatism  interestingly  
 why do i get a sinking feeling this is going to be l a  point one or something  maybe i could call you back tomorrow and we could chat on and
on  i m going to be here reading for boards till the eschaton at       holiday tolls are low  
 it s my nickel  here  
 or maybe you could simply call the person who s really the person to chat with about all issues canadian  o  
 droll  
 moving right along to question    then   my epsom salts are getting cold  
 the big one is what you d have to say if some tough minded and spectacular subject asked you what you have to say about the way every nuck
separatisteur up there  from the bloc quebecois and fils de montcalm all the way out to the really bug eyed radical fringe type sects and terroristic
cells   
 i m going to have to object to the word nuck  o  
 beg pardon  the issue being why the whole quebec separatisteur collection up there dropped the original quebec independence objective like a
rock and switched seemingly overnight to putting everything into agitating against o n a n  and the reconfiguration and forcing the return of the
concavity to our map  
 o   this is o n a n ite politics  i d look my subject right in the big blue eye and tell her straight out that the field of nanomicroscopy is not yet
advanced enough to measure my interest in the intricacies of o n a n ite politics  poutrincourt s class is disquieting enough  the whole thing s
unpleasant and dry and repetitive and mostly dull  thevet has a kind of compelling romanto historical yarn to spin  though  about   
tm serious  you ve had some background  at least  the only nuck prorector we ever got taught ceramics  
 but you re the one with the pleiades and the   on the french achievement boards and the ability to trill your r s  
 that s parisian  and now i don t even watch the sports summaries  much less the political stuff  just try for just one second  this subject raised
issues that were way out of my depth  
 that s not even coherent enough to be a mixed metaphor  o  are you honestly telling me you want your depth increased  or are you just
looking for some cliff note summary so you can incorporate the impression of depth into some new panty removal campaign  are you going to tell
her you studied o n a n ite politics under the jesuits  
 the whole thing was dicey  i had to tell the subject that i had to think about it and ponder  that i always took time to ponder at depth before i
just dashed off an opinion  
 and don t tell me  this is your moment profiler  your boswell in an e cup  is this why she s en route  was the whole familio historical profile
story last week a dodge  am i really just supposed to sit down with her and paint you now as a political minded ex seminarian who s married to
someone only some sort of heroically proportioned goddess could tempt you to betray  because i ll tell you right now that schtitt s not going to let
any of us here talk to anybody from some glossy rag like moment without him or delint sitting right there with us  gone are the days of himself not
caring how many who s the next venus williams hype journalists haunt the grounds  man  schtitt s now calling the shots on who talks to whom 
delint has a whole scathing appendix to the admissions manual about junior development and toxic hype  
 helen ll be able to get in  
 schtitt s not going to let me hype your political acuity or pseudo wife or anything else  he s got c t  seeing this place as a sort of prophylactic
against commercial attention  he thinks junior commercial attention s deforming  the manual now invites us to see ourselves as in utero and hype
as thalidomide  schtitt ll let her in and stick her in with c t  and let c t  filibuster her till she throws herself out the window like that journalist from
conde nast last fall  
 forget the profile  speak to her or don t  this is personal  
 meaning you ve discovered she has small children and maybe a marriage you can deform  
 i m ignoring all this  helen s a different sort of subject  i ve discovered levels and dimensions to helen that have nothing to do with profiles  
 meaning she s a tough nut  meaning you ve set your crosshairs and she hasn t succumbed  and she knows you re not married and not a
tormented jesuit  she s strategy resistant because she knows too much to fall for a persona  
 co ponder with me a second  if you re through  stop me at any time  jump right in at any time  on both the ultra left and  right  the brass ring
up there has always been independent secession for quebec  historically  no  am i off  the fronte liberation and so on  the fils de montcalm  or
is it maybe du  are they the ones in spandex and pancake makeup  the giant pies dropped on ottawa after the third meech lake accord  
 parizeau et all and so on  feel free to stop me or jump in  it all d been about getting quebec out of canada  right  the meech lake and
charlottetown revolts  the cretien assassination   notre rai pays   terrorists in plaid flannel  french canada for the fran cophonic  acadian
zionism   la quebecois toujours    on ne parle d anglais ici    
 with all the terrorism especially directed at ottawa  pressure on ottawa and canada   permettez nous partir  permettez nous etre   or we blow
up the frontenac  or we irradiate winnipeg  or we put a railroad spike through cretien s eye  this is not exactly deep depth  o  
 yes and then but suddenly everything changes when ottawa  under duress or no  puts itself under the surgically sterile like thumb of o n a n  
with the advent of o n a n   gentle  quote unquote experialism  
 you don t sound like you need any input from me on all this  o  
 but so but then in immediate unison all the various different separatist groups drop secession and independence like rocks and all transfer their
insurgent resentment to o n a n  and the u s   and now insurge against o n a n  on behalf of the same canada they d spent decades treating like
the enemy  does this seem a little bit odd  
t
 
 doesn t this seem a little odd  hallie  
 i m really the wrong blood relative to ask about the intricacies of the canadian radical mind  o  we have a blood relative who s got dual
citizenship  if you recall  who i m sure d be overjoyed to ponder separatist ideological flux with you all you want and then some  i m sure  once her
jaw recovered from being unhinged by joy that you actually called  
 i m slapping not one but both knees at the dro  
   d you know she s never once asked me whether booboo and i hear from you  not once  a sort of appalled pride  she s ashamed of even
hurting over it  some   
 kidding all off to the side  i m serious about this  the oddness of it  you know i respect your frontal lobes  hallie  i m asking for depth  not any
kind of expertise  
 you just ignored the meat of everything i just said  you re like an old person about this  with an old person s weird selective hearing  
 i m going to let this whole pot insulting the kettle on selective awareness of things just slide right on by  as a gesture that this is a serious call 
why they all seemingly with one mind switched objectives  
 and acting on behalf of the whole of canada  quebec  suddenly  is what you want explained  or do you simply want it confirmed as odd  
 the subject cited polls from when they were still bothering to take polls up there that said like upwards of four fifths of all canadians wanted
out of o n a n  and hoped president gentle had a ghastly accident in his uv booth  et cetera  
 so the second and final question concerns this shift from anti canadian quebecer nationalism to anti o n a n  canadian nationalism  
 what i was thinking is is this maybe a textbook case of johnny gentle type find an enemy for a divided nation to come together by blamingand hating theory in action  is this somehow quebec like circling its wagons with alberta and all the other provinces in the face of a common

 enemy  
     
 hal  
 you could always point out to the profiler that there s a nice little irony to gentle s strategy ending up bringing canada together at our expense 
when it was pretty obviously meant to bring us together at canada s expense  
 but you sound like you think the more deeply pondered response would be something else  
 all i know is some very basic schoolboy history from poutrincourt s class  and from the advantage of occasional contact with the moms  
 hit me  
 the historical record indicates pretty clearly that the one and only nationalism in the quebecois soul is quebecois nationalism  it s been  nous v 
la plupart toujours   and the more so the farther out on the fringes you get  i can t see the separatisteurs considering quebec a true part of
canada any more than lesotho saw itself as part of southaf  poutrincourt keeps thumping the fact that there s no valid comparison between
quebec and our own antebellum south  why do you think meech lake iiih failed  it s because at root they ve never seen themselves as anything
other than hostages of ottawa and the anglophone provinces  even moderate separatisteurs like parizeau spoke of the final surrender on the plains
of abraham as a kind of forced property transfer  the whole original war  as one in which french canadians weren t the losers so much as the
spoils  booty  
 this all checks with the subject s take  
 the impression i get is that quebec s hatred of anglophone canada transcends anything they could work up against o n a n  just mention     
and the moms s lips disappear  pemulis and axford keep coming early and putting a big gothic      on the blackboard before gocmj just to watch
the moms s lips disappear when she comes in and sees it  
 my sense is the subject concurs on the hatred assessment  they want plain out  always have  health care and nafta be damned  that s why
they sabotaged all three meech lake accords  she says  she seems to imply the anti o n a n  thing is some sort of anomalous dodge or
something  
 i ve got to confess a sort of curiosity now about this profiler you just last week were preparing to fend off about himself  not to mention
comparing her to defensive linemen  rubensian was never your type  i didn t think  
     
 plus any subject you re bothering about even giving the impression of depth to  this is more work than your type of subject tends to demand 
usually  isn t it  

     

 this is something else that isn t you  you ve never exactly been shy about discussing subjects with me  
 it s complex  she s grown on me  
 it s this certain way she takes notes on your explanation of coffin corner punts  
 it s complicated  there s a lot i m not saying  she s got levels  i ve discovered levels and dimensions to her i didn t know were originally there  
 oh o   please don t let it just be you ve just discovered she s married with little kids 
that s not it by any chance is it  please let it be something other than little kids  
     
 let it be something other than the hordes of other subjects i ve sat and listened to excruciatingly detailed sadistic blow by blow strategic
accounts of  orin  home wrecker  incandenza  this is what the team calls you  in like jest  you sick pup  
 i m a sick pup  i m the sick one  
     wants to blame her  won t admit it  needs to  won t admit it  sweepingly blames the whole affair of himself on her  won t interface with her or
worse even acknowledge her  resents even the fact she forgives things like you and marlon bain killing her dog   
   a hit and run and back up and hit again driver  i told you rep  
   pretends he gets the most retardate pr staffer he can make hold the crayon to send grotesque solecistic pseudo impersonal replies to her
pathetic letters  jethro bodine  o   jethro bodine 
 a private chuckle  she d never get it  
 disowns her   worse  sicker  tells himself he s convinced himself she doesn t even exist  as if she never existed  but by some coincidence has
this rapacious fetish for young married mothers he can strategize into betraying their spouses and maybe damaging their kids for all time  and has
this apparently even more rapacious compulsive need to call the blood relative he hasn t even seen in four years and tell him all about every
subject and strategy  blow by blow  long distance  in nanomicroscopic detail  let s stop and ponder this all for a moment  o   what say  
 i m letting all this be just water off a duck s back  i can tell it s the tooth talking  i can remember the stress of the place  all i can say is that
trust me here  this moment subject is like strickenly dissimilar from what you re indicting  the levels and circumstances aren t the ones you re so
anxious to call rapacious  is all i can say at this juncture  
 why do i suspect it s simply that you tried to make the big x with her and she demurred and this simply piqued your interest  during my can tmiss nail interval you were saying how enormous interior linemen were making comments about her bottom being so huge and soft you could
whack it over and over with a car antenna and not hurt it  
 hallie i never said any such fucking thing  you pulled that out of the air  and i m sick  
 you said she was obese  
 i said she was a girl and a half in all directions  which all of a sudden there was something that seemed cross cultural about it  i had this
sudden flash of understanding how cultures can regard largeness as erotic  more of someone to love  not to mention queerly and oddly intense and
alive and vibrant  
 and she declined a casual advance  and showed you pictures of her like enormous offspring  and you came to attention  
 with a heartbreakingly lovely face  too  hal  all peachy and lissome  like big pretty girls get  
tm going to have to keep her away from this kid ortho stice up here  because he really is a rubensophile  after p m s when we sit around he ll
go on and on about enormous breasts and melon bellies and quivering laps until we re all grimacing and pinching our nose bridges  and whatever
you meant was not lissome  
 the reserve qb who s next to me in these godawful pre game costumed swoop and glides said something i liked  helen passed him in the
locker room and he   do you want to hear this  
 she was in the locker room  
 it s the law  the pros aren t a pr gulag  he said she had a face that d break your heart and then also break the heart of whoever like rushed
over to your aid as you pitched over sideways grabbing your chest  
 that is a pretty good one  o  
 but so far we concur on the basic oddness  it sounds like  if the radicals want quebec loose from canada still  and that s always been the
priceless pearl  why like dissipate themselves trying to wreak mayhem down here almost the precise moment interdependence is declared   ce
pas  
 i d rather just agree it s a stumper and then go dry my ankle and find a clean shirt and grab schacht and hit him up for some anbesol before we
hit the truck  
 right  and do these different groups get along  amongst themselves  the different separatist flanges  
 not according to poutrincourt they don t  
 so why then the united concerted switch from like let quebec go or we stick knives in the eyes of canadian vips and drop huge confections on

 rue sherbrooke during st  jean baptiste day to all of a sudden let canada go or we blow up athscme towers and stretch mirrors across u s 
highways and hang fleur de lis banners from u s  monuments and disrupt interlace pulses and skywrite nuck obscenities over buffalo and dicky
with waste vehicle launchers so it rains moose guano on new haven and shoot o n a n ite v i p s on u s  soil and only barely get foiled from
injecting anaerobic toxins into jars of planters peanuts  
 the new haven brown rain thing was sort of a chortle  though  you have to admit  
 chortles are good  we like chortles  but what s the political motivation for the about face  account for this for me  all it has to do is sound
soberly considered  
 orin  i m trying to reconcile your doubtless sincere seriousness about this with your choice of me as co ponderer  
 all  
tm a privileged white seventeen year old u s  male  i m a student at a tennis academy that sees itself as a prophylactic  i eat  sleep  evacuate 
highlight things with yellow markers  and hit balls  i lift things and swing things and run in huge outdoor circles  i am just about as apolitical as
someone can be  i am out of all loops but one  by design  i m sitting here naked with my foot in a bucket  what exactly is it you hope to get from
me on this  i keep losing focus on whether you want a deep sounding line of patter to facilitate xing this fleshy subject or have somehow been
seduced into believing it s really worth pondering the weedy thought processes of fringe canadians  of fringe anybody  how consistent do the
brazilian nuevo contras  objectives look  the noie storkraffs  shining path s  the belgian cccy  pro life assault squads  the ez ed dean elqassan  p e t a  fur farm arsonists  objectives  jesus  gentle and the poor c u s p s  k
 poor c u s p s  
 why not just soberly shrug and invoke the term wacko and leave it at that  why not tell her you re a radically simple and somewhat sick young
man who kicks balls really high in the air for a living  
 all i  
 why not just say who cares  this stuff isn t about you and me  the person this stuff is about is the person you say you ve erased from all ram 
why not tell the damn truth for once  
 me tell the truth  me lie  
 what  this ascapartic bathroom mag journalist is going to give you like an sat entrance test on francophone extremism  like a gyno entrance
exam  you have to place above a certain percentile to get her to let you x her on the floor of the nursery right next to the bassinet  whom are you
trying to kid  whom do you think this is really about  can you be that sick that you can t even admit it over the fucking phone  
 or what  
 i m sorry  o  i apologize  
 think nothing of it  i know you didn t mean it  
 i hate losing the temper  
 you don t sound good  hallie  you sound ground down  
hal grinds at his eye with a finger   these tooth episodes make me feel like that wobbled shrieking figure in that munch lithograph  
 that chew s going to eat right through your membranes  it s a vicious vice  i m urging in all earnest  ask that schacht kid  
michael pemulis cracks hal s door slowly and slowly pokes his head and one shoulder in  saying nothing  he has showered but is still flushed  and
his right eye gets wobbly in this certain way when two or three tenuates are wearing off  he has his yachting cap  gold epaulets of fake naval
braid  and in one ear a piratical gold hoop that lights up in sync with his pulse  with the door just cracked and his head poked in he brings his other
arm in over from behind like it s not his arm  his hand in the shape of a claw just over his head  and makes as if the claw from behind is pulling him
back out into the hall  w  an eye rolling look of fake terror 
hal is hunched  examining his finger for eye material   in all the excitement we ve neglected the most obvious response  then  o  your answer
for the exam  and then i can go dry the ankle   he can hear pemujis asking petropolis kahn and stephan wagenknecht something off down the
hall through the cracked door 
 i think i already tried the obvious response on her  but hit me  
 pemulis just made his first pass and left the door ajar  i m sitting here nude in a draft through an open door neglecting the maybe deceptively
obvious fact that something like  what  three quarters of the concavity s northern border runs contiguous to quebec  
 exactamundo  
 so that so what if ottawa didn t formally subjoin the concavity to any particular province  really big favor  i m sure  because the map speaks for
itself  bits of western new brunswick and a smidgeon of ontario aside  the concavity   the physical fact and fallout of the concavity   it s
quebec s problem  something like     clicks of border along the concavity  with attendant seepage  for notre rai pays  
 yes plus the brunt of the airborne wastes from the high altitude athscmes  plus being the province that gets splatted when the e w d  vehicles
overshoot the concavity  this is what i tried right off the bat on her  
 so what s the puzzle  put yourself in quebec s shoes  once again they get the gooey end of the canadian dipstick  it s mostly now western
quebecer kids the size of volkswagens shlumpfing around with no skulls  it s quebecers with cloracne and tremors and olfactory hallucinations and
infants born with just one eye in the middle of their forehead  it s eastern quebec that gets green sunsets and indigo rivers and grotesquely
asymmetrical snow crystals and front lawns they have to beat back with a machete to get to their driveways  they get the feral hamster incursions
and the infant depredations and the corrosive fogs  
 although people aren t exactly flocking to new brunswick or lake ontario either  and the coastal athscmes send the coastal phenols out over
fundy  and supposedly the lobsters out there are like monsters in old japanese films  and supposedly nova scotia glows  at night  in satellite
photos  
 still and all  o   tell her proportionally speaking it s quebec that s borne the brunt of what canada had to take  the brunt again  to their way of
thinking  remember  small wonder the fringe mentalities are violently anti o n a n  up there  there s got to be a real straw and camel feel to the
whole thing  
the door swings all the way open and clunks against the wall behind it  michael pemulis has pretended to kick it in   good lard preserve us he s
nekkid   he says  coming in and closing the door to check behind it  hal holds up a hand for him to wait a second 
 except here s the thing   orin says  pemulis stands expectantly in an uncluttered patch of hal s half of the floor and makes a show of looking at
his wrist as if there were a watch there  hal nods at him and holds up one finger 
 except here s the thing   orin is saying   the issue she raises is is there really any sort of realistic hope of quebec getting gentle to get o n a n 
to reverse the reconfiguration  take back the concavity  shut down the fans  make us acknowledge the waste as fundamentally american waste  
 well probably of course not   hal looks up at pemulis and makes his own hand into a claw and makes clawing motions at the phone  pemulis is
compulsively going around zipping and unzipping everything in the room with a zipper  a habit of his hal loathes   but now she s got you falling
back into demanding realistic and consistent logic from fringe mentalities again  
 but hallie just hang on  canada as a whole couldn t oppose o n a n  wouldn t  ottawa s so far in now they wouldn t say shit if they had three
times the mouthful they already have  of shit i mean  
pemulis is pointing vehemently out the west window at the parking lot where the tow truck is parked and making exaggerated henry vlll like
rending and chewing motions  his eyes  under the waning influence of p m  stimulants  do not get mirthful or glazed 
they just get tiny and lightless and even closer together in his narrow face  like a second set of nostrils  the right eye s little wobble is out of
sync with the pulse of his earring 
there s the sound of orin switching phone hands   so then i ll ask you what she seemed like she rhetorically asked  are the separatists  and
fringe cells  pathetic little anti o n a n  campaigns and gestures down here basically just hopeless and pathetic  

  does fish shit drift slowly bottomward  o   how could she see it as anything but  if she s as savvy as you say   hal removes his pruned white
foot from the janitor bucket and dries it on a woppsed up sheet  he points at a pair of underwear near pemulis s dock sider  pemulis picks the
briefs up off the floor with two fingers and tosses them to hal with a pretend shudder 
 so simply largely symbolic at best  then  
hal s lying back trying to get his legs into the briefs with one hand   tell her after much chin stroking simply yes  o  o   pemulis is standing here
already in his hat pretending to clang a dinner bell  he s got big glittery ropes of drool swinging from his lower lip   pemulis is actually making a
complex system of motions indicating both the procedures for rolling a dubois and the lateness of the hour  for the past two years  hal and
pemulis and struck and troeltsch and sometimes b  boone have made a little ritual of nipping out to the little hidden clearing behind west house s
parking lot s dumpsters and sharing an obscene cigar sized dubois before the i  day eve expedition and supper out  while schacht and sometimes
ortho stice sit inside the tow truck  faces green in the green glow of the truck s instruments  warming it up  hal sits up and makes a waggling goon ahead on down motion to pemulis 
 but you have the      mr  hope   pemulis stage whispers 
 one moment please   hal clamps a hand hard over the phone and covers phone and hand with two pillows and some bedding  and stagewhispers  where s your part of the mr  h  all of a sudden  why do we have to roll a zeppelin out of my part of the hope i bought retail from you
not three days ago  
the nystagmus makes the eye rolling lurider   extenuations  we can get it all sorted out right later  nobody s going to like exploit you  
and then it s hard to extract the hand and phone   o   i m going to have to book out of here in just about one second  
 just how about this  ponder this in advance for me and try and stay upright til you can call me back  this was the subject s crux type proposal 
you can call collect if you want  
 i don t have to respond   hal says 
 correct  
 i just listen and then break the connection  
 calling me like tonight or tomorrow before lunch  collect if i  day s full toll  
 i just sit here very briefly and then the conversation s over and we can go   hal s directing all this more at pemulis  who s pacing and holding the
constantine bust in his hands and examining it at close range  shaking his head 
 all set  this is it  are you set  
 so go already  
 her poser goes roughly like this  if the separatists  big object has always been to independently secede  and if they ve got about a snowball s
chance of ever really getting o n a n  de reconfigured  and if pretty much all canadians despise gentle and the transfer of the concavity and the
whole experialist merde sandwich  but especially the concavity  the cartographic fact of a concavity in our map and a new convexity in theirs  that
the maps now say it s canadian soil  this toxified like area  grant that all this is obviously right  then why don t the separatists in quebec use the
fact of the odiousness of the concavity to go put their parliamentary wigs on and go to ottawa to parliament and say to the rest of canada like 
look  let us secede  and we ll take the concavity with us when we secede  it ll be our problem not yours  it ll go on the maps as quebecois and not
canadian  it ll be our blot and our bone of dissension with o n a n   and canadian honor will be desmirched  and canada s pathetic standing in
o n a n  and the like world community of standings will be rehabilitated because of the ingenious way ottawa s parliament will have regerrymandered o n a n  s map without taking on the u s  directly  why not this  why don t they go to ottawa and say cuibono all around and say
this way everybody wins  we get our own notre rai pays  and you get the slap in the face of the concavity off your map  the subject posited why
the nucks don t see the odiousness of the concavity as maybe the best thing that ever happened to them in terms of canada s persuadability into
letting quebec go  she hit me with why wouldn t your thinking militant nucks use the concavity as a bargaining chip for independence  why would
they want o n a n  to take back the one thing odious enough to be a chip  
 who s this you re talking to you can t call back   pemulis says loudly  pacing back and forth with little toy soldier about faces  his hoop flickering
like mad 
hal lowers the phone but doesn t cover it   it s orin  wanting to know why quebec and the f l q  and so on haven t tried bargaining with the
canadian administration  offering quebec s cartographic adoption of the concavity in exchange for separation   hal cocks his head slightly   this
could be poutrincourt s so called separation and return s real meaning  it occurs to me  
 orin as in your brother  with the leg  
 he s all in a swivet about inter o n a n ite politics  
pemulis makes a megaphone of his hands   tell him who gives a bright flaming fart  tell him to go read a book  tell him to access any one of a
dozen d bases off of the net  tell him you re pretty sure he can afford it   pemulis s hands are slender and red knuckled and his fingers long and
sort of falcate   tell him you can hear the truck getting impatiently revved as on one of the very few totally free nights we ever get our friends get
ready to leave without you  remind him how we have to eat on schedule up here or we get the wobbles  tell him we read books and tirelessly
access d bases and run our asses off all day here and need to eat instead of we don t just stand there and swing one leg up and down over and
over for seven plus figures  
 tell penisless to go sit on something sharp   orin says 
 o   he s right  i can feel that feeling of my body starting to feed on itself  you said i could think and call you back  i ll use your pager if you like  
pemulis has used one foot to clear a path through laundry and diskettes and books and gear to the west window  where he s making broad
involved gestures with a person or persons outside down on the grounds whom the window s big sill keeps hal from being able to see  hal s
underwear is at a diagonal across his pelvis  orin on the phone is saying 
 picture this and see what you think  imagine this  the f l q  and other various separatist cells all suddenly divert their terror s energies away
from canada and suddenly start mounting an insurgent campaign of u s  and mexican harassment  but the thing is they make a big deal of
terroristically insurging against o n a n  on the behalf of all of canada  they even find a way to bring the albertan ultra rightists in on it  plus other
provincial fringes  so it looks to o n a n  like maybe all of canada as a whole is in on the insurging  
 i don t have to picture it  it s what s going on  the c p c p   makes incursions against montana like clockwork  there was that horrific jamming
of interlace pulses and substitution of porn films for children s programming around duluth in june traced to that psycho quintet in southwest
ontario  the interstates north of saratoga are still supposed to be undrivable after sunset  
 exactly  
 so some point for me to ponder needs to emerge really fast  here  orin  
 the point is i was rhetorically invited by the subject to entertain the picture of it all really being the nucks  the pan canadian thing being a
dodge  the separatists all somehow united and orchestrating the anti o n a n ism  the rhetorical question becomes to imagine this and ask  why
would they do this  
 we re wearing a groove in the same track again  o  it s because the concavity impacts mainly quebec  
 no  i mean she meant why would they make such a noise about insurging on behalf of all of canada and go to such lengths to orchestrate the
appearance of pan canadian anti o n a n ism  
 and then judging by precedent the subject gave a hypothetical answer to her own question  have you gotten to get a word in edgewise
throughout this series of interviews  o   
 what if it s that the nuck separatists know totally well that if the o n a n  administration sees canada as a big enough roach in the ointment 
gentle and unspecified services  boys in white can get together with mexico s vichified puppet state and make things like really unpleasant indeed
for ottawa  they could make canada the sort of black scapegoat of all of o n a n  there s little you can picture that might be worse than being the

 one country in a three country continental anschluss that the other two countries are ganging up on and making things unpleasant for  
 vichified anschluss  this doesn t sound like any orin i know  these are rabidly political catchwords  what kind of heartbreaking rubensian
moment type fluff journalist is this you re so determined to    
 the unpleasantness is pretty easy to imagine a picture of  the e w d  vectors could easily be recalibrated further north  gentle could tell them 
our waste resources are extensive  at the mildest  he could say  good sized chunks of canada could be concav itized  
 i have to go  pemulis is slumped back against the wall with his hands over his stomach and is slumping all the way down the wall looking
wobbly and pale  
 ponder the picture of the parliament s nails bitten all the way down to the ragged pink pulpy stuff as the nucks orchestrate the terrorism so it
looks more and more like canada versus o n a n  
hal s in slacks and one street sock and one athletic sock and picking different shirts up off the floor  trying to smell a clean one   but this is all   
 kyaaaa   pemulis vaults a corner of hal s bed and tries to claw at the transparent phone s antenna like he s going to break it off  hal turns to
protect the phone with a shoulder  whipping at pemulis with a sweatshirt 
orin is saying  what i m asking is for you to ponder could it maybe end up that quebec  after wreaking various mayhi down here and making it
look like it s all of canada  the p q s or somebody respectable gets wigged up and go to ottawa and offers this deal  parliament gets the p m  and
the government to get the other provinces to let quebec go  separate  aller  partir   and in return quebec ll step up the anti o n a n  harassment
and insurgency while dropping the pretense of other provinces being involved and all of canada insurging and make it publicly clear that it s
quebec and quebec alone that s o n a n  s real nemesis  they tell ottawa they ll offer the contiguousness of the concavity as their reason and
send absolutely everything they ve got in terms of terrorism at o n a n  and gentle  taking full credit each time  offering themselves as the culprit
and de reconfiguration as the objective  
 so your multilevelled journalist s hypothesizing a kind of meta extortion   hal can hear pemulis s whistle lipped breathing   separation is still the
quebecer insurgents  real goal  and their anti o n a n  insurgency is not what it appears   hal s in the dark under the desk that the fold out tp and
drives and phone console and modem are stacked on one corner of  surrounded by nests of wires  trying to find his other street shoe   it s
supposedly just been a ruse to arouse o n a n  s ire at canada so the quebecers can use the u s  and mexico as levers on ottawa  
 trying to engineer it so that canada ll be more than happy to disassociate from them  
orin says   and fm saying i don t have the background or lobes to even know whether she might be putting me on  testing my depth  
 you ve always had a special dread of depth testing  
 how about why don t you just toss me the bob and axhandle and me ll go down and get things ready and wait for you   pemulis stage whispers
to hal s slacks  bottom  which is pretty much all that s visible from under the desk  hal s hand comes up out of the leg space under the desk and
raises one finger and shakes it a little for emphasis  pemulis is standing next to the small tp viewer   which is propped up like a large photo with a
buttressy thing that folds out of its back   and the tp s disk  and cartridge drive  which takes up less than a quarter of the desktop and has the
phone s console and power unit bolted into a receptacle on the drive s side 
hal s voice is muffled and has the strained pitch of someone trying to clear nests of dust bunnied wire to find something   except orin i don t see
a great deal of pondering required here  the total anti u s  insurgency so far s been too hapless and small potato for her theory to work  the odd
pie  and guano bombardment  stretching mirrors across lonely roads  even demapping officials and botulizing the occasional peanut jar  none of
this is exactly bringing anyone to his knees  none of this is making canada or quebec look like any kind of serious threat  
michael pemulis  his jaunty cap pushed back and his lips pursed as if whistling  but not whistling  is very casually brushing his hand over the
drive and console s power unit  as if killing time by casually dusting  his other hand s jingling pocket change  there s the sound of hal clunking his
head on something under the desk  his bottom is bony and his belt has missed two loops  the power unit s toggle s next to a little red jewel of a
power light that blinks at the same rate as a smoke alarm when the toggle s on on 
hal sneezes twice  pemulis taps his fingers in a little anapestic gallop over the unit s top  orin sounds like he s sitting up straight   hallie kid now
you re right with me  this is where your pondering lobes come in  because that was just my response  that there was nothing sufficiently more than
just an annoying gnat like annoyance about the insurgencies  which is where she moved beyond my depth back into l a   if you remember  when

pemulis here  dictating to inc  who can just sit there making a steeple out of his fingers and pressing it to his lip and not take notes and wait
and like inscribe  sic  it anytime in the next week and get it verbatim  the smug turd  using the mean value formula for dividing available
megatonnage among combatants whose gnp military    military nuke ratios vary from eschaton to eschaton keeps you from needing to crunch out
a new ratio for each combatant each time  plus lets you multi regress the results so combatants get rewarded for past thermonuclear largesse
 occasional verbal flourishes hal s   hji   the formula s also provable by the extreme value theorem  which the ev theorem itself has a proof
that s just about the biggest unit twisting bitch in the whole of applied differentiation  but i see hal grimacing  so we ll keep it compact  even
though this whole thing is real interesting if you re interested and whatnot 
say you ve got a combatant and a record of his past gnp military    military nuke ratios  we want to give the combatant the like exact average
of all the past megatonnages he s gotten in the past  the exact average is called the  mean value   which ought to give us a bit of a giggle  given
the hostility of the context here 
so then but let a stand for the mean value of a combatant s constantly fluctuating ratio and so constantly fluctuating initial megatonnage  we
want to find a and give the combatant exactly a megatons  how to do it s pretty elegant  and all you need for it is two pieces of data  the most his
ratio s ever been and the least it s ever been  these two datums  sic  are called the extreme values of the cn n function for which a s the mean
value  by the way 
so then but so let   be a continuous non negative function  meaning the ratio  on the interval  a  b   meaning the difference between the least
the ratio s ever been and the most it s ever been and whatnot   are these little explanations aggravating  sic   inc s looking at me like butter would
freeze  it s hard to know what to assume v  what to explain  i m trying to be as clear as i can be  sic   and now he s looking at me like i m
digressing  why don t you just pass that certain item back on over here  inculator  but so we ve got   and we ve got  a  bj  and let r and r be the
smallest and biggest values of the function   x  on the interval  a  b   so now check out the rectangles of height r and height r over the interval  a 
b  in the diagram marked let s go ahead and mark it say peemster 

peemster

the mean value we re after  a  can now be expressed integrally as the area of some intermediate type rectangle whose height is taller  sic  than
r but shorter  sic  than r  from here on it s just tit  we need a constant  you always need a constant  inc s nodding his head sarcastically like i
think i m saying something sage  let d be any constant  for computational reasons the closer to   the better  so like let d be the size of hal s unit 
hal incandenza s addendum  in meters 
michael pemulis s resumption  very funny  so now  just looking at the wicked illuminating peemster diagram above  you can see that this area
we want 
is going to be bigger than the area of the rectangle with height r and but also smaller than the area of the rectangle with height r  pure mental
reason  sic  compels  then  that  sic  somewhere in there between r and r there s an exact height  f x    such that  i have to say that every
demonstration of a stats theorem has let and such that in them  mostly i think because they re so wicked much fun to say  such that the rectangle
of this height f x   over the whole interval  a  b  has exactly the area we want  the mean value of all the historic  sic  expenditure ratios  in other
words in abstracted form 

where  b   a  is just the size of the interval  and so have a look at the revealing diagram labeled halsadick 

this fucking works  you don t have to crunch out a whole new ratio each time for each combatant to dole out the ordnance  you just skim the
highest and lowest ratios off the eschaton records the beanie man keeps on each time  this is wicked  this is fucking elegant  note that  note
that s another like compulsitory  sic  term  note that the combatant s mean value megatonnage will change  slightly  from eschaton to eschaton 
exactly the way a like hitter s season average will alter just a bit from at bat to at bat  depending integrally on what he delivered on his last trip to

 the plate and whatnot  note also that you can use this mean value time saver with anything that varies within a  definable  set of boundaries and
whatnot   like any line  or a tennis court s boundaries  or like maybe say a certain drug s urine level range between clean and royally pinched  as
a like exercise  if you re interested  play three hours of high level competitive jr  top level  sic  tennis and then calculate the mean value of the
ratios of first serves to appearances at net and appearances at net to points won  for a serve and volleyer  this is how to tell how serve dependent

thinks he s just too sly trying to outline eschaton in the  rd person tense  sic  like some jowly old

transcript fragment from interview series for putative
moment magazine soft profile on phoenix cardinal
professional punter o  j  incandenza  by putative moment
magazine soft profile writer helen steeply    november y d a u   q  
 well  there are odd sorts of consolations in having somebody go progressively bats in front of your eyes  such as for example sometimes the
mad stork would go off on things in sort of a funny way  we always thought he was funny a good bit of the time 
 you ve got to remember he came at entertainment more from an interest in lenses and light  most arty directors i think get more abstract as
they go on  with him it was the opposite  a lot of his funniest stuff was very abstract  are those earrings real copper  can you wear real copper  
 q  
 you ve got to remember that he came out of all these old artish directors that were really  ne pas a la mode  anymore by the time he broke in 
not just lang and bresson and deren but the anti new wave abstracters like frampton  wacko nucks like godbout  anticonfluential directors like
dick and the snows who not only really belonged in a quiet pink room somewhere but were also self consciously behind the times  making all sorts

 of heavy art gesture films about film and consciousness and isness and diffraction and stasis et cetera  most extremely beautiful women pve ever
met complain of getting a sort of itchy green crust when they wear real copper  so the tenure jockeys and critics who were hailing this millennial
new orthochromatic neorealism thing as the real new avant garde thing were getting tenure by blasting dick and godbout and the flying snow
brothers and the stork for trying to be avant garde  when really they were self consciously trying to be more like apres garde  i never did get
straight on what orthochromatic means  but it was very trendy  but the mad stork talked a lot about intentional atavism and retrogradism and
stasis  plus the academics who hated him hated the artificial sets and the chiaroscuro lighting  which the stork had a total fetish for weird lenses
and chiaroscuro 
 after the thing about the medusa and the odalisque came out  and the joke  and the film establishment theory queers were holding their noses
and saying incandenza s still mired in this late century self referencing unentertaining formalism and unrealistic abstraction  after a while himself 
the stork  in his own progressively bats way  decided to get revenge  he planned a lot of it out at mclean hospital  which s out in belmont  which
is where himself had almost his own private reserved room  by then  he made up a genre that he considered the ultimate neorealism and got
some film journals to run some proc lamatory edictish things he wrote about it  and he got duquette at m i t  and a couple other younger tenurejockeys who were in on it to start referring and writing little articles in journals and quarterlies about it and talking at art openings and avant garde
theater and film openings  feeding it into the grapevine  hailing some new movement they called found drama  this supposedly ultimate
neorealism thing that they all declared was like the future of drama and cinematic art  etc 
 because i m thinking if you like copper stuff and little aztec suns there s a small place down in tempe where i know the owner and he has some
incredible little copper pieces we could parp down and have you look at  my own theory is it takes an incredible natural complexion to be able to
wear the baser metals  though it might just be an allergy thing  the way some women react and some don t  
 q  
 what found drama was   and you ve got to keep in mind that duquette and a brandeis critic named like posener who was in on the revenge
each got a mammoth grant for this  and the mad stork got two smaller ones somewhere  grants  to go cross country to graduate film programs
giving turgid theoretical deadly serious lectures on this found drama  and then they d come back up home to boston and the stork and the couple
critics would lay up drunk and invent new found drama theoretical lectures and chortle and laugh till there was evidence it was time for himself to
go back to detox again  
 q  
 like a family nickname  hal and i either called him himself or the sad stork  the moms was the first to say himself  which i think is a canadian
thing  hal mostly said himself  god knows what mario used to call him  who knows  i said mad  the mad stork  
 q  
 no see there weren t any real cartridges or pieces of found drama  this was the joke  all it was was you and a couple cronies like leith or
duquette got out a metro boston phone book and tore a white pages page out at random and thumbtacked it to the wall and then the stork
would throw a dart at it from across the room  at the page  and the name it hit becomes the subject of the found drama  and whatever happens
to the protagonist with the name you hit with the dart for like the next hour and a half is the drama  and when the hour and a half is up  you go
out and have drinks with critics who like chortlingly congratulate you on the ultimate in neorealism  
 q  
 you do whatever you want during the drama  you re not there  nobody knows what the name in the phone book s doing  
 q  
 the joke s theory was there s no audience and no director and no stage or set because  the mad stork and his cronies argued  in reality there
are none of these things  and the protagonist doesn t know he s the protagonist in a found drama because in reality nobody thinks they re in any
sort of drama  
 q  
 almost nobody  that s a very good point  almost nobody  i m going to take a chance and just tell you i m a little bit intimidated here  
 q  
 i m worried this might sound sexist or offensive  i ve been around very  very beautiful women before  but i m not accustomed to them being
really acute and sharp and politically savvy and penetrating and multilevelled and intimidatingly intelligent  i m sorry if that sounds sexist  it s
simply been my experience  i ll go ahead and simply tell you the truth and take the chance that you might think i m some kind of stereotypical
neanderthal athlete or sexist clown  
 q  
 absolutely no  no  nothing got recorded or filmed  reality being camera free  being the joke i ll again underline  nobody even knew what the guy
in the phone book had been doing  nobody knew what the drama had been  although they liked to speculate when they d go out after the time
was up to have drinks and pretend to review how the drama went  himself usually imagined the guy was sitting there watching cartridges  or
counting some pattern in his wallpaper  or looking out the window  it wasn t impossible maybe even the name you hit with the dart was somebody
dead in the last year and the phone book hadn t caught up  and here was this guy who was dead and just a random name in a phone book and the
subject of what people for a few months   until himself couldn t keep a straight face anymore or had had enough revenge on the critics  because
the critics were hailing   not just the critics in on the joke  but actual tenure jockeys who were getting tenure to assess and dismiss and hail  
they were hailing this as the ultimate in avant garde neorealism  and saying maybe the stork deserved reappraisal  for a drama with no audience
and oblivious actors who might have moved away or died  a certain mad stork got two grants out of it and later made a lot of enemies because he
refused to give them back after the hoax was like unveiled  the whole thing was kind of bats  he spread the grant money for found drama around
a couple of local improvisation companies  it s not like he kept the money  it s not like he needed it  i think he especially liked the idea that the star
of the show might have already moved away or recently died and there was no way to know

the festivity here being due largely to the fact that both he and gerhardt schtitt returned from putting on little e t a  presentations at various
tennis clubs too late to have been informed about the degenerative eschaton free for all and serious lord   ingersoll   and penn injuries  both
trainer barry loach and prorector rik dunkel having told avril  and schtitt to be told by whichever of nwangi and delint first works up the pluck 
and the issue of telling tavis being as would be s o p  left up to avril  who will   because tavis has already lost a certain amount of sleep
preparing emotionally and rhetorically for the impending arrival of putative moment journalist  helen  steeply  whom he s been convinced to let onto
the grounds by avril s argument that the moment office promises the profile s subject and inevitable hype involve only an e t a  alumnus  avril
neglected to tell tavis she was pretty sure it was orin  and that a certain amount of soft news publicity for e t a  qua institution couldn t hurt in
either the fundraising  or the recruiting goodwill department   who will almost certainly wait and tell tavis  who s in far too festive a mood to
notice three or four younger kids ominously absent from the supper and gala  in the morning  if the poor man s to have a chance at any real sleep
at all  also giving avril time to figure out how upperclass heads can roll  as of course they must  given chaos and season ending injuries under the
direct gaze of designated big buddies  without those heads including that of hal  who   unlike  thank god  john   was identified at the scene with
that pemulis person   hal can tell just by the dining hall s emotional gestalt that neither schtitt nor tavis knows about the eschaton  but the moms
is next to impossible to read  and hal won t know whether she s been told of the debacle until he is able to pry mario away from anton  the

mario s speculative puppet show comes down maybe a little hard on the implication that former o c d  support group sponsor and later clean
u s  party campaign manager and now o u s  chief rodney p  tine is the real dark force behind reconfiguration and new england s de mapping
and the transfer of the great concavity  that johnny gentle  famous crooner was and remains a slightly unbent but basically genial and befuddled
figurehead  content mostly to twirl his mike and immolate his epidermis so long as his office is clean and his food s pre tasted  and that it s actually
been tine behind c u s p  s geopolitical anality and experialism  and that tine was essentially pulling gentle s strings all through the concavity
cabinet and subsequent reconfiguration and mass relocation  this is  in point of fact  simply one theory and direction for finger pointing  and tends
to founder on the unexplained issue of just what would motivate tine to undertake all this anyway  since his own o c d  has been documented to
be ruminative rather than hygienic  not to mention the fact that he s hopelessly smitten with the quebecer luria p        j  o  incandenza s own
onantiad  being an adult production  was considerably more restrained and ambiguous on the whole tine as dark force issue

of such terms as america  decadence  state  or law  but mario i  was pretty much the only one clued in to the fact that schtitt s attraction to
gentle had more to do with schtitt s take on tennis than anything else  the coach was swept away with the athleto wagnerian implications of
gentle s proposals for waste  this business of sending from yourself what you hope will not return

it s also where mario s most derivative of himself  whose own onantiad was more centrally concerned with doomed high office claymation
romance than with political comment  though the love thing in incandenza sr  s film had concerned not tine and a quebecois fatale but an alleged
doomed and unconsummated affair between president j  gentle and the equally hygiene and germ obsessed wife of canada s  minister of environment and resource development enterprises   the affair presented as doomed and unconsummated because the minister hires a malevolent young
canadian candida albicans specialist to induce in his wife a severe and more or less permanent yeast infection  driving both wife and gentle to
ardent desire v  hygienic neurosis breakdowns during which the wife throws herself across the tracks in front of a quebecois bullet train and gentle
decides to exact his revenge on a macrocartographic scale  the onantiad was not him self s strongest effort by a long shot  and pretty much

e g   ted schacht adjusting his wristbands and sash  carol spodek stretching for a volley at net  her whole body distended  face grim and full of
cords  an old one of marlon bain at the follow through of a big forehand  a corona of sweat shimmering around him  his bigger arm crossed across
his throat  ortho stice doing a handstand  yardguard gliding down through a low backhand  wayne this summer sliding on rome s fine clay  a red

gets a little ahead of herself on a backhand  on and on  they re not in a straight line  they re more like chaotically placed  heath pearson  former
tow truck shareholder  now at pepperdine  facing away from the camera  under lung light  running  the palmer academy courts looking cheesy in
the heat  a lot of the photos are stills from mario  peter beak falling nastily after a stretch volley  both feet off what looks like longwood s synthetic
grass  the photos surrounded by locationless clouds and sky  freer in the bleachers at brisbane in thongs and a tank top  giving the camera a
peace sign  the lung in mid assembly with pearson and penn and vandervoort and mackey and the rest of that year s seniors out in the pavilion s
webbed chairs  feet up in the cold  kibbitzing hal and schacht and the other kids lugging parts  one of mrs  clarke s cooks in a hairnet mixing
something with an arm sized pestle in a bowl she has to tilt to hold  none of mario or orin  a battalion of kids in sweats doing sprints up the hill in
deep snow  two or three well behind and ominously bent over  some lighter blue rectangles where pictures have been taken down and not yet
replaced  a shirtless freer playing microtennis with lori clow  a close up of bespectacled gretchen holt staring in disbelief at a linesman s call 
wayne and a manitoban in t shirts with leaves on them  hands over their hearts  facing north  kent blott with a horrified boomerang mouth and his
nose a protrusion in the supporter fit over his ears and nose and traub and lord collapsing around him in either hilarity or horror  hal and wayne
at the net in doubles  both leaning way over left like the whole court s tilted 
   
hal and mario have long since had to accepta the fact that avril  at      is still endocrinologically compelling to males 
a   accept  isn t the same as  be crazy about   of course 
   
as with the neuro gastric thing  only ted schacht and hal know that pemulis s deepest dread is of academic or disciplinary expulsion and
ejection  of having to schlepp back down comm  ave  into blue collar allston diploma  and ticket outless  and now in his final e t a  year the
dread s increased many fold  and is one reason pemulis takes such elaborate precautions in all extracurriculars   making a substance customer
explicitly suborn him  etc    and is why hal and schacht presented him on his last birthday with the poster over pemulis s room s console that has
a careworn large crowned king sitting on his throne stroking his chin and brooding  with the caption  yes  i m paranoid   but am i paranoid

enough 
   

though it s unmentioned  everyone in the waiting room except ann kittenplan is keenly aware that lord and postal weight are pemulis s
charges  penn and ingersoll ax handle s  plus that neither struck nor troeltsch seems to have been summoned for potential discipline 
   
since tennis courts are laid side to side and played on by hard hitting but fallible humans  errant shots are always going off sticks  frames and
net posts and even fences and bouncing and rolling into other people s territory  in starting at usually the quarterfinal rounds of serious
tournaments there are ballboys to retrieve them  in early rounds and practice  though  the delicate etiquette is that you suspend play and get other
people s balls for them  if they come rolling across  and shoot them back over to the court of origin  the way to signal for this sort of help is to yell
 sorry   or  a little help on three   or something  but both hal and axford seem constitutionally incapable of doing this  asking for help with errant
balls  they both have to hold everything and go and run all the way over to some other court  halting at each intervening court to wait for a point
to be finished  to get their own balls  it s a curious inability to request aid that no amount of negative reinforcement from tex watson or aubrey
delint can seem to correct 
   
where it s a non overhead run back to the baseline after an offensive lob then run all   the   way   back   up   and   tap   the   netcord   with your   stick   j ust   as   nwangi   or   thode hits another offensive lob over your head you have to run back and get successfully back or theypile extra lobs onto your regular allotment pure pain fest 
   
a clipperton level legend involves the now long gone little e t a  who in y w  q m d  had called ma s department of social services and
characterized disciplinary pukers as child abuse  resulting in the appearance at the portcullis of two stitchy mouthed and humorless d s s  ladies
who hung creepily around all day and required schtitt s actually confining aubrey delint to his room  so purply furious was delint with the kid
who d dropped the dime

hal had missed out on the soft grass  clay  and har tru surfaces of the jr  slams  because a singular disadvantage of attending a north

transcript fragments from interview series for putative moment magazine soft profile on phoenix
cardinal professional punter o  j  incandenza  by putative moment magazine soft profile writer
helen steeply  november y d a u 
 i m not going to talk about why i don t talk to the moms anymore    q    or the mad stork s adventures in the mental health community  either  
 q  
 we re not off to a good start here  ma am  no matter how lovely you re looking in that pantsuit  
 q  
 because the question doesn t mean anything is why  insane is just like a catch term  it doesn t describe anything  it isn t a reason for anything 
the stork was a full blown demented alcoholic for the last three years of his life  and he put his head in the microwave  and i think just in terms of
unpleasantness you d have to be sort of insane to kill yourself in such a painful way  so but was he insane  in the last five years of his life he put
together a tennis academy and got together a national caliber coaching staff and u s t a  accreditation and sanction and multi grid funding and set
up the start of an endowment for e t a   and also came up with that new kind of window glass that doesn t fog or smudge from people touching it
or breathing on it and drawing little finger oil faces on it  then sold it to mitsubishi  and also managed the revenues from all his previous patents 
plus of course drank himself blind on a daily basis and then needed at least two hours to sit there naked under a scratchy blanket and shake  and
went around impersonating various kinds of health care professionals during the periods he believed he was a health care professional  from when
he had the delirium tremen type career delusions  and in his spare time made in depth documentaries and a dozen art films that people are still
writing doctoral theses on  so was he insane  it s true  the new yorker guy  the film guy who replaced the guy who replaced rafferty  what was
his name  it s true he kept saying the films were like the planet s most psychotic psyche working out its shit right there on the screen and asking
you to pay to watch him  but you have to remember that that guy got third degree burned by the whole found drama scam  that guy was one of
the high caliber critics who said in print that here incandenza had put drama ahead three or four leaps in one visionary leap  and after the stork
finally couldn t keep a straight face anymore and spilled the beans on npr radio during a  fresh air  dramaturgy panel the new yorker guy dropped
from critical sight for like a year and then when he came back he had it in for himself in a very big way  which is understandable  
 q  
 what i started to say is if quote unquote sources you cannot name say the reason i m not in contact is i claim the moms is insane  well  what is
insane supposed to mean  do i trust her i do not  do i want to be in association with her in any way   that is a neg  do i think she s irretrievably
bats  one of her best friends is the e t a  counselor  rusk  with doctorates in both gender and deviance  does she think the moms is bats  
 q  
 the criteria i was analogizing to the stork is does the moms function  and the moms functions and then some  the moms careers through the
day turboed and in fifth gear  you ve got the assorted deaning at e t a  you ve got the full teaching load there  you ve got accreditation reports
and structuring both quadrivium and trivium three years ahead of time at the start of every year  you ve got writing prescriptive linguistics books
that come out every thirty six months so you could set your watch by them  you ve got grammatical conferences and conventions  which she
doesn t leave the grounds ever anymore but she s there videophonically rain or shine for them all  you ve got the militant grammarians of
massachusetts  which she co founded with a couple quote cherished academic friends  also bats  where the m g m s for instance go around to
mass  supermarkets and dun the manager if the express checkout sign says    items or less instead of or fewer and so on  the year before
the mad stork s death the orange crush people had an ad on billboards and little magazine fall out cards that said crush  with a taste that s
all it s o wn  with like a possessive  t  and i swear the m g m  squad lost their minds  the moms spent five weeks going back and forth to nny
city  organized two different rallies on madison avenue that got very ugly  acted as her own attorney in the suit the crush people brought  never
slept  never once slept  lived on cigarettes and salad  huge salads always consumed very late at night  the moms has a thing about never eating

 until it s late  
 q  
 apparently it s the noise  she can t take urban noise  she says  is why hallie says she hasn t set glass slipper one off the grounds in   you d
have to ask hallie  the volvo was already up on blocks when i was at college downtown  but i know she went to the stork s funeral  which was off
the grounds  now she s got a tri modem and videophony out the bazoo  though she d never use a tableau  i know  
 q  
 well it s been pretty obvious since early on out in weston the moms has o c d  obsessive compulsive disorder  the only reason she s never
been diagnosed or treated for it is that in her the disorder doesn t prevent her from functioning  it all seems to come back to functioning 
traversion is character  according to schtitt  one guy i was close to at e t a  for years developed the kind of impairing o c d  where you need
treatment   bain wasted huge amounts of time on all these countless rituals of washing  cleaning  checking things  walking  had to have a tsquare on the court to make sure all the strings on his stick were intersecting at      could only go through a doorway if he d felt all around the
frame of the doorway by hand  checking the frame for god knows what  and then was totally unable to trust his senses and always had to recheck
the doorway he d just checked  we had to physically carry bain out of the locker room  before tournaments  actually we ve been close all our lives 
notwithstanding that marlon bain is the single sweatiest human being you d ever want to get within a click of  i think the o c d  might have started
as a result of the compulsive sweat  which the sweat itself started after his parents were killed in a grotesque freak accident  bain s  unless the
strain of the constant rituals and fussing itself exaculates the perspiring  the stork used marlon in death in scarsdale  if you want to see way more
than you want to know about perspiration  but the e t a  staff indulged bain s pathology about doorways because schtitt s own mentor had been
pathologically devoted to this idea that you are what you walk between  it s so nice to be able to end a sentence with a preposition when it s
easier  jesus i m thinking usage again  this is why i avoid the topic of the moms  the whole topic starts to infect me  it takes me days to clean
myself out of it  traversion being character according to schtitt  it takes a certain type of woman to look that good in a pantsuit  i think  i ve
always   
 q  
 i think the point being that with actual clinical obsessive compulsive disorder i had to watch much of my ex doubles partner s life grind to a
halt because it d take him three hours to shower and then another two to get out through the shower door  he was in this sort of paralysis of
compulsive motions that didn t serve any kind of function  the moms  on the other hand  can function with the compulsions because she s also
compulsively efficient and practical about her compulsions  whether this makes her more insane than marlon bain or less insane than marlon bain 
who can like say  as an instance the moms solved a lot of her threshold problems by having no real doors or doorways built on the first floor of
hmh so the rooms are all split off by angles and partitions and plants  the moms kept to a prussian bathroom schedule so she couldn t spend
hours in there washing her hands until the skin fell off the way bain s did  he had to wear cotton gloves the whole summer right before he left
e t a  the moms for a while had video cameras installed so she could obsessively check whether mrs  clarke d left the oven on or check her plants 
arrangement or whether all the bathroom towels are lined up with their fringes flush without physically checking  she had a little wall of monitors in
her study at hmh  the stork put up with the cameras but the sense i get is that tavis isn t going to be keen on being photorecorded in the
bathroom or anyplace else  so maybe she s had to have other recourse   you can check that yourself out there  what i m trying to say is she s compulsively efficient even about her obsessions and compulsions  of course there are doors upstairs  lockable doors  but that s in service of other
compulsions  the moms s  you can go ahead and ask her what i mean  she s so compulsive she s got the compulsions themselves arranged so
efficiently that she can get everything done and still have plenty of time left over for her children  these are a constant drain on her batteries  she s
got to keep hal s skull lashed tight to hers without being so overt about it that hallie has any idea what s going on  to keep him from trying to pull
his skull away  the kid s still obsessed with her approval  he lives for applause from exactly two hands  he s still performing for her  syntax  and
vocabulary wise  at seventeen  the same way he did when he was ten  the kid is so shut down talking to him is like throwing a stone in a pond 
the kid has no idea he even knows something s wrong  plus the moms has to obsess over mario and mario s various challenges and tribulations and
little patheticnesses and worship mario and think mario s some kind of secular martyr to the mess she d made of her adult life  all the while having
to keep up a front of laissez faire laid back management where she pretends to let mario go his own way and do his own thing  
 q  
 i m not going to talk about it  
 q  
 no and don t insult my intelligence  i m not going to talk about why i don t want to talk about it  if this is going to be a moment article  hallie s
going to read it  and then he ll read it to booboo  and i m not talking about the stork s death or the moms s stability in a thing where they ll read
about it and have to read some authoritative report on my take on it instead of coming to their own terms about it  with it  rather  terms with 
terms about  no  terms with it  
     
 they both might have to wait until they get away from there before they can even realize what s going on  that the moms is unredeemably
fucking bats  all these terms that became cliches   denial  schizogenic  pathogenic family like systems and so on and so forth  a former
acquaintance said the mad stork always used to say cliches earned their status as cliches because they were so obviously true  
     
 i never once saw the two of them fight  not once in eighteen domestic and academy years  is all i ll say    q  
 the late stork was the victim of the most monstrous practical joke ever played  in my opinion  is all i ll say  
 all right  i ll relate one antidoteb that might be more revealing of the moms s emotional weather than any adjective  jesus  see  i start explicitly
referring to parts of speech just thinking about the whole thing  the thing about people who are truly and malignantly crazy  their real genius is for
making the people around them think they themselves are crazy  in military science this is called psy ops  for your info  
 q  
 i m sorry  right then  one illustrative thing  which thing to pick  embarrassment of riches  i ll pick one at random  i think i was maybe twelve  i
was in    s  i know  on that summer s tour  though i was playing    s when i was still ten  it was ten to thirteen that i was regarded as gifted 
with a tennis future  i began to decline around what should have been puberty  call me let s say twelve  people were talking about nafta and
something called the quote information turnpike and there was still broadcast tv  though we had a satellite dish  the academy wasn t even a
twinkle in anybody s eye  the stork would disappear periodically when money came in  i think he kept going back up to lyle in ontario  call me
age ten  we still lived in weston  known also as volvoland  the moms gardened like a fiend out there  this was something else she had to do  had
a thing about  hadn t gone to indoor plants yet  called the garden s crops her green babies  wouldn t let us eat the zucchini  never picked it  it got
monstrous and dry and fell off and rotted  big fun  but her real thing was preparing the garden every spring  she started making lists and pricing
supplies and drafting outlines in january  did i mention her own father had been a potato farmer  at one time a millionaire potato baron type
farmer  in quebec 
 but so it s early march  are those earrings electric  or is it you  how come i ve never seen those earrings up to now  i thought women who
could bring off copper earrings never wore anything but copper  you should see yourself in this light  fluorescence isn t kind to most women  it
must take an exceptional kind   
 q  
 in the moms s family plot  st  quelquechose quebec or something  never been there  his will said only not anywhere near his own dad s plot 
right near maine  heart of the concavity  the moms s home town s wiped off the map  bad ecocycles  real machete country  i d have to try to
recall the town  but so but then so the moms is out in the cold garden  it s march and it s co wold  i ve got this story down  i ve related this
incident to several family type professionals  and not one eyebrow stayed steady among them  this is the sort of antidote that makes pathogenic 

 systems pros  eyebrows go all the way up and over their skull and disappear down the back of their neck  
 so then i m let s say thirteen  which means hallie s four  the moms is in the backyard garden  tilling the infamously flinty new england soil with
a rented rototiller  the situation is ambiguous between whether it s the moms steering the rototiller or vice versa  the old machine  full of gas i d
slopped through a funnel   the moms secretly believes petroleum products give you leukemia  her solution is to pretend to herself she doesn t
know what s wrong when the thing won t work and to stand there wringing her hands and let some eager to please thirteen year old puff out his
chest at being able to diagnose the problem  and then i pour the gas  the rototiller is loud and hard to control  it roars and snorts and bucks and
my mother s stride behind it is like the stride of someone walking an untrained st  bernard  she s leaving drunken staggery footprints behind her in
the tilled dirt  behind the thing  there s something about a very very tall woman trying to operate a rototiller  the moms is incredibly tall  way
taller than everybody except the stork  who towered even over the moms  of course she d be horrified if she ever brought herself to recognize
what she was doing  orchestrating a little kid into handling the gas that she thinks might be cancerous  she doesn t even know she s phobic about
gas  she s wearing two pairs of work gloves and plastic surgery type bags over her espadrilles  which were the only footwear she could garden in 
and a fukoama microfiltration pollution mask  which you might remember those from that period  her toes are blue in the dirty plastic bags  i m a
few meters ahead of the moms  in charge of preemptive rock  and clod removal  that s her term  preemptive rock  and clod removal 
 now work with me  see this with me  in the middle of this tilling here comes my little brother hallie  maybe like four at the time and wearing
some kind of fuzzy red pajamas and a tiny little down coat  and slippers that had those awful nice day yellow smile faces on both toes  we ve been
at it maybe an hour and half  and the garden s dirt is just about tilled when hal conies out and down off the pressure treated redwood deck and
comes walking very steadily and seriously toward the border of the garden the moms had surveyed out with little sticks and string  he has his little
hand out  he s holding out something small and dark and he s coming toward the garden as the rototiller snorts and rattles behind me  dragging
the moms  as he gets closer the thing in his hand resolves into something that just doesn t look pleasant at all  hal and i look at each other  his
expression is very serious even despite that his lower lip is having a sort of little epileptic fit  which means he s getting ready to bawl  that s with a
w  i remember the air was gray with dust and the moms had her glasses on  he holds the thing out toward the moms s figure  i squint  the thing
covering his palm and hanging over the sides of the palm is a rhombusoid patch of fungus  big old patch of house mold  underline big and old  it
must have come from some hot furnace hidden corner of the basement  some corner she must have missed with the flamethrower  after the
flooding we had every january thaw  i heft a clod or rock  i m staring  every follicle i ve got is bunched and straining  you could feel the tension  it
was like standing down at sunstrand plaza when they fired the transformers  every follicle bunches and strains  it was a sort of nasal green  blackspeckled  hairy like a peach is hairy  also some orange speckles  a patch of very bad news type mold  hal looks at me in the noise  his lower lip all
over the place  he looks to the moms  the moms is intent on a plumb straight rototilled line  weaving  the piece is that the mold looks  like 
strangely incomplete  as in it dawns on me right then chewed on  helen  and yes as i squint some sickening hairy stuff is still there like impacted in
the kid s front teeth and hairily smeared around the mouth 
 be there with me  helen  feel the sort of wagnerish clouds gather  hallie always said there was always this sense as a kid with the moms that
the whole cosmos was just this side of fulminating into boiling clouds of elemental gas and was being held materially together only through heroic
exercise of will and ingenuity on the part of the moms 
 everything slows waaay down  she s coming around with the machine at the end of a row and sees hallie wearing his happy slippers outside in
the cold  which just in itself is enough to gut shot the cosmos as far as she s concerned  usually  now we re seeing the rototiller get shut down as
she bends way down to where i d showed her the choke  the machine diesels a little and farts some blue smoke  the machine sucks the nub of its
starter rope into itself  i can feel the voltage like i m still there  post racket tingling quiet descends  there s the tentative chirp of a bird  the moms
comes toward hal standing there in his little red coat  she s tucking a wisp of hair back under the special plastic cap s elastic  her hair at that time
was dark brown  she s addressing him  she has an unbelievably humiliating little family pet name for the kid that i ll show him the mercy of never
telling anybody 
 but so she s coming over  hal is standing there  holds the horrific patch of fungus out  the moms sees at first only her child holding something
out  and like all moms hardwired for motherhood she reaches to take whatever her baby holds out  the one sort of case where she wouldn t check
before reaching out toward something held out  
 q  
 the moms though now stops just inside the border of string and she squints  her glasses have dust  she starts to see and process just what it is
the kid s holding out to her  her hand s outstretched in the air over the garden s string and she stops 
 hallie takes one step forward  arm up and out in a kind of like nazi salute  he goes  i ate this

 it suddenly occurs to me that if you want stuff on the moms and the mad stork you could contact bain  he practically lived with us in weston 
as like a secondary source  i m sure he d discuss the moms s foibles all you want  the man still practically holds up a crucifix at any mention  his
little greeting card company has just been bought up by a huge novelty concern  so i m sure he s in his big room lying there having palm fronds
waved and his forehead wiped  feeling flush and voluble  i guess i d rather you didn t ask him about my foibles  but he s inexhaustible on the
subject of the moms and o c d  he never leaves home  which home is one room  the converted children s reading room of what used to be the

        orin incandenza and i played  practiced  and generally hung out through most of what seemed at the time to be our formative years  we
met because i kept encountering him across the net in the local tennis tournaments we played around metro boston  boys     s  we were the two
best    year old males in boston  we soon became practice partners  our mothers driving us every weekday afternoon to a junior development
program at the auburndale tennis club in west newton  after my own parents were horribly killed on the jamaica way commuter road one
morning in the freak crash of a radio traffic report helicopter  i became a sort of hanger on at the incandenza house out in weston  when j o i 
founded the academy  i was one of the first matriculants  orin and i were inseparable until around age     when i reached my own zenith in terms
of early puberty and athletic promise and began to be able to beat him  he took it hard  we were never inseparable again  we spent quantity time
together again briefly for a few months the next year  during a period when we both experimented heavily with recreational substances  we both
ended up losing enthusiasm for substances after only a couple years  orin because he had finally entered puberty and had discovered the weaker
sex and found he needed all his faculties and guile  myself because a couple of really negative methoxy psychedelic experiences left me with
certain disabilities that to this day make normal life an exceptional challenge  and which i tend to blame on having done deadly serious
hallucinogens at a sort of larval psychological stage during which no n  american adolescent should be allowed to do hallucinogens  these
disabilities led to my departure from the enfield tennis academy at     prior to graduation  and my withdrawal from competitive junior tennis and
contemporary life as we know it  orin was largely burned out on tennis too by     though no one in his right mind could have foreseen a defection
to organized u s  football in his future 
a grunting  crunching ballet of repressed homoeroticism  football  ms  steepley  on my view  the exaggerated breadth of the shoulders  the
masked eradication of facial personality  the emphasis on contact vs  avoidance of contact  the gains in terms of penetration and resistance  the
tight pants that accentuate the gluteals and hamstrings and what look for all the world like codpieces  the gradual slow shift of venue to  artificial
surface    artificial turf   don t the pants  fronts look fitted with codpieces  and have a look at these men whacking each other s asses after a play 
it is like swinburne sat down on his soul s darkest night and designed an organized sport  and pay no attention to orin s defense of football as a
ritualized substitute for armed conflict  armed conflict is plenty ritualized on its own  and since we have real armed conflict  take a spin through
boston s roxbury and mattapan districts some evening  there is no need or purpose for a substitute  football is pure homophobically repressed
nancy ism  and do not let o  tell you different 
       c  i cannot help you too much with the facts surrounding dr  incandenza s suicide  i know that he erased his own cartography in a grisly
way  i was told that in the year leading up to his death dr  incandenza was abusing ethyl alcohol on a daily basis and was working on a whole new
genre of film cartridge that orin at the time claimed was driving dr  inc insane 
        e  the supposed cause of their separation is that dr  incandenza began using her in his work more and more extensively and eventually
asked her to perform in the prenominate completely radical new type of filmed entertainment that supposedly was driving him to a breakdown 
they supposedly became close  james and jo ellen  though orin in my judgment is not a reliable source of information about their relationship 
the only other apposite fact i have   and i have this not from orin but from an innocent female relative of mine who was  briefly  in a position
to interface with our punter in an intimate and unguarded way impossible between hetero males   is that some incident occurred in the
incandenzas  volvo involving one of the windows and a word   all i am given is that o  reports that in the days prior to dr  incandenza s felo de
se  a so called  word  appeared on a  fogged   window  of mrs  inc s pale yellow volvo  and the word cast a conjugal pall in all sorts of directions 
this is it 
        the  vailed warning   typo   you refer to in my postal response to you is simply that you have to take what orin says in a fairly highsodium way  i am not sure i would stand and point at orin as an example of a classic pathological liar  but you have only to watch him in certain
kinds of action to see that there can be such a thing as sincerity with a motive  i have no idea what your relationship with orin is or what your
feelings are   and if orin wishes it i am afraid i can predict your feelings for him will be strong   so i shall just tell you that for instance at e t a 
i saw orin in bars or at post tournament dances go up to a young lady he would like to pick up and use this fail safe cross sectional pick up
strategy that involved an opening like  tell me what sort of man you prefer  and then i ll affect the demeanor of that man   which in a way of
course is being almost pathologically open and sincere about the whole picking up enterprise  but also has this quality of look at me being sototally open and sincere i rise above the whole disingenuous posing process of attracting someone   and  i transcend the commondisingenuity in a bar herd in a particularly hip and witty self aware way   and if you will let me pick you up i will not only keep   being this   wittily    transcendently   open      but   will   bring you   into   this  world of social falsehood transcendence  which of course he
cannot do because the whole openness demeanor thing is itself a purposive social falsehood  it is a pose of poselessness  orin incandenza is the
least open man i know  spend a little time with orin s uncle charles a k a   gretel the cross sectioned dairy cow  tavis if you want to see real
openness in motion  and you will see that genuine pathological openness is about as seductive as tourette s syndrome 
it is not that orin incandenza is a liar  but that i think he has come to regard the truth as constructed instead of reported  he came by this idea
educationally  is all i will add  he studied for almost eighteen years at the feet of the most consummate mind fucker i have ever met  and even
now he remains so flummoxed he thinks the way to escape that person s influence is through renunciation and hatred of that person  defining
yourself in opposition to something is still being anaclitic on that thing  isn t it  i certainly think so  and men who believe they hate what they really
fear they need are of limited interest  i find 
     again i will remind you that orin and i are on the outs a bit at the moment  so some of my judgments may be temporarily short on charity 
one reason orin is not a straight out liar is that orin is not a particularly skillful liar  the few times i saw him try consciously to lie were pathetic 
this is one reason why his juvenile recreational chemical phase passed so quickly compared to some of our colleagues at e t a  if you are going to
do serious drugs while you are still a minor and under your parents  roof  you are going to have to  lie often and lie well  orin was a strangely
stupid liar  i am recalling there was one afternoon on mrs  clarke s day off when mrs  inc had to go off and overfunction somewhere and orin was
supposed to baby sit mario and hal  who were at the kind of crazed toddler age where they would hurt themselves if they were not closely
supervised  and i was over  and orin and i decided to dart up to the loft over the weston house s garage to smoke a bit of bob hope  which is to
say high resin marijuana  and in the loft  high  wandered disastrously into the sort of pseudophilosophical mental labyrinth that bob hope smokers

 are always wandering into and getting trapped in and wasting huge amounts of time  inside
a  this tendency to involuted abstraction is sometimes called  marijuana thinking   and by the way  the so called  amotivational syndrome 
consequent to massive bob hope consumption is a misnomer  for it is not that bob hope smokers lose interest in practical functioning  but rather
marijuana think themselves into labyrinths of reflexive abstraction that seem to cast doubt on the very possibility of practical functioning  and the
mental labor of finding one s way out consumes all available attention and makes the bob hope smoker look physically torpid and apathetic and
amoti vated sitting there  when really he is trying to claw his way out of a labyrinth  note that the overwhelming hunger  the so called  munchies  
that accompanies cannabis intoxication may be a natural defense mechanism against this kind of loss of practical function  since there is no more
practical function anywhere than foraging for food 
an intellectual room they cannot negotiate their way out of  and by the time we hadn t resolved the abstract problem that had put us into the
labyrinth but just as always had gotten so hungry we abandoned it and stumbled out and down the loft s wooden ladder  the sun was all the way
on the other side of the sky over wayland and sudbury  and the whole afternoon had passed without hal and mario having received any protective
supervision  and hal and mario somehow survived the afternoon  but when mrs  incan denza returned that night she asked orin what we and the
supervised toddlers had done all afternoon and orin lied that we had all been right here  respectively playing and supervising  and mrs  incandenza
expressed puzzlement to orin because she said she had tried to call the house several times that afternoon but was unable to get through  and
orin replied that while supervising he had herded the toddlers carefully into rooms with phone jacks and made calls and had been on the phone
several times for jong periods of time for this that or the other thing  was why she had been unable to get through  at which mrs  incandenza  who
is extremely tall  had blinked several times and looked very confused and said that but the phone had not been busy  it had just rung and rung and
rung  at a juncture like this  men and boys get separated in terms of prevarication  i submit  and all orin could come up with was a steady gaze as
he said  as if from the rose garden   i have no response to that   which incredibly stupid response he and i found very funny for weeks afterward 
especially since mrs  incandenza never punished and refused to act as if she believed lying was even a possibility as far as her children were
concerned  and treated an exploded lie as an insoluble cosmic mystery instead of an exploded lie 
the worst instance of both orin s mendacious idiocy and mrs  incandenza s unwillingness to countenance an idiotic lie came one grisly day soon
after orin had finally gotten his vehicle operator s license  o  and i found ourselves with an idle weekday afternoon off in august after losing early
at a synthetic grass tournament down at long wood  and hal was still alive in what was then boys     s and thus a good bit of the e t a  summer
community was still down at longwood  including mario and mrs  incandenza  who d been driven down i remember by a sort of swarthily foreignlooking moniiial internist medical resident mrs  inc had introduced as a so called  dear and cherished friend  but hadn t explained how they d met 
and dr  incandenza was indisposed and not in a position to bother anyone that day  i remember  and orin and i had most of e t a  to ourselves 
even the gate s portcullis unmanned and up  and this being at the acme of our interest in such things we wasted little time in ingesting some sort
of recreational substance  i cannot recall what kind but i remember them as particularly impairing  and we decided however that we weren t yet
impaired enough  and decided to drive down the hill to one of the disreputable liquor stores along commonwealth avenue that accepted your word
of honor as proof of age  and we hopped into the volvo and blasted down the hill and down commonwealth avenue  severely impaired  and
wondered in a speculative way why people on the sidewalks all along commonwealth seemed to be waving at us and holding their heads and
pointing and jumping wildly up and down  and orin waving cheerfully back and holding his own head in a sort of friendly imitation  but it was not
until we got all the way down to the commonwealth brighton ave  split that the horrible realization hit us  mrs  incandenza often during summer
days kept the incandenzas  beloved dog s  johnson leashed to the back of her volvo within reach of his water and science diet bowls  and orin
and i had peeled out in the car without even thinking to check for whether s  johnson was attached to it  i will not try to describe what we found
when we pulled into a parking lot and slunk to the rear of the car  let s call it a nubbin  let s say what we found was a leash and collar  and a
nubbin  according to the couple of witnesses who were able to speak  s  johnson had made a valiant go of trying to keep up back there for at least
a couple blocks down commonwealth  but at some point he either lost his footing or got his canine affairs in order and figured it was his day to
shuffle off  and gave up  and hit the pavement  after which the scene the witnesses described was unspeakable  there was fur and let s call it
material down the middle of the inside east bound lane for five or six blocks  what we had left to take slowly back up the academy s hill was a
leash  a collar with tags describing medication allergies and food sensitivities  and a nubbin of let s call it attached material 
the point is that i defy you to imagine how it felt later that day to stand there with orin in the hmh living room before the prone and piteously
weeping mrs  incandenza and listen to orin try to construct a version of events in which he and i had sensed somehow that s  johnson was dying
for a good brisk august walk and were walking him down commonwealth    saying there we were walking good old s  johnson demurely down the
sidewalk when a hit and run driver not only swerved up onto the sidewalk to run the dog down but then backed up and ran him over again and
backed up and ran him over again  and on and on  so more like a pulverize and run driver  while orin and i had stood there too paralyzed with
horror and grief even to think of noticing the make and color of the car  much less the fiend s license plate  mrs  incan denza on her knees  there s
something surreal about a very tall woman on her knees   weeping and pressing her hand to her collarbone but nodding in confirmation at every
syllable of orin spinning this pathetic lie  o  holding up the leash and collar  and nubbin  like exhibit a  with me next to him wiping my forehead
and wishing the immaculately polished and sterilized hardwood floor would swallow up the whole scene in toto 
        ms  steeples  to my way of thinking  the word  abuse  is vacuous  who can define  abuse   the difficulty with really interesting cases of
abuse is that the ambiguity of the abuse becomes part of the abuse  thanks over the decades to the energetic exercise of your own profession  ms 
steeley  we have all heard acoas and alateens and aconas and acogs and whiners relate clear cases of different kinds of abuse  beatings 
diddlings  rapes  deprivations  domineerment  humiliation  captivity  torture  excessive criticism or even just utter disinterest  but at least the
victims of this sort of abuse can  when they have dredged it back up after childhood  confidently call it  abuse   there are  however  more
ambiguous cases  harder to profile  one might say  what would you call a parent who is so neurasthenic and depressive that any opposition to his
parental will plunges him into the sort of psychotic depression where he does not leave his bed for days and just sits there in bed cleaning his
revolver  so that the child would be terrified of opposing his will and plunging him into a depression and maybe causing him to suicide  would that
child qualify as  abused   or a father who is so engrossed by mathematics that he gets engrossed helping his child with his algebra homework and
ends up forgetting the child and doing it all himself so that the child gets an a in fractions but never in fact learns fractions  or even say a father
who is extremely handy around the house and can fix anything  and has the son help him  but gets so engrossed in his projects  the father  that he
never thinks to explain to the son how the projects actually get done  so that the son s  help  never advances past simply handing the father a
specified wrench or getting him lemonade or phillips head screws until the day the father is crushed into aspic in a freak accident on the jamaica
way and all opportunities for transgenerational instruction are forever lost  and the son never learns how to be a handy homeowner himself  and
when things malfunction around his own one room home he has to hire contemptuous filthy nailed men to come fix them  and feels terribly
inadequate  the son   not only because he is not handy but because this handiness seemed to him to have represented to his father everything
that was independent and manly and non disabled in an american male  would you cry  abuse   if you were the unhandy son  looking back 
worse  could you call it abuse without feeling that you were a pathetic self indulgent piss puddle  what with all the genuine cases of hair raising
physical and emotional abuse diligently reported and analyzed daily by conscientious journalists  and profiled   
i am not sure whether you could call this abuse  but when i was  long ago  abroad in the world of dry men  i saw parents  usually upscale and
educated and talented and functional and white  patient and loving and supportive and concerned and involved in their children s lives  profligate
with compliments and diplomatic with constructive criticism  loquacious in their pronouncements of unconditional love for and approval of their
children  conforming to every last jot tittle in any conceivable definition of a good parent  i saw parent after unimpeachable parent who raised kids
who were  a  emotionally retarded or  b  lethally self indulgent or  c  chronically depressed or  d  bor  derline psychotic or  e  consumed with
narcissistic self loathing or  f  neurotically driven addicted or  g  variously psychosomatically disabled or  h  some conjunctive permutation of  a     
 g  now  orin had never once walked s  johnson  orin was not even all that keen on s  johnson  because the dog was always trying to mate with
his left leg  and anyway  s  johnson was very much mrs  incandenza s dog  and was normally exercised only by mrs  incandenza  and at rigidly

 specific times of day 
 
why is this  why do many parents who seem relentlessly bent on producing children who feel they are good persons deserving of love produce
children who grow to feel they are hideous persons not deserving of love who just happen to have lucked into having parents so marvelous that
the parents love them even though they are hideous 
is it a sign of abuse if a mother produces a child who believes not that he is innately beautiful and lovable and deserving of magnificent maternal
treatment but somehow that he is a hideous unlovable child who has somehow lucked in to having a really magnificent mother  probably not 
but could such a mother then really be all that magnificent  if that s the child s view of himself 
i am not speaking about my own mother  who was decapitated by a plummeting rotorblade long before she could have much effect one way or
the other on my older brother and innocent younger sister and me 
i think  mrs  starkly  that i am speaking of mrs  avril m  t  incandenza  although the woman is so multileveled and indictment proof that it is
difficult to feel comfortable with any sort of univocal accusation of anything  something just was not right  is the only way to put it  something
creepy  even on the culturally stellar surface  for instance  after orin had pretty clearly killed her beloved dog s  johnson in a truly awful if accidental way  and then had tried to evade responsibility for it with a lie that a parent far less intelligent than avril could have seen right through  mrs 
inc s response was not only not conventionally abusive  but seemed almost too unconditionally loving and compassionate and selfless to possibly be
true  her response to orin s pathetic pulverize and run driver lie was not to act credulous so much as to act as if the entire grotesque fiction had
never reached her ears  and her response to the dog s death itself was bizarrely furcated  on the one hand  she mourned s  johnson s death very
deeply  took the leash and collar and canine nubbin tenderly and arranged lavish memorial and funeral arrangements  including a heartbreakingly
small cherrywood coffin  cried in audible private for weeks  etc  but the other half of her emotional energies went into being overly solicitous and
polite toward orin  upping the daily compliment and reinforcement dose  arranging for favorite foods at e t a  meals  having his favorite little
tennis appurtenances appear magically in his bed and locker with loving notes attached  basically making the thousands of little gestures by which
the technically stellar parent can make her child feel particularly valued    all out of concern that orin in no way think she resented him for s 
johnson s death or blamed him or loved him less in any way because of the whole incident  not only was there no punishment or even visible
pique  but the love and support bombardment increased  and all this was coupled with elaborate machinations to keep the mourning and funeral
arrangements and moments of wistful dog remembrance hidden from orin  for fear that he might see that the moms was hurt and so feel bad or
guilty  so that in his presence mrs  inc became even more cheerful and loquacious and witty and intimate and benign  even suggesting in oblique
ways that life was now somehow suddenly better without the dog  that some kind of unrecognized albatross had been somehow removed from her
neck  and so on and so forth 
what does a trained analyst of our cultural profile s soft contours like yourself make of this  mrs  starksaddle  is it mind bogglingly considerate
and loving and supportive  or is there something       creepy about it  maybe a more perspicuous question  was the almost pathological generosity
with which mrs  inc responded to her son taking her car in an intoxicated condition and dragging her beloved dog to its grotesque death and then
trying to lie his way out of it  was this generosity for orin s sake  or for avril s own  was it orin s  self esteem  she was safeguarding  or her own
vision of herself as a more stellar moms than any human son could ever hope to feel he merits 
when orin does his impression of avril   which i doubt you or anyone else can get him to do anymore  though it was a party stopper back in
our days at the academy   what he will do is assume an enormous warm and loving smile and move steadily toward you until he is in so close that
his face is spread up flat against your own face and c  yes   all right   this may start to touch on it  not  valuable  but  valued  your breaths
mingle  if you can get to experience it   the impression   which will seem worse to you  the smothering proximity  or the unimpeachable warmth
and love with which it s effected 
for some reason now i am thinking of the sort of philanthropist who seems humanly repellent not in spite of his charity but because of it  on
some level you can tell that he views the recipients of his charity not as persons so much as pieces of exercise equipment on which he can develop
and demonstrate his own virtue  what s creepy and repellent is that this sort of philanthropist clearly needs privation and suffering to continue 
since it is his own virtue he prizes  instead of the ends to which the virtue is ostensibly directed 
everything orin s mother is about is always terribly well ordered and multivalent  i suspect she was badly abused as a child  i have nothing
concrete to back this up 
but if  ms  bainbridge  you have yielded your own charms to orin  and if orin strikes you as a wonderfully gifted and giving lover   which by
various accounts he is   not just skilled and sensuous but magnificently generous  empathic  attentive  loving   if it seems to you that he does 
truly  derive his own best pleasure from giving you pleasure  you might wish to reflect soberly on this vision of orin imitating his dear moms as
philanthropist  a person closing in  arms open wide  smiling

wills of the six ranged along the track  and their estimates of one another s will to risk all to win  
struck transposes clearly nonadolescent uptown material like this into   the variable of the game isn t so much a matter of the train  but the
player s courage and will  
 the last few instants  vanishingly small  when the player may hurl himself athwart the expanse of track  across timber ties  creosote stench 
gravel and scarred iron  amid the ear splitting scream of the whistle almost overhead  able to feel the huge push of terrible air from the transport s
cow catcher or express train s rounded nose  to go sprawling in the gravel past the tracks  other side and roll to see wheels and flanges  couplings
and driving rods  the furious back and forth of transverse axles  feeling the whistle s steam condense to drizzle all around      these few seconds
are known  familiar as their own pulse  to the boys who assemble and play   struck s now progressed to grinding the whole heel of his hand into his
eyesocket  producing a kind of ectoplasmic pinwheel of red in there  did like even pre bullet railroad engines have flanges and cowcatchers and
whistles that steamed 
in a disastrous lapse  struck copies hurl himself athwart  a decidedly un struckish sounding verb phrase  verbatim into his text 
       that the true variable which renders le jeu du prochain train a contest and not merely a game involves the nerve and heart and willingness
to risk all of any or all of the five waiting beside you at the track  how long can they wait  when will they choose  their lives and limb worth how
much queen headed coin this night  more radical by far than the american youth automobile game of  chicken  to which its principle is frequently
compared  five  not one  different wills to comparatively gauge  in addition to your own will s resolve  and no motion or action to distract you from
the tension of waiting motionlessly to move  waiting as one by one the other five quail and save themselves  leap to beat the train        and then
the sentence just ends  without even a close to the parenthesis  though struck  with a canny sense for this sort of thing  knows the analogy to
chicken    ring just the right bell  term paper wise 
 le jeu s historic best  reportedly  however  ignore their five competitors completely  concentrating their entire attention on determining the last
viable instant in which to leap  regarding the last  final  and only true opponent in the game to be their own will  mettle  and intuition about the last
viable instant in which to leap  these nerveless few  le jeu s finest      many of whom will go on to directeur future jeux  if not  often  to
membership in les assassins or its stelliform offshoots       these nerveless and self contained virtuosi never see their opponents  flinches or tics or
the darkenings at corduroys  crotches  none of the normal signs of will faltering which lesser players scan for      for the game s finest players
frequently close their eyes entirely as they wait  trusting the railroad ties  vibration and the whistle s pitch  as well as intuition  and fate  and
whatever numinous influences lie just beyond fate   struck at certain points imagines himself gathering this wild conceits guy s lapels together with
one hand and savagely and repeatedly slapping him with the other   forehand  backhand  forehand 
 the cult s game s principle is simple  the last of the six to jump before the train and land intact wins the round  the fifth through the second to
leap have lost  but acquitted themselves 
 the first in a round to quail and jump walks home from there  alone under the moon  disgraced and ashamed 
 but even the first to quail and jump has jumped  far beyond prohibited  not to jump at all is regarded as impossible  to  perdre son coeur  and
not jump at all is outside le jeu s limit  the possibility simply does not exist  it is unthinkable  only once  in le jeu du prochain train s extensive oral
history  has a miner s son not jumped  lost his heart and frozen  remaining on his jut as the round s train passed  this player later drowned   perdre son coeur  when it is mentioned at all  is known also as  faire un bernard wayne   in dubious honor of this lone unjumping asbestos miner s
son  about whom little beyond his subsequent drowning in the baskatong reservoir is known  his name denoting a figure of ridicule and disgust
among speakers of the papineau region vulgate   disastrously  struck blithely transposes this stuff too  with not even a miniature appliance size

 bulb flickering anywhere over his head 
 the game s object is to jump last and land still fully limbed upon the opposite embankment 
 expresses are    k p h  faster than conventional transports  but a transport s cow catcher mangles  a boy struck head on by a moving train is
shot as from a cannon  knocked out of his shoes  describes a towering  flailing arc  and is transported home in a burlap sack  a player caught
beneath a wheel and run over is frequently spread out along a hundred red meters or more of reddened track  and is transported home in a
number of ceremonial asbestos and nickel mining shovels provided by the jeu s older and frequently dismembered directeurs 
 as happens more often  purportedly  a boy who has dived more than half way across the tracks when he is struck and hit  loses one or more
legs      either there on the spot  if lucky  or later  under surgical gas and orthopedic saws applied to what are customarily violently angled masses
of unrecognizably contuded meat   the paradox here for struck as plagiarist  who needs something with sufficient detail to be able to basically just
rehash  is that this thing here has almost too much detail  much of it purple  it doesn t even seem all that scholarly  it seems more like the wild
conceits bayside c c  guy seemed to get more and more tipsy as the thing went on until he felt free to make a lot of it up  like e g  the contudedmeat bits  etc  what s interesting to hal incandenza about his take on struck  sometimes pemulis  evan ingersoll  et al  is that congenital plagiarists
put so much more work into camouflaging their plagiarism than it would take just to write up an assignment from conceptual scratch  it usually
seems like plagiarists aren t lazy so much as kind of navigationally insecure  they have trouble navigating without a detailed map s assurance that
somebody has been this way before them  about this incredible painstaking care to hide and camouflage the plagiarism   whether it s dishonesty
or a kind of kleptomaniacal thrill seeking or what   hal hasn t developed much of any sort of take 
 it is frightfully simple and straightforward  sometimes the last of the six to jump is struck  then the second to last leaper becomes the last and
victor  and advances  each winner literally  surviving  into the game s next round  a sort of sextupled semi final  six rounds of six canadian boys
each  the  quote   les trente six  for the evening  the initial rounds  boys      those who have been neither the last nor the disgraceful first to
leap      are permitted to stay at the le passage a niveau de vote ferree  assembled to become the semi finals  silent audience  the entire le jeu
du prochain train is customarily conducted in silence   in a disastrous and maybe unconsciously self destructive set of lapses  struck rehabilitates
the prose but keeps a lot of the hallucinatory specific descriptive stuff in  unfootnoted  though there s obviously no way he could pretend to have
been there 
 the surviving losers from among the les trente six then swell the ranks of the silent gallery as the six nerveless winners      the finalists  this
night s  attendants longtemps ses tours       some bleeding or gray with shock  survivors already of two separate long delayed leaps and
hairbreadth escapes  eyes blank or closed  mouths working in savored distaste  await the nightly      express  the ultra ionized  le train de la
foudre  from mont tremblant to ottawa  they will jump athwart the tracks in front of its high speed nose at the final moment  each trying to be
the last to leap and live  it is not rare for several of the le jeu s finalists to be struck   struck tries to decide whether it d be unrealistic or unselfconsciously realistic to keep using his own name as a verb   would a man with anything to camouflage use his own name as a verb 
       that several among the la culte du prochain train s survivors and organizational directorate went on to found and comprise les assassins
des fauteuils rollents is beyond sociohistorical dispute  though the precise ideological relation between the b s  era s simultaneously chivalric and
nihilistic cult of the train s savage tournaments and the present s limbless cell of anti o n a n  extremists remains the subject of the same scholarly
debate that surrounds the evolution of northern quebec s la culte de baiser sans fin into the not particularly dreaded but media savvy fils de
montcalm cell credited with the helicoptered dropping of the    meter  human waste filled  pie shell onto the rostrum of u s  president gentle s

 as with the la culte du prochain train  the cult of the endless kiss of the iron mining regions surrounding the gulf of st  lawrence  coalesced
around a periodic  tournament style competition  this one comprised of    adolescent canadian participants  of whom one half were female   thus 
the first round pitted    couples  each of which consisted of one male and one female quebecker   struck is trying to phone hal  but gets only his
room s wearisome phone machine message  can you ever say pitted without some kind of against in there someplace later in the sentence  struck
envisions the wild conceit scholar utterly strafed by this time  the guy s eyes crossed and his head lolling and having to cover one eye with a hand
just to see a single screen  and typing with his nose  but with the apparent self destructive credulity that characterizes many plagiarists  no matter
how gifted  struck goes ahead and puts in the complementless pitted  imagining forehand and backhand slaps all the while   of each pair  one half

organizing cultist with occlusive tape  who then expertly employed the thumb and forefinger of both hands to seal the combatants  nostrils  thus 
the battle of the endless kiss had been joined  the entire lung contents of the designatedly inhaled player was then exhaled orally into the emptied
lungs of his or her opponent  who in turn exhaled the inhalation back to its original owner  and so forth  back and forth  the same air being traded
back and forth  with oxygen and carbon dioxide ratios becoming progressively more spartan  until the organizer holding their nostrils closed
officially declared one combatant or the other to be  evanoui  or   swooned   either fallen to the ground or out on his or her feet  the theoretics of

 no  look  it s still rise over run  the derivative s the slope of the tangent at some point along the function  it doesn t matter what point until
they give you the point on the test  
 will this even be on the boards  do they go past trig  
 this is fucking trig  they ll give you word problems that may involve changing quantities   something accelerating  a voltage  inflation of
o n a n  currency over u s  currency  differentiation ll save you half the time  all those triangles inside triangles to figure change with trig  trig s a
unit bender on rate changes  derivatives re just trig with some imagination  you imagine the points moving inexorably toward each other until for
all practical purposes they re the same point  the slope of a defined line becomes the slope of a tangent to one point  
 one point that s in fact actually two points  
 you use your goddamn imagination  inc  plus a couple prescribed limits  which they won t fuck with you on limits on the general test  trust me 
this is a big pink titty compared to an eschaton calculation  you move the two points you re doing rise over run on infitesimally close together 
you end up with a plug in formula  
 can i tell you about my dream now and then we ll use the momentum from that to plow through this  
 just write this on your wrist or something  function x  exponent n  the derivative s going to be nx   xn   for any kind of first order rate ofincrease thing they re going to ask you  this assumes a definable limit  of course  which no way they re going to fuck with you on limits on the
fucking boards  
 it was a dmz dream  
 do you see how you re going to apply this to a rate of increase type little story they ll pose  
 it involved your experimental soldier  the massive dose  
 let me just close this door  here  
 it was the leavenworth convict  the one you said had left the planet  the one belting out ethel merman  it was horrific  mikey  in the dream i
was the soldier  
 so you re now going to assume a real you know what experience will be similar to the experience of a nightmare  
 aha  why nightmare  why do you assume it was a nightmare  did i use the word nightmare  
 you used the word horrific  i assume it wasn t a romp through the heather  
 in the dream the horror was that i wasn t really singing  there s no business like show business   i was really screaming for help  i was
screaming like  help  i m screaming for help and everybody s acting as if i m singing ethel merman covers  it s me  it s me  screaming for help    
 a rusk level dream  inc  a standard nobody understands me dream  the dmz and mermanization were incidental  
 there was a quality of loneliness to it  though  unlike anything  to be screaming that i m screaming for help instead of singing a show tune and
to have the wardens and doctors gathered around snapping their fingers and tapping their feet  
 have i mentioned dmz doesn t show up on a g c  m s   struck tracked this down off an obscure digestive flora footnote  it s the fitviavi mold
base  if the stuff shows up at all it shows as a slight case of unbalanced yeast  
 i thought only girls got yeast  
 inc  don t be so fucking naive  data number two is struck is halfway toward nailing down that this stuff s original intent was to induce what they
called quote transcendent experiences in get this chronic alcoholics in the like     s at verdun protestant hospital in montreal  
 how come everywhere i turn this fall now everybody s suddenly mentioning quebec in all kinds of radically different contexts  orin s calling with
some protracted obsession about anti o n a n  quebecers  
       tavis up and announces quebec are the lambs in this year s fundraiser  your mum s from quebec  
 and then this term of all terms i take poutrincourt s insurgency class  which is basically a quebecathon    
 oh i definitely i d suspect some kind of conspiracy or trap  it s obvious everything s pointing toward getting you in a cell belting out mermanalia 
inc  i think your hinges are starting to squeak  i think this is what plateaux hopping up to the top does to somebody  i think a meaningful
transcendent dmz type non uremic fallout interlude before tucson is just what the carpenter ordered  for the old hinges  keep you from going
back to just smoking that bob hope day in day out when the test s up  shit ll kill your lungs  shit ll make you fat  soft  moist and pale  inc  seen it
happen  you need something more than a    day cleanout  the tu sais que could be just the reconfiguration you need to start branching out 
leave the bob hope alone  find something you can take to college or the show and not get paralyzed  shit ll paralyze you over time  incblob  saw it
happen time and over  back in the neighborhood  once promising stand up guys spending their lives in front of the tp  eating nutter butters and
whacking off into an old sock  the shit fairy moves in with luggage for an extended stay  inc  plus indecisive  you haven t seen indecisive til you ve
seen a guy with little fat titties slumped in a chair in his tenth year of nonstop bob hope  it s not pretty  incster my friend it s not pretty at all  a
transcendent experience with me and the axhandle could be just what the hinges are squeaking for  be around some other people for a change 
don t make me sit there with just axhandle babbling about yale  leave the visine at home  
 was it transcendent  the term in struck s literature  or was it transcendental  
   s the difference for christ s sake  
 mike  what if i said i ve been moving toward more than just a month off  
 abandon all hope   this what i was talking  
 i mean maybe make a decision  forever  what if it was that i was doing it more and more and it was getting less fun but i was still doing it
more and more  and the only way to moderate would be to like wave a hankie at it altogether  
 i applaud  some low risk transcendentalism with me and the human hatchet could be just the impotence for this kind of like major re  
 but it d be everything  blue flames  the odd  drine  if i do anything i know i d go back to the bob  i d drop madame psychosis with you guys
and all my firmest resolve would melt and i d have the one hitter out and be sniveling at you to spring some eternal hope on me  
 you re so naive  inc  you re so sharp in one way and such a little bald little fat legged baby in the woods in others  you think you re just going to
go here i go  deciding  and reverse total thrust and quit everything  
 what i said was what if  
 hal  you are my friend  and i ve been friends to you in ways you don t even have a clue  so brace yourself for a growth spurt  you want to quit
because you re starting to see you need it  and   
 that s exactly it  peems  think how horrible that d be  if somebody needed it  not just liked it a great great great deal  needing it becomes a
whole separate order of      it seems horrific  it seems like the difference between really loving something and being   
 say the word  inc  
 because you know why  what if it s true  the word  what if you are  so the answer s just walk away  if you re addicted you need it  hallie  and
   

 if you need it what do you imagine happens if you just hoist the white flag and try to go on without it  without anything  
 you lose your mind  inc  you die inside  what happens if you try and go without something the machine needs  food  moisture  sleep  o  
what happens to the machine  think about it  
 you were just now applauding the idea of abandoning all hope  you were just invoking an image of me with breasts  masturbating into laundry 
with cobwebs between my ass and a chair  
 that s the bob  i didn t hear me say everything  if you need the bob  inc  you can only quit the bob if you move onward and up to something
else  
 harder drugs  just like those old filmstrips about pot opening the door to larger drugs  where jiminy cricket   
 oh fuck you  it doesn t have to be harder  it just has to be something  i know guys quit heroin  coke  how  they make the strategic move to a
case a day of coors  or to methadone  whatever  i know hard drinking guys inc that got off the booze by switching to the bob hope  me myself 
you ve seen  i switch all the time  the trick is the right switch for a man s wiring  i m saying a real cobweb blaster with me and axford after the
fundraiser could help you get some serious perspective  cut the babytalk and sweeping bullshit decisions there s no way you can do and start
getting a real handle on how you re going to branch out away from this bob thing  which i applaud the getting away from the bob for you  inc  it s
not your thing  you were starting to get that look of a guy that ll end up with tits  
 so you re in a very subtle way lobbying for a dmz drop by saying you don t believe i could simply quit everything  since you sure don t plan to
quit  with your left eye wobbling all over the place  you haven t even quit the tenuate   winners don t ever have to quit  and all delint s little   
 i didn t hear me say none of that  and i think you probably could quit it all  for a while  you re not a pussy  you ve got balls  i know  i bet you
could gut it out  
 for a while  you re saying  
 and but what do you think would happen after a while  though  without something you need 
 what  you re saying i d grab my chest and keel over  clutch my head in the middle of a tap   whack and die of an aneurism like that girl last
year at atwood  
 no  but you d die inside  maybe outside too  but what i ve seen  if you re the real thing and need it and just cut yourself off of it altogether  you
die inside  you lose your mind  i ve seen it happen  cold turkey they call it  the bird  white knuckling  guys that d just quit everything because they
were in too deep and quit it all and just died  
 a clipperton  you mean  you re saying himself killed himself because he got sober  because he didn t get sober  there was a thing of wild
turkey right there on the counter by the oven he blew his fucking head up with  so don t try to kertwang me with him  mike  
 inc  what i know about your da could be inscribed with a blunt crayon along the rim of a shot glass  i m talking guys i know  wolf spiders 
allston guys  that quit  some did a clipperton  yes  some ended up in the mental marriott  some got through by they joined na or a cult or some
bug eyed church and went around with ties talking about jesus or surrendering  but that shit s not going to work for you because you re too sharp
to ever buy the god squad shit  most nothing big happened  that needed it and quit  they got up and went to work and came home and ate and
went to sleep and got up  day after day  but dead  like machines  you could almost see the keys in their backs  you looked into their maps and
something was gone  the walking dead  they loved it so much they needed it and gave it up and now they were waiting to die  something was all
over  inside  
 their joie de vivre  the fire in the belly  
 hal  it s been what  now  for you  two and a half days without  three days  how you feeling in there already  brother  
 i m all right  
 uh huh  incpuddle  all i know s i m your friend  i am  you don t want to communate with the madame  you can hold me and ax s purses for us 
you do what you want and point me toward whoever tells you different  i m just giving you the advice to look a little further past that second of
deciding something i know you won t let yourself take back  
 some vital part of my like personhood would die without something to ingest  this is your view  
 sometimes you don t listen real well  hallie  that s all right  spend some time figuring out this needing  like what part of you s come to need it 
do you think  
 you re alleging that s the part that ll die  
 just whatever part you feel has come to need what you re planning to take away from it  
 the part that s dependent or incomplete  you mean  the addict   
 that s just a word

   november   year of the depend adult undergarment sometimes at odd little times of day the e t a  males  locker room
downstairs in comm  ad  is empty  and you can go in there and sort of moon around and listen to the showers drip and the drains gurgle  you can
feel the odd stunned quality customarily crowded places have at empty times  you can take your time dressing  flex in front of the big plate mirror
over the sink  the mirror has projecting side mirrors so you can check out the old biceps from either side  see the jawline in profile  practice
expressions  try to look all natural and uncomposed so you can try to see what you really might normally look like to other people  the air in the
locker room hangs heavy with the smells of underarms  deodorant  benzoin  camphonated powder  serious feet  old steam  also lemon pledge and
a slight smell of electrical burn from overused blow dryers  traces of powder and fuller s earth  on the blue carpeting  down in too deep to get out
without a steamer  you can take a comb out of the big jar of barbicide on the shelf by the sink  and like a     caliber blow dryer  and experiment

claims the benches do something palliative for his spinal funiculi  more often there s one of dave s incredibly old and interchangeable menial task
janitors in here running a carpet sweeper or spraying industrial disinfectant in the urinals  you can go into the shower area and not turn the water
on and sing  really let go  michael pemulis s own vocals sound pro quality good to him  but only when he s surrounded by shower tile  sometimes
when it s empty in here you can catch snatches of voices and intriguing feminine hygienic noises from the females  locker room on the other side of
the lockers  wall 
at most other times of day  your certain type of more delicately constituted e t a  jr  uses the primitive subdorm hall showers and sinks and
avoids the packed locker room at almost all costs  no way western man ever should have conceived of commodes and hot showers in the same
crowded air space  t  schacht can clear out most of a steamy locker room just by lumbering into a commode stall and driving the latch home with
a certain purposeful force 
the prorectors have their own showers in a kind of lounge near their rooms in the secondary tunnel  with a viewer and recliners and a little
fridgelet and a dicky proof door 
when m  m  pemulis came down to dress for p m s at about     h  b the only people in the locker room were    a lobber nonpareil todd
possalthwaite  hunched and weeping  and keith freer  whom pemulis was to play and who looked in no hurry to get dressed and out there to play 
and could very possibly have been the thing that was making postal weight weep  the so called  viking  was shirtless and had a towel around his
neck and was at the mirror ministering to his skin  he had high hard white blond hair and an extremely muscular neck and lower jaw  with a certain
type of protrusive gonions that made his upper face look tapered and sly  his hair always reminded hal incandenza of frozen surf  hal said  todd

 possalthwaite was near nude and hunched on the bench under his locker  his face in his hands  with its nose s white bandages visible through
spread fingers  weeping softly  shoulders trembling 
pemulis  who s postal weight s big buddy and sort of lob and eschaton mentor and genuinely likes the kid  dropped his gear and gave him a sort
of male affectionate fake one two punch like think fast     s the nose  todder   like all of them  pemulis could do his locker s combination by feel 
from months and years of constant combination doing  he was looking all around himself and the room  freer made a slight noise when pemulis
asked the postman if there was anything he could do 
nothing s true   postal weight sobbed  his voice palm muffled  rocking slightly on the bench  his locker was open and little boy cluttered  he was
wearing only an an unbuttoned little flannel shirt and a johnson   johnson jr  jock strap  and had tiny white feetc and delicate little shell like toes 
he was supposed to be in donni stott s valley map laugher right now  pemulis knew 
 what  metaphysical angst at thirteen   pemulis directs the question to the quote viking s reflection s eye in the mirror  freer s back is tapered
and uncolloped and for a tennis player s back has superb latissimal definition but is mottled slightly from repeated applications and defoliations of
pledge  freer being a profligate pledge user because he is complexion obsessed and has the sort of nordicular skin that peels instead of tanning 
he still has his jeans and loafers on  pemulis sees  pemulis keeps waiting for the distinctive attitudinal upswing of two pre match tenuate
spansules d pemulis s locker is both full and very precisely ordered  practically alphabetized  like the trunk of an experienced seaman 
disassemblable scale and armamentarium and mood altering substances used to be concealed in several factory concealed niches in the special
system of niche riddled portable shelving pemulis had installed at age     plus small cloth packets of ground cayenne pepper  to foil the alwaysremotely possible sniffer dog  when he was a callow youth  this was before the discovery of the ultimate entrepot above the false ceiling in
subdorm b s male hallway 
 just a disappointed dinkle   freer s chuckle tends to be mirthless   what i could get out of him before the waterworks  postal weight s old man
promised him so and so if the kid accomplishes thus and such   his speech was distorted because he was ballooning his cheek with his tongue and
applying flesh tinted cream to a possible pimple there   and the postmaster here feels like he s held up his side of the accomplishment  and now i
get the drift daddy s backing out  
possalthwaite s shoulders continued to tremble as he cried into his hands 
 in other words welching you re saying the dad is   pemulis said to freer 
 i gather now the dad s trying to restructure the original deal all of a sudden  
pemulis undid his belt   the dangled carrot s snatched away  the brass ring plays hard to get  to coin a maxim  
 something about disney world  before the wa wa started  
pemulis removed his nonplay sneakers by scraping downward at one heel with the other sneaker s toe  looking down into the tender little whorl
in the center of possalth waite s hair  he d never be so ephebic as to verbally ask freer if he had plans to suit up so they could get out there  he d
never let freer think he was renting freer space in his head before the match started   postman  is this because of the eschaton incident  is it
because of the nose  because i can get on the horn and tell old postal weight sr  they re blaming nobody under     it turns out  you should tell
him  todder  there s whole land barges of shit  but none of it s spraying in you guys s direction  you should take comfort  
 nothing s true   possalthwaite keened  not looking up  muffled  ilat nippled  fatless in the young gut  feet spectral below his legs  brown 
rocking  shaking his head  looking terribly young and innocently vulnerable  sort of pre moral  little white strips of bandage protuded from his
palms  outer edges  from i  day s apocalypse 
 well  not much is fair  anyway   pemulis conceded  the viking made a noise at himself 
pemulis calls postal weight s father up on screen  minneapolis area developer  malls  corporate parks  bustling places at the edges of roaring
beltways  late forties  slim  an overmanaged tan  a little oversharp in the dress dept   with a motivational seminar type hard sell charm  a dagger
of a dad  with a pencil mustache and blinding shoe leather  he tried to conjure an image of this paternal figure hitting keith freer on the noggin
with a rolling pin and a bald cartoon lump rising from freer s skull   pemulis calculates a win or even three setter w  freer would mean a place on
the whataburger plane  is why he s willing to violate a kind of personal honor code and take pre match tenuate  which even with the    hourelimination curve is kind of cavalier  given that he and inc d escaped on spot urinalysis only because pemulis implied to mrs  incandenza that he d
tell the incster about avril having some sort of major sport interlude with john wayne  and avril is kind of a coldly biding her time not to befucked with administrative figure  and along with c    gretel the cross sectioned cow   tavis isn t exactly a fan of pemulis anyway  certainly since
the electrified rusk doorknob and litigation incident  the  drines didn t seem to be kicking in  instead of the surge of stomachless competitive
verve  all pemulis felt was a slight unpleasant spaciness and a kind of enforced feeling dryness in his eyes and mouth  like he s facing into a warm
wind   pemulis had never once seen his own da in anything other than a white hanes t shirt gone permanent yellow under the arms 
 nothing s fair because nothing s true   possalthwaite wept into his palms  his little flannel shoulders shook 
something old in one of the shower drains sighed and gurgled  a nauseous sound 
 buck up   pemulis was removing all necessary match articles and refolding them and placing them in his noncomplimentary dunlop gear bag
with military precision  he put a foot on the bench and looked briefly to either side   because if that s your burr then rest in my assurance 
postalcode  certain things are rock solid  high grade true  
freer had made a pincer of his fingers and was at the other cheek   let him cry  let baby have his dinkle  piss and moan  thirteen for christ s
sake  a kid thirteen hasn t even been in the same room with real disappointment yet  hasn t even locked eyes across a room with real disillusion
and and frustration and pain  thirteen  pain s a rumor  what s the word  angst  baby wouldn t know genuine article angst if it walked up and got
him in a headlock  
 not like real true real possible little cheek pimple angst  vike  hey  
 flip it over and squat  pemulis   without bothering to look  both pemulis and freer had pronounced a hard g in angst  hal would have observed 
the viking contorted his mouth and raised his big chin to check the flesh of his jaw  turning slightly to use the side mirrors as well 
pemulis smiled broadly  trying to envision keith freer sitting in a canvas restraint wrap in full lotus  staring blankly  hitting all the high notes in
 no business like show business  as orderlies in boiled whites and prim nurses in bent hats stand around snapping their fingers  clean white cheap
institutional care sneakers tapping noiselessly through all eternity  he was down to chinos and bare light brown feet  he considered a blue t shirt
with a black wolf spider on it v  a coincidentally red on gray t shirt that had  vodka is the enemy of production  in presumably russian  his good
four dunlop sticks were stacked on the bench to possalthwaite s left  he picked up two and tested the strings  tension by hitting the side of one
stick s head against the the strung face of the other and listening to the strings and then switching sticks and repeating the process  the exact right
tension has a certain pitch  midsized dunlop enqvist tl composites          u s  retail  real catgut strings have a kind of a dentalish sweet stink 
the dot and circumflex logo  he didn t much look at possalthwaite  he chose the cyrillic shirt with the bottle glyph  he rolled it up and put his head
through the head hole first  his late great da s old fashioned way  the upscaler kids here all did the arm holes first  then they did the head  you
can also tell the scholarship kids because for some reason they put on a sock and a shoe and then a sock and a shoe  see for instance wayne 
who d been in their room right after lunch when pemulis had made the decision to come up for some pre match tenuate  wayne s room was right
nearby and he was standing there over troeltsch s pharmacopic bedside table with no shirt and wet hair  rheumy eyed and shiny nostriled from
moisturizer on his kleenex chafed nostrils  the viking was squeezing a damp tennis ball with his left hand while he scanned his forehead by mostly
feel  pemulis s psychic counter strategy was not to appear in any hurry to dress and stretch and get out there either  pemulis   who feared and
hated unauthorized people being in his room  and who was constantly on schacht s back about forgetting to lock up when he left  and who wasn t
intimidated by wayne s talent and success and affectless reserve  but was cautious around him  john wayne  sort of the way a formidable predator
will be unintimidated but cautious around another formidable predator  particularly since the virtuosic but tense performance in a certain
administrative office a week ago  which had been mentioned by neither man   had coolly asked wayne if he could help him  and wayne had just
as coolly not looked up from rattling through sickly jim troeltsch s bedside table s stuff and said he d come in for some of troeltsch s seldane  

 which pemulis had indeed heard troeltsch at breakfast describing to a nose blowing wayne as the battlefield nuke of anti histamines that didn t
make you too drowsy to function at an incredibly high level of function  pemulis adjusted his jock s rear straps  trying to remember this waynememory s point  wayne had wanted a clear head and high pulmonary function because he was down to play the syrian satelliter in an informal
exhibition at i l h  wayne hadn t offered this explanation  pemulis got it off the e board  one reason pemulis was cautiously unassertive about
wayne s unauthorized presence in the room was the leaflet  which given a certain office incident it wasn t impossible wayne might choose to
suspect seeing pemulis s hand in the olde english fonted leaflet up at various boards and inserted on the e t a  tps  communal e board for      
announcing a joint john wayne dr  avril incandenza arithmetic presentation to the pre quadrivial    and unders on how    can actually go into   
way more than       times  the point was that the half dressed wayne had been standing there with one foot bare and one in a sock and shoe 
pemulis shook his head slightly and looked down at possalthwaite and tried to gather spit 
the speaker out up by the clock in the cement hall by the sauna crackled to life for the start of weekly weta  with its glass shattering joan
sutherland theme  pemulis put his street sneakers on his street shoe shelf   buck up  t p  it s just an angst spasm  you re just reeling from a
temporary paternal kertwang  philosophical truth s jutting out all over the place  disney world or no  nose or no  eschaton lives on  believe me 
underground or no  you have a calling  a talent  a missileman of your caliber  reach down and rally  me little button  
possalthwaite had taken his face from his hands and was staring stonily up somewhere past pemulis  lips moving in the habitual sucking reflex
for which he took so much guff  his face had the pink scrubbed look of a crying child all right  his hands had left brown spiders of tincture of
benzoin on his cheeks  he had two little smudges of bruise under the eyes  he sniffed meatily through a nose still covered in horizontal strips of
surgical tape   i ab dot a little button  
 that s what all the little buttons say  kid   the viking said levelly  removing something from a nostril with tweezers  pemulis s sinuses felt like
four laners and his sense of smell was a lot keener than a man in a locker room might wish  freer s locker next to gloeckner s next to good old
inc s was agape  the bolted colposcope gleaming in the overhead lights and his fox large head sticks a nauseous west coast fluorescent orange
with the trademark fox glyph painted on the strings 
possalthwaite scratched at one foot with the nails of the other foot   if you can t trust your folks      
 let me both validate and remind you that the kertwang you re reeling under is emotion based and not fact based  
possalthwaite opened his mouth 
 you re getting ready to say if you can t trust the ostensively loving patriarchal bosom you can t trust anyone at all  and if you can t trust people
what can you trust  in terms of unvarying dependability  postal weight  am i right  
 oh jesus h  christmastree here it comes   the viking said to his forehead s reflection 
pemulis was putting on a sock and a shoe  his mouth right down by postal weight s ear   this is not a bullshit problem  this is a like serious
emotiono philosophical deal you re confronting  i think it s a good sign you re coming to me instead of holding it all impactedly inside  
 who s coming to you   freer turned the big face this way and that   he was already in here having his little wa wa dinkle  
pemulis tried envisioning keith freer being bent over the net by bedouins in purple turbans and roundly buggered  making the sort of sounds
leith s historical b w j  gleason made when in pain  to possalthwaite he was saying  cause i can remember staring down the exact same type
thing  though from a more like philosophicalized kertwang than emotions  
freer said  do not ask him what he means  kid  
then a couple of   s came in  g    yardguard   rader and a marginal slavic kid whose first name was zoltan and whose last name nobody could
pronounce  and ignored freer s advice to run for their lives because the good dr  pemulis had been prescribing for himself again and was going to
begin to rant  and threw down their gear and proceeded immediately to get fresh towels from the dispenser over by the showers and to snap them
at each other 
 what do you mean   said possalthwaite 
 the snare closes  the trap closes  here it comes  
rader rolled his wrists and spiraled the towel for what he called maximum painage  the viking turned and said if he felt so much as a terrycloth
breeze on this personal ass right here they were toast  the two  pemulis was taking racquets out  e t a  s male   s were as a group inbent 
conspiratorial  glandular  cliqueish  they excluded anyone not in their set  they had techniques and strategems of exclusion way more advanced
than the   s or   s   they tended to exclude stice  mostly because he roomed with coyle and drilled a lot of the time up with the   s  and mixed
with them  and more recently kornspan  excluded  basically because he was cretinous and cruel and now consensually suspected of having tortured
and killed the two collarless cats whose burnt corpses had been found on the hillside during pre drill sprints a couple weeks back   they had their
own dialect and codes  in jokes inside in jokes f and at e t a  only   s snapped towels  and only for a year or two  but they went at it with a
vengeance  towel snapping  a brief flared genuflection to jock stereotype  a stage where there s this primate like passion for red assed bonding in
steamy rooms  they were the age staring down the barrel not of is anything true but of am i true  of what am i  of what is this thing  and it made
them strange 
then    s b c fence sitter duncan van slack  the kid who carried a guitar around with himself everyplace but never played it  and refused all
late night sitting around someone s room requests to play  and who was suspected of not being able to play the thing at all  and whose own da
was supposedly a redoubted gene sequencer in savannah  poked his head and guitar s neck in the door and said to come quick and then withdrew
his head before anybody could ask what was up 
 if you didn t have such a way with a launch vector i wouldn t be sure you re ready to hear this  postalscale  
 it occurs to me this is your boring man s true talent  the talent for ensnaring   says the viking   flee while you can  kid  
possalthwaite blew his nose in the crook of his elbow and left it there 
pemulis  who still used genuine catgut strings  zipped the two sticks he d chosen into their dunlop covers  he put an arch support shoe up on the
bench by postalweight s bottom  looking quickly right and left 
 todder  you can trust math  
freer said  you heard it here first  
pemulis compulsively zipped and unzipped one of the covers   take a breather  keith  todd  trust math  as in matics  math e  first order
predicate logic  never fail you  quantities and their relation  rates of change  the vital statistics of god or equivalent  when all else fails  when the
boulder s slid all the way back to the bottom  when the headless are blaming  when you do not know your way about  you can fall back and
regroup around math  whose truth is deductive truth  independent of sense or emotionality  the syllogism  the identity  modus tollens 
transitivity  heaven s theme song  the nightlight on life s dark wall  late at night  heaven s recipe book  the hydrogen spiral  the methane 
ammonia  h o  nucleic acids  a and g  t and c  the creeping inevibatility  caius is mortal  math is not mortal  what it is is  listen  it s true  
 this from a man on academic probation for who knows the length  
something involving freer and a saline moistened cattle prod refused to quite mentally gel  there was still none of tenuate s stomachless verve
or well being  just a glittered hum in his head and sinuses that felt like wind tunnels  pemulis tended to be a mouth breather  the viking raised one
leg to fart toward pemulis in a vaudevillian way  getting a laugh from csikszentmihalyi and rader  who d mostly undressed and taken seats on the
bench opposite pemulis and postal weight  towels hung unwinding in their hands  watching  and were only every once in a while and in a
halfhearted way pretending to look like they were getting ready to snap each other 
 i m not a math person  dad says   said postal weight  again the nose made the words come out dot and bath and persod  csikszentmihalyi
feinted a lunge and then really lunged and there was brief flurry of terrycloth 
pemulis unzipped the cover   the axiom  the lemma  listen   if two different sets of parametric equations represent the same curve j  but the
curve is traced in opposite directions in the two cases  then the two sets of equations produce values for a line integral over j that are negatives of
each other   not  if thus and such   not  unless a gladhand ing commercial realtor from boardman mn in      banfi loafers changes his mind  

 always and ever  as in puts the am a priori  an honest lamp in the inkiest black  tod dleposter  
there were voices and running feet like some sort of ruckus  mckenna stuck his head in and looked wildly around and withdrew without saying
anything  csikszentmihalyi went out after him  freer and rader both said what the fuck  pemulis had only one button of his fly buttoned and was
pointing at the ceiling with a finger 
       only that at times like this  when you re directionless in a dark wood  trust to the abstract deductive  when driven to your knees  kneel and
revere the double s  leap like a knight of faith into the arms of peano  leibniz  hubert  l hopital  you will be lifted up  fourier  gauss  laplace 
rickey  borne up  never let fall  wiener  reimann  frege  green  
csikszentmihalyi came back in with ortho stice  their color high 
pemulis compulsively zips and unzips zippers  is the reason why he wears only button fly pants and tennis shorts 
cs yi said  there is expression  you must immediately come  
freer turned from the mirror  both hands on a comb   what the fuck s going on  
 john wayne is insanely holding forth innermost thoughts for public ears  
 never trust the father you can see   pemulis told possalthwaite 
stice was already on his way back out and said over his shoulder   troeltsch s got wayne on the air and wayne s lost his mind  
a  like dry loamy clay  highly absorbent  used by some for traction on their grips  eschewed by others because it has a lot of aluminum silicates
and the y t m p  s  aluminum causes impotence  panic still weighs hard on some pubescent players  minds 
b  a good many seniors  schedules have no last period classes  or have independent study stuff slated for last period  and when two of these
seniors   e g  pemulis   freer   are scheduled for a p m  challenge match  they get to start at     h  instead of     h   and usually then finish
up early  which is a great perk  given that they ll get to hit both the weight room and the locker room at slack and empty times 
c  an advantage of competitive mediocrity is you get to sit in the stands and get lots of sun on your feet and chest  because you re knocked out
of competition by like the second round  hence grotesquely pale feet are sort of a perverse mark of competitive status  maybe like toothlessness in
hockey or something

   nov  y d a u 
 gracious me and mine   pemulis said  clutching the ankle of the leg he d crossed to keep the foot from joggling 
 rusk and charles and mrs  incandenza are with him now  schtitt s been up to see him  loach has done a thorough reflex check  john wayne s
going to be ok  
 well thank heavens for that load off everyone s mind   pemulis said 
it was pemulis  delint  nwangi  and watson in the dean of academic affairs  office  mrs  inc s ventilator hissed and something up in there
whirred a little  delint was behind the high desk  looking like a mean little boy  nobody d said if anybody higher up than delint was going to show 
pemulis didn t know if this was good or bad 
 let s make perfectly sure we got this in order and in your words   nwangi and watson were window dressing  this was a  delint s show  his
face kind of came apart when he smiled   with no prior knowledge of anything untoward  you re pulled from the locker room and stand out in the
hall with several other students  which is your first knowledge anything s untoward with wayne  
pemulis figured none of the administrators had heard the thing  they always shut their soundproof doors at i   h   pemulis had no idea what
wayne s said about anything  or jim troeltsch  who very prudently hasn t shown facial feature one in their room since the apocalyptic broadcast 
it d taken pemulis about half the salivaless sprint up to b     to figure out what had happened and to find his pilfered tenuates in the little
pecker s sel dane bottle  pemulis sort of shuddered to imagine the impact of the  drine on wayne s cherry red and virgin bloodstream  the slight
whir of his cortex working at full speed was masked by the hiss of the ventilator and the sound of whistles and play and schtitt s megaphone
outside 
 i m in there suiting up waiting for freer and doing a little b b  intervention on pos salthwaite who was in crisis and zoltan and the darkness
come like spasming in saying troeltsch d jury rigged the duke into candid sharing for the weta broadcast  
 they said what  that troeltsch had tricked wayne into speaking candidly without awareness it s going out over weta into all the rooms  
pemulis realized the limpness of this  in like that anybody d see that wayne d have to have been sitting right there with troeltsch by the little
old time gunmetal handheld mike at lateral alice moore s curved desk  he d already heard from lateral alice that it was more like wayne had come
rattling in and shoved troeltsch aside and grabbed the mike and started ranting while troeltsch and lateral alice moore had looked on aghastly 
and that dave harde  down doing some maintainance to l a m  s deactivated third rail  had been so aghasted he d pitched forward narcoleptically
and stayed like that with his face in the blue carpet and ass in the air for nearly an hour  and that lateral alice s own stress had brought on an
aggravation of her chronic cyanosis to the point where her whole face was still blue tinged and between her knees when pemulis had got to her 
 this was more like a general sort of impression which i feel like i might have misbegotten from the agitation of the guys  plus how completely
un wayneish wayne sounded  like how could anybody ever have said that shit if they thought it wasn t just them and troeltsch alone  much less
wayne  who as we all know is pretty much reserve in motion  
delint s nostrils got that pale flare they got  pemulis knew  when he smelled horseshit and knew you knew it  pemulis knows delint s been laying
for him ever since the incident with the p w t a  guy who started to wobble and then rant down at p w t a   which was a totally different type of
deal  the irony was that the wayne dosing had been a total accident and in no way pemulis s deal  if anybody s troeltsch s  but the cortex couldn t
nail down any way to get this across without admitting to possession of a  drine  which given the shaky pharmaceutical ground since the eschaton
and o n a n t a  urologist would be tantamount to clippertonizing himself  nwangi showed almost blinding  rd world teeth but was saying
nothing  watson s eyes had almost this nictitater of stupidity film on them  less a dullness than a deadness  the dead porch light of nobody home at
chez tex watson  pemulis saw the leaflet about wayne and mrs  i  and deviant division in the papers delint held 
 which is in your words your first knowledge of untowardness with wayne  
 my first is i get out there still trying to counsel the postheimer and here on the speaker s wayne doing what keith observed may have been a
sort of imitation of dr  tavis  

 it had been uncanny  it had made stice look like a rank amateur  wayne had told troeltsch to pretend he was some adolescent girl  this was
adolescent tavis asking her for a date  pemulis shuddered  he couldn t exactly remember all the little mannerisms  which wayne d clearly gotten
locked down from tavis always sitting next to him on the bus back from victories going at him nonstop  but in outline it was chuckie tavis coming
up to some canadian cheerleader or something and telling her he was going to be completely open with her  he had a terrible fear of rejection  he
was telling her up front now that tomorrow he was going to ask her out for a date and was begging her not openly to reject him if she didn t want
to go  to think up some plausible excuse   though of course he said he realized that what he was saying would make that excuse hard to believe 
now that he s openly asked her to make up an excuse 
 whereupon the whole academy hears mr  troeltsch prompt wayne into making public castigations of his various peers and instructors  
 i ve got to say it did seem like troeltsch had kind of orchestrated things somehow  sir  was my impression  
 referring to corbett thorp as a    pretending to riffle through the papers so pemulis d have to see the    into    leaflet several times as it
came up in the riffle 
 i believe the expression was  a palsied twit     nwangi said to delint 
 yes  palsied twit   and francis unwin quote  has the on court look of a cornered rodent   and disney r  leith  the quote  sort of man you
always end up sitting next to at civic functions   ms  richardson levy o byrne chawaf as chair of some sort of committee dealing with the topic of
the quote  itty bitty titty   on coach schtitt  quote  seeming as if he d been  denied some kind of vitally important moisture from birth henceforward   our own mr  nwangi here being in rough quote if i ve got it quote  the sort of fellow who ll be in a chinese restaurant with you and won t
even share food or trade food    
 meaning mean spirited   nwangi threw his head back and beamed like he was blind  what was chilling was that in wayne s scenario tavis does
succeed  wayne projects  in seducing the canadian cheerleader or whatever  even when he s totally open on the date about the fact that he d
deliberately told her he was afraid of rejection in the first place only as a strategy to make him seem to her different from other boys  more honest
and open  so that the scenario was that the honesty was so exhausting she d basically just laid back exhausted and let him x her just to shut him
up  except   chillingly   he hadn t shut up 
   including some sort of imitation of dr  tavis carrying on a monologue during the act of sexual intercourse   delint said  trying to find it in the
sheaf   on bernadette long ley   bernadette longley looks like her hair grew her head instead of the other way around   on mary esther thode   a
face like a pancake   on the academy s own late founder and husband of the dean of ac  aff    so full of himself he could have shit limbs  
unquote  on his own doubles partner hal incandenza   by all appearances addicted to everything that is not tied down  cannot outrun him  and is
fittable in the mouth    
 i m remembering the word as insertable   pemulis kicked himself  mentally  the pancake thing had been expanded to like fifteen seconds as
wayne had sketched m  e  thode s face as circular  burned  freckled  cratered  doughy  shiny  soggy  on and on  plus somehow even more chilling
was that pemulis knew from inc that wayne s pseudo tavis  i live in fear of rejection  ploy was actually in the top five or ten of the troubling
 strategies  that inc s brother orin the punter called up to hal about employing to x young married women 
 donni stott has we re informed  skin like an attache case and is a compelling advertisement for sunscreen   i myself am  here i quote  quote  a
man who would not lend his own mother a quarter for a rubber tip for her crutch    
 is the emerging point that this is going to impact my getting to go on the whataburger trip  
nwangi crumpled and slapped his knee  his face literally looked like a very dark hatchet  tex watson reached down behind the console he was
slumped in his chair by and brought out pemulis s special yachting cap and dangled it like something you want a dog to jump for  from someplace
under nwangi s chair were brought out two pharmaceutical scales  several jeweller s loupes  the tow truck s supply of empty sterile visine bottles 
and plus every bottle from troeltsch s bedside table  which clearly troeltsch had eaten some enormous wedge of putrid deal cutting cheese 
pemulis tasted the metallic taste of a seriously anxious stomach   i request to see the dean of ac  aff  before any of this goes further  
 we have again ms  heath  apparently on someone s mind very much today  now said to be the sort of person who quote  cries at card tricks  
we have a rik dunkel who  could not find his own bottom with both hands and a nautical compass of exacting precision   we have a return
engagement with ms  heath  described as  dwelling always at the edge of some vast continent of menstrual hysteria   we have our own beloved
tex  sitting right here  described as having  a tiny liquid filled nubbin at the top of the spine  in lieu of higher cortex function  
 aubs  no kidding  something pressing i have to interface about with mrs  inc  tell her it concerns u s  canadian relations  
nwangi s laugh was high and had the slight teakettle wheeze to it of the laughs of large black men the world over   she sends you her regards 
the dean said to tell you   he slapped his knee three times 
delint looked a little less happy because he clearly didn t know what any of it was about and didn t like playing coded messenger  but he still
looked pretty happy   michael mathew pemulis  the academy s dean of academic affairs said to tell you the administration s too naturally concerned
about the state of one of our two very finest current talents  who it s clear he s been unwittily dosed with an artificial stimulant prohibited by federal
statute  o n a n t a  regulations  and the enfield tennis academy honor code specs on artificial substances  to permit itself the satisfaction of
giving you the dean s very best regards and her wish that quote  may the road rise up to meet you whitherever your future travels lie     delint
probed his ear   i think that was it in a nutshell  
pemulis got very cool and brass mask faced  he was breathing very clearly through his nose  and the office air seemed mentholated  everything
got very cool and formal inside and glycerine clear   aubs  before anything gets nailed in stone that we ll all i promise you and mrs  inc we ll all of
us regret   
delint said  i was given to understand you can either finish out the term for credit or you can hit the trail with your little sailing cap full of
pockets on a stick like a bandanna to some other o n a n t a  institution and see if they ll take a senior without any kind of positive reference 
which the sense i get is the administration says fat chance on any kind of reference  
tex watson said something about urine 
pemulis recrossed his leg  delint looked at nwangi 
 i believe the kid is speechless  
 i believe he has nothing to say  
 i don t believe it  
 and something about you re invited to shout whatever you threatened the administration to shout about from the highest hill you can find 
which pretty soon won t be this one  
nwangi got out through laughter   and that the administrative office doorknobs have been rubberized and grounded  the administrative files all
